The faster we're falling, we're stopping and stalling
We're running in circles again
Just as things were looking up, you said it wasn't good enough
But still, we're trying one more time

Maybe we're just trying too hard
When really, it's closer than it is too far

'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head, instead of going under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head, instead of going under
Instead of going under

Seems like each time I'm with you, I lose my mind
Because I'm bending over backwards to relate
It's one thing to complain, but when you're driving me insane
Well then, I think it's time that we took a break

Maybe we're just trying too hard
When really, it's closer than it is too far
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head, instead of going under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head, instead of going under
Instead of going under (Instead of going under)
Instead of going under


I can't sit back and wonder why
It took so long for this to die
And I hate it when you fake it
You can't hide it, you might as well embrace it
So believe me, it's not easy
It seems that something's telling me

I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head, instead of going under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head, instead of going under
Instead of going under

Instead of going under again
Instead of going under
Instead of going under again
Instead of going under again
Instead of going under again16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Storming through the party like my name was El Niño
When I'm hangin' out drinking in the back of an El Camino
As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name
Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came

I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never going, never showing up when we had to
Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearing "act your age"

I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

Because you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience so small?
Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised
Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised

'Cause we like having fun at other people's expense and
Cutting people down is just a minor offense then
It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn
I'm sick of being told to wait my turn
I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

Don't count on me to let you know when
Don't count on me, I'll do it again
Don't count on me, it's the point you're missing
Don't count on me, 'cause I'm not listening

Well I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat
Back-packed, and I don't give a shit about nothing
You be standing on the corner talking all that kufuffin
But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing
'Cause if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringing off the hook
You're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book
I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion
The doctor said my mom should've had an abortion

I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down
(Waste my time with them)
Casualty of society
(Waste my time with them)
Victim of your conformity and back down27EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I tried to be perfect, but nothing was worth it
I don't believe it makes me real
I thought it'd be easy, but no one believes me
I meant all the things I said

If you believe it's in my soul
I'd say all the words that I know
Just to see if it would show
That I'm trying to let you know
That I'm better off on my own

This place is so empty, my thoughts are so tempting
I don't know how it got so bad
Sometimes it's so crazy that nothing can save me
But it's the only thing that I have

If you believe it's in my soul
I'd say all the words that I know
Just to see if it would show
That I'm trying to let you know
That I'm better off on my own
On my own!

I tried to be perfect, it just wasn't worth it
Nothing could ever be so wrong
It's hard to believe me, it never gets easy
I guess I knew that all along

If you believe it's in my soul
I'd say all the words that I know
Just to see if it would show
That I'm trying to let you know

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Drop dead
A bullet to my head
Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
These eyes
Have seen no conviction
Just lies and more contradiction
So tell me what would you say
I'd say it's up to me

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Ignorance
And understanding
We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But who's left to stop the bleeding?
How far
Will we take this?
It's not hard to see through the fakeness
So tell me what would you say
I'd say it's up to me
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe

This can't last forever
Time won't make things better
I feel so alone
Can't help myself
And no one knows
If this
Is worthless
Tell me (tell me, tell me)
So
What have we done
With a war that can't be won?
This can't be real
'Cause I don't know what to feel, no

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
For this world to believe14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I don't want this moment to ever end
Where everything's nothing without you
I'd wait here forever just to, to see you smile
'Cause it's true, I am nothing without you

Through it all, I've made my mistakes
I stumble and fall, but I mean these words

I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul (so I hold on)
I'll hold on to this moment, you know
As I bleed my heart out to show, and I won't let go

Thoughts ran unspoken, forever in vow
And pieces of memories fall to the ground
I know what I didn't have, so I won't let this go
'Cause it's true, I am nothing without you

All the streets where I walked alone
With nowhere to go have come to an end
I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul (so I hold on)
I'll hold on to this moment, you know
As I bleed my heart out to show, and I won't let go

In front of your eyes, it falls from the skies
When you don't know what you're looking to find
In front of your eyes, it falls from the skies
When you just never know what you will find
What you will find, what you will find
What you will find, what you will find


I don't want this moment to ever end
Where everything's nothing without you

I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul (so I hold on)
I'll hold on to this moment, you know
As I bleed my heart out to show, and I won't let go
I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul (so I hold on)
I'll hold on to this moment, you know
As I bleed my heart out to show, and I won't let go

Everybody's got their problems
Everybody says the same things to you
It's just a matter how you solve them
And knowing how to change the things you've been through
I feel I've come to realize
How fast life can be compromised
Step back to see what's going on
I can't believe this happened to you
(This happened to you)

It's just a problem that I'm faced with; am I
Not the only one who hates to stand by?
Complications that are first in this line
With all these pictures running through my mind
Knowing endless consequences
I feel so useless in this
Get back, step back, and as for me
I can't believe

Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure
Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure anymore
Everybody's got their problems
Everybody says the same things to you
It's just a matter how you solve them
But what else are we supposed to do?

Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure
Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure anymore

Why do things that matter the most
Never end up being what we chose
Now that I find no way so bad
I don't think I knew what I had

Even though you’re never there, I didn’t feel you disappear
From sight, you did it well

I haven't been home for a while, I'm sure everything's the same
Mom and dad both in denial, an only child to take the blame
Sorry mom, but I don't miss you, father's no name you deserve
I'm just a kid with no ambitions, wouldn't come home for the world
You'll never know what I've become, the king of all that's said and
Done, the forgotten son
This city's buried in defeat, I walk along these no name streets
Wave goodbye to all as I fall...

At the dead end I begin to burn the bridge of innocence
Satisfaction guaranteed a pill away catastrophe
On a mission, nowhere bound, inhibitions underground
A shallow grave I have dug all by myself

And now I've been gone for so long
I can't remember who was wrong
All innocence is long gone
I pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief where I belong

A walking disaster, the son of all bastards
You regret you made me, it's too late to save me
(You regret you made me, it's too late to save me)

And he said, "Far as I can tell, it's just voices in my head
Am I talking to myself 'cause I don't know what I just said?"
And she said, "Far is where I fell, maybe I'm better off dead
Am I at the end of nowhere, is this as good as it gets?"

And now I've been gone for so long
I can't remember who was wrong
All innocence is long gone
I pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief where I belong

A walking disaster, the son of all bastards
You regret you made me, it's too late to save me

To save me, to save me, to save me, to save me

Zero chances, no way out
No solutions, give in now
There's no point resisting, there's nobody listening
Are we just sick? (Sick)
Are we just tired? (Tired)
Apathetic, uninspired
What's to believe in, there's nobody leading

So tell me what's real
I don't know if I can feel

All that we have is just slipping away
And I don't believe that it's gonna be okay
You can't stop the bleeding, it's almost too late
You're leaving us all behind with hell to pay

All of the dearly beloved
Your time is up, they're out for blood
Misery made us so hopelessly faithless (Hey)
And now I can't believe (Hey) a single word that you say (Say)
Secrets kept, a thin disguise, empty threats are full of lies (Hey)
Do what you will, you just add to your bill now
So tell me what's right
I don't see the light

All that we have is just slipping away
And I don't believe that it's gonna be okay
You can't stop the bleeding, it's almost too late
You're leaving us all behind with hell to pay

Silence, they don't hear you calling
The further down you fall
No, they're not there at all

So, what am I fighting for? Everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go, I’m ready to settle the score

Get ready, 'cause this is war

There are days that I think I’m crazy
Other days, nothing seems to faze me
There’s nothing more, and nothing less, just
All the fears that I must confess, well
I’m afraid I believe in nothing
No hopes or dreams, you could’ve left me dead
Naive and not to mention
I’m losing count of all my blessings (with all I've done...)

With all that I’ve done, it’s too late
I can’t take back all that I have become

So, all that I’m trying to say, I’m looking for a better way

Another day in the right direction
I’m okay, but I’m left to question
How did I get so far behind the rest?
Why am I so inclined to forget?
All the days that you made me crazy
Nowadays, you don’t even faze me
It’s all the same, and I don’t stress none
Sick and tired of all this tension (with all I've done...)

I never told you how I felt
Though I thought I'd said it all
And I never knew you needed help
Well, 'cause you always seemed so tough
But now I'm here alone
Without you by my side
If only I had known
That you kept it all inside
Now I'm trying to understand
Just trying to find a way
But forgive you, I just can't
It's all just too much for me to take

And if I failed you, well, I swear I tried my best
But now you're gone, so all your tears can lay to rest
Just so you know
You meant the world to us, I know that it's too late
And all I want's another chance, I can't accept that you have left

Look at all this damage done
Are you happy with yourself?
And we thought the best was yet to come
And, and I thought I knew you oh so well
And the days just go by
While the moment seems to last
Like catching fire
All is gone, and it all went up so fast

Well, I won't be caught living in a dead-end job
While praying to my government, guns, and God
Now it's us against them, we're here to represent
And spit right in the face of the establishment

And now I don't believe (in having faith in nothing)
Stand on my own (and got no sympathy)
Wasting the youth (while being young and useless)
Speak for yourself (and don't pray for me)

Well, because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you, 'cause we'll
Be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold, just like you

A call across the Underclass!

Calling out loud with no respect
I'm not the one, I'm just another reject
I'm the voice to offend all those who pretend
Unsung against the grain, I'm here to rise against
Now I'm desensitized (I state my place in nowhere)
Burning the flag (of the degeneration)
Everyone sing (the anthem of no future)
Down with the mass ('cause we're not listening)

Well, because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you, 'cause we'll
Be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold, just like you

May I have your attention please?
I pledge allegiance to the Underclass as your hero at large!

Far in, ohhhh. Wait, we singing?
Take everything left from me!
All! To! Blame!

How can we still succeed taking what we don't need?
Telling lies, alibis, selling all the hate that we breed
Super-size our tragedies (you can't define me, or justify greed)
Bought in the land of the free (land, free)

And we're all to blame
We've gone too far, from pride to shame
We're trying so hard, we're dying in vain
We're hopelessly blissful and blind to all we are

We want it all with no sacrifice!

Realize we spend our lives living in a culture of fear
Stand to salute, say thanks to the man of the year
How did we all come to this? (you can't define me, or justify greed)
A greed that we just can't resist (resist)
And we're all to blame
We've gone too far, from pride to shame
We're trying so hard, we're dying in vain
We're hopelessly blissful and blind to all we are

We want it all, everyone wants it all, with no sacrifice!

Tell me now, what have we done
We don't know, I can't allow
What has begun to tear me down, believe me now
We have no choice left with our backs against the wall!

And now we're all to blame
We've gone too far from pride to shame
We're hopelessly blissful and blind, when all we need
Is something true to believe

Don't we all, everyone, everyone, we will fall

You played the victim for so long now in this game

You're something to few, but nothing to me
Someone so twisted and sick as can be
It wasn't the plan, we gave it a shot
You've proven a real man is something you're not

So tell me, is this what the future primitive world's supposed to be?
A total abomination is what it looks like to me
No reasonable explanation, can't call it a declaration
A bigot to all, sick of it all, we all stand up, go

I believe that I
Am losing faith in all of humankind
But then I realize it's plain to see
That a number is all you are to me

Not worthy of name, a number you'll get
A symbol of meaningless, void of respect
A matter of time, you get what you've earned
We'll take pleasure in watching you burn

What's the difference of never knowing at all
When every step I take is always too small?
Maybe it's just something I can't admit
But lately, I feel like I don't give a shit

Motivation's such an aggravation
Accusations, don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration, never hard to break it
Situation never what you want it to be

What's the point of never making mistakes?
Self-indulgence, such a hard habit to break
It's all just a waste of time in the end
Don't care, so why should I even pretend?

Falling further behind (There's nothing to explain)
No matter what you say, nothing's gonna change my mind


Can't depend on doubt until the end
It seems like leaving friends has become this year's trend
And though I can't pretend, afraid to be this way
It's not the same, but who's to blame
For all those stupid things I never said?

Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration, situation never what you want it to be

Never what you want it to be
Never what you want it to be2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Where do I begin? 'Cause my story's still untold
Left to be unwritten like memories to unfold
And I don't believe the truth, it doesn't make me feel alive
The truth's just overrated, we've all got something to hide

Cause lies make it so much fun
So sing the praise of insincerity
Make this your last prayer
As the dream becomes your worst nightmare

I'm not your savior or a saint, no use praying for escape
I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head
Just another crying shame, life is such a deadly game
Gone wrong, fire at will, put a bullet in his head

Pay me no more mind, have I really come undone?
I left the world this evening just to kill the sun
And I've got no more to bleed, all that's left will soon be gone
Especially before my mind fades like the stars at dawn
Well I bet you got a lot to say
So have it your way and crucify me
Make this your your last prayer
As the dream becomes your worst nightmare

I'm not your savior or a saint, no use praying for escape
I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head
Just another crying shame, life is such a deadly game
Gone wrong, fire at will, put a bullet in his head

Breathless kiss to end all this, I fall, I say goodbye to all
Close my eyes, oh, sweet demise, a love that no one understands

And I don't believe in redemption
And no one will be spared
There's 32 ways you can die here tonight
It's a fucking family affair


I'm not your savior or a saint, no use praying for escape
I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head
Just another crying shame, life is such a deadly game
Gone wrong, fire at will, put a bullet in his head1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm not quite myself these days
Guess we all come undone time to time in different ways, well
I have myself to blame
Guess I don't understand, I need help in many ways

God's got a plan for me, well, I'm going to tell you one thing
I don't got the patience, or the time
What can I say, I'm no angel
I'm not forsaken, but I can bleed!

Tear me open, I believe God will set you up to bleed
And no one can deceive what is meant to be
And "Bloody Murder!" we will scream

Well, I guess it's time for me, tell me what I'm left to believe in
'Cause I don't know the concept of the pain
I don't want the faith, I'll just lose it
I can prove it, watch me bleed!

Tear me open, I believe God will set you up to bleed
And no one can deceive what is meant to be
And "Bloody Murder!" we will scream
God will set you up to tear me open!

'Cause I'm (Hey!) not giving up (Hey!)
No self-control, suffocated to the plough
I'm my (Hey!) worst enemy (Hey!)
Who can't be saved, I'm just his disgrace

Tear me open, I believe God will set you up to bleed
And no one can deceive what is meant to be
And "Bloody Murder!" we will scream
God will set you up to tear me open!

These days are strange, it's true
There's not a thing that I would change, no mistakes that I'd undo...3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

All of us believe that this is not up to you!
The fact of the matter is that it's up to me!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Let's go!

How can we fake this anymore? (Anymore)
To turn our backs away and choose to just ignore
(Choose to just ignore)
(Some say!) Some say it's ignorance
It makes me feel some innocence
(Some say!) It takes away a part of me
That I won't let go of

Tell me, why can't you see it's not the way? (Not the way!)
When we all fall down, it will be too late
Why is there no reason we can't change? (No reason!)
When we all fall down, who will take the blame? Will it take?

Nothing could ever be this real (Be this real)
A life unsatisfied that I could never feel (I could never feel)
(Some say!) This future's not so bright
That some can't make the sacrifice (So bright!)
It's much more than just black and white
And I won't follow
Tell me, why can't you see it's not the way? (Not the way!)
When we all fall down, it will be too late
Why is there no reason we can't change? (No reason!)
When we all fall down, who will take the blame? Will it take?

Times like these, I've come to see how
Everything but time is running out
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
(What!) All of us believe in what we need
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
What we have's what we don't see

Tell me, why can't you see it's not the way? (Not the way!)
When we all fall down, it will be too late
Why is there no reason we can't change? (No reason!)
When we all fall down, who will take the blame? Will it take?

Can't you see it's not the way? (Not the way!)
(So how long, has this gone, I don't see this ending)
When we all fall down, it won't be too late
(It's too late, we can't change what has now begun)
Why is there no reason we can't change? (No reason!)
(We have time, it's not right, why are we pretending?)
When we all fall down, who will take the blame? Will it take?
(We fit along, for so long, we knew this all along)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
