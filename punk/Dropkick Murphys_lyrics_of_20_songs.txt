The pictures tell the story
This life has many shades
I’d wake up every morning and before I’d start each day
I’d take a drag from last nights cigarette
That smoldered in its tray
Down a little something and then be on my way
I traveled far and wide
And laid this head in many ports
I was guided by a compass
I saw beauty to the north
I drew the tales of many lives
And wore the faces of my own
I had these memories all around me
So I wouldn’t be alone

Some may be from showing up
Others are from growing up
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn’t have a clue
I ain’t winning no one over
I wear it just for you
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo
In a rose tattoo
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo
This ones for the mighty sea
Mischief, gold and piracy
This ones for the man that raised me
Taught me sacrifice and bravery
This ones for our favorite game
Black and gold, we wave the flag
This ones for my family name
With pride I wear it to the grave

Some may be from showing up
Others are from growing up
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn't have a clue
I ain't winning no one over
I wear it just for you
I’ve got your name written here

I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo
This one means the most to me
Stays here for eternity
A ship that always stays the course
An anchor for my every choice
A rose that shines down from above
I signed and sealed these words in blood
I heard them once, sung in a song
It played again and we sang along

You’ll always be there with me
Even if you’re gone
You’ll always have my love
Our memory will live on

Some may be from showing up
Others are from growing up
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn’t have a clue
I ain’t winning no one over
I wear it just for you

While on the road to sweet Athy, hurroo hurroo
While on the road to sweet Athy, hurroo hurroo
While on the road to sweet Athy
A stick in the hand, a drop in the eye
A doleful damsel I did cry
Johnny I hardly knew ya

Where are the eyes that looked so mild, hurroo hurroo
Where are the eyes that looked so mild, hurroo hurroo
Where are the eyes that looked so mild
When my poor heart you first beguiled
Why did ya run from me and the child
Johnny I hardly knew ya

We had guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns
The enemy never slew ya
Johnny I hardly knew ya

Where are the legs with which you run, hurroo hurroo
Where are the legs with which you run, hurroo hurroo

When first you went to carry a gun
Indeed your dancing days are done, Johnny I hardly knew ya
We had guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo hurroo

We had guns and drums and drums and guns
The enemy never slew ya

You hadn't an arm, you hadn't a leg, hurroo hurroo
You hadn't an arm, you hadn't a leg, hurroo hurroo
You hadn't an arm, you hadn't a leg
You're an eyeless, boneless, chickenless egg
You'll have to be put with the bowl to beg
Johnny I hardly knew ya

We had guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns
The enemy never slew ya
Johnny I hardly knew ya

I'm happy for to see ya home, hurroo hurroo
I'm happy for to see ya home, hurroo hurroo
I'm happy for to see ya home from the isle of Ceylon

She had excuses and she chose to use them
She was the victim of unspeakable abuses
Her husband was violent, malicious, and distant
Her kids now belong to the state of Massachusetts

They've been taken away! Hey!
They've been taken away!

Billy was a bright one, Tommy's off his head
Mother loved them both the same, at least that's what she said
I don't predict the future, I don't care about the past
Send them both to DSS, now you've had your chance

The poison stole your babies
The judges took your rights
You can have your children... or the night!

I suppose you've been a victim, I suspect you may have lied
Have you lost all ambition, won't you give this thing a try
If you can't and you fail, you won't be the only loser
These kids don't stand a chance with you in their future
They've been taken away! (Hey!)
They've been taken away!

I play in a band, we're the best in the land
We're big in both Chelsea and France
I play one mean guitar and then score at the bar
There's a line of chicks waiting for their chance
So come on now honey, I'll make you feel pretty
These other gals mean nothing to me
Let's finish these drinks and be gone for the night
'Cause I'm more than a handful, you'll see

So kiss me, I'm shitfaced
I'm soaked, I'm soiled and brown
In the trousers, she kissed me
And I only bought her one round

I can bench press a car, I'm an ex-football star
With degrees from both Harvard and Yale
Girls just can't keep up, I'm a real love machine
I've had far better sex while in jail
I designed the Sears Tower, I make two grand an hour
I cook the world's best duck flambé
I'll take the pick of the litter, girls jockey for me
I don't need these lines to get laid
So kiss me, I'm shitfaced
I'm soaked, I'm soiled and brown
In the trousers, she kissed me
And I only bought her one round

I'm a man of the night, a real ladies delight
See my figure was chiseled from stone
One more for the gal then I'll escort her home
Come last call, I'm never alone
I've a house on the hill with a red water bed
That puts Hugh Hefner's mansion to shame
With girls by the pool and Italian sports cars
I'm just here in this dump for the game

So kiss me, I'm shitfaced
I'm soaked, I'm soiled and brown
In the trousers, she kissed me
And I only bought her one round
So kiss me, I'm shitfaced
I'm soaked, I'm soiled and brown
In the trousers, she kissed me
And I only bought her one round
Ahh, fuck it. Who am I shitting?
I'm a pitiful sight, and I ain't all that bright
I'm definitely not chiseled from stone
I'm a cheat and a liar, no woman's desire
I'll probably die cold and alone
But just give me a chance, 'cause deep down inside
I swear I got a big heart of gold
I'm a monogamous man, no more one night stands
Come on, honey, let me take you home

So kiss me, I'm shitfaced
I'm soaked, I'm soiled and brown
In the trousers, she kissed me
And I only bought her one round
So kiss me, I'm shitfaced
I'm soaked, I'm soiled and brown
In the trousers, (Yo, it's tiny!)
And I only bought her one round
(Woo! One round!)
So kiss me, I'm shitfaced
I'm soaked, I'm soiled and brown
In the trousers, she kissed me
And I only bought her one round
So kiss me, I'm shitfaced
I'm soaked, I'm soiled and brown
In the trousers, she kissed me

I've seen a lot of sights and traveled many miles
Shook a thousand hands and seen my share of smiles
I've caused some great concern and told one too many lies
And now I see the world through these sad, old, jaded eyes

So what if I threw a party and all my friends were there?
Acquaintances, relatives, the girls who never cared
You'll have a host of rowdy hooligans in a big line out the door
Side by side with sister barbara, Chief Wells and Bobby Orr
I'd invite the Flannigans
Replace the window you smashed out
I'd apologize to sluggo for pissing on his couch
I'll see Mrs. McAuliffe and so many others soon
Then I'll say I'm sorry for what I did sleepwalking in her room

So what if I threw a party and invited Mayor Menino?
He'd tell you to get a permit
Well this time, Tom, I don't think so
It's a neighborhood reunion
But now we'd get along
Van Morrison would be there and he'd sang me one last song
With a backup band of bass players to keep us up all night
Three handsome four string troubadours and Newton's own Fat Mike
I'll be in the can having a smoke with Garv and Johnny Fitz
But there's a backup in the bathroom cause The Badger's got the shits
You may bury me with an enemy in Mount Calvary
You can stack me on a pyre and soak me down with whiskey
Roast me to a blackened crisp and throw me in a pile
I couldn't really give a shit; I'm going out in style
You can take my urn to Fenway spread my ashes all about
Or you can bring me down to Wolly Beach and dump the sucker out
Burn me to a rotten crisp and toast me for a while
I couldn't really give a shit; I'm going out in style

Make me up dress me up, feed me a big old shot
Of embalming fluid highballs so i don't start to rot
Now take me to McGreevy's, i wanna buy one final round
That cheap prick would peel an orange in his pocket
Then hurry up and suck 'em down

If there's a god the girls you loved will all come walking through the door
Maybe they'll feel bad for me and this stiff will finally score
You've got the bed already
And nerve and courage too
Cause i've been slugging from a stash of desi queally's 1980s bathtub brew

You may bury me with an enemy in Mount Calvary
You can stack me on a pyre and soak me down with whiskey
Roast me to a blackened crisp and throw me in a pile
I couldn't really give a shit; I'm going out in style
You can take my urn to Fenway spread my ashes all about
Or you can bring me down to Wolly Beach and dump the sucker out
Burn me to a rotten crisp and toast me for a while

Tessie is the Royal Rooters rally cry
Tessie is the tune they always sung
Tessie echoed April through October nights
After serenading Stahl, Dinneen and Young
Tessie is a maiden with a sparkling eye
Tessie is a maiden with a love
She doesn’t know the meaning of her sight
She’s got a comment full of love
And sometimes when the game is on the line
Tessie always carried them away
Up the road from third base to Huntington
The boys would always sing and sway

Two! Three! Four!
Tessie, Nuf Ced McGreevey shouted
We’re not here to mess around
Boston you know we love you madly
Hear the crowd roar to your sound
Don’t blame us if we ever doubt you
You know we couldn’t live without you
Tessie, you are the only only only
The Rooters showed up at the grounds one day
They found their seats had all been sold
McGreevey led the charge into the park
Stormed the gates and put the game on hold
The Rooters gave the other team a dreadful fright
Boston’s tenth man could not be wrong
Up from third base to Huntington
They’d sing another victory song
Two! Three! Four!
Tessie, Nuff Ced McGreevy shouted
We’re not here to mess around
Boston, you know we love you madly
Hear the crowd roar to your sound
Don’t blame us if we ever doubt you
You know we couldn’t live without you
Tessie, you are the only, only, only
The Rooters gave the other team a dreadful fright
Boston’s tenth man could not be wrong
Up from third base to Huntington
They’d sing another victory song

Two! Three! Four!
Tessie, Nuff Ced McGreevy shouted
We’re not here to mess around
Boston, you know we love you madly
Hear the crowd roar to your sound
Don’t blame us if we ever doubt you
You know we couldn’t live without you
Tessie, you are the only, only, only
Don’t blame us if we ever doubt you
You know we couldn’t live without you
Boston you are the only only only
Don’t blame us if we ever doubt you
You know we couldn’t live without you
Red Sox you are the only only only3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(Never take your loved once for granted:
They could be gone tomorrow)
All of my dreams seem to fall by the side
Like the discarded thought or the day's fading light
But I know that if I could just see you tonight
Forever
At times we may fall, like we all tend to do
But I'll reach out and find that I've run into you
Your strength is the power that carried me through
Forever
Your kindness for weakness I never mistook
I worried you often, yet you understood
That life is so fleeting, these troubles won't last
Forever
Inspired me truly, you did from the start
To not be afraid and to follow my heart
There's a piece of you with me they can't tear apart
Forever
Forever I'll find you, forever we'll be
Forever your power and strength stays with meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah, this one's for the workers who toil night and day
By hand and by brain to earn your pay
Who for centuries long past for no more than your bread
Have bled for your countries and counted your dead


In the factories and mills, in the shipyards and mines
We've often been told to keep up with the times
For our skills are not needed, they've streamlined the job
And with sliderule and stopwatch our pride they have robbed

We're the first ones to starve, we're the first ones to die
The first ones in line for that pie-in-the-sky
And we're always the last when the cream is shared out
For the worker is working when the fat cat's about

And when the sky darkens and the prospect is war
Who's given a gun and then pushed to the fore
And expected to die for the land of our birth
Though we've never owned one lousy handful of earth

And all of these things the worker has done
From tilling the fields to carrying the gun
We've been yoked to the plough since time first began
And always expected to carry the can2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh how do you do, young Willie McBride
Do you mind if I sit here down by your graveside?
And rest for a while in the warm summer sun
I've been walking all day, and I'm nearly done
And I see by your gravestone you were only nineteen
When you joined the great fallen in 1916
Well I hope you died quick, and I hope you died clean
Or Willie McBride, was is it slow and obscene?
Did they beat the drums slowly?
Did they play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band play the last post and chorus?
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest?
And did you leave a wife or a sweetheart behind
In some loyal heart is your memory enshrined?
And though you died back in 1916
To that loyal heart you're forever nineteen
Or are you a stranger without even a name?
Forever enshrined behind some old glass pane
In an old photograph torn, tattered, and stained
And faded to yellow in a brown leather frame
Did they beat the drums slowly?
Did they play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band play the last post and chorus?
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest?
The sun shining down on these green fields of France
The warm wind blows gently and the red poppies dance
The trenches have vanished long under the plow
No gas, no barbed wire, no guns firing now
But here in this graveyard that's still no man's land
The countless white crosses in mute witness stand
To man's blind indifference to his fellow man
And a whole generation were butchered and damned
Did they beat the drums slowly?
Did they play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band play the last post and chorus?
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest?
And I can't help but wonder oh Willie McBride
Do all those who lie here know why they died
Did you really believe them when they told you the cause
Did you really believe that this war would end wars
Well the suffering, the sorrow, the glory, the shame
The killing and dying it was all done in vain
Oh Willie McBride it all happened again
And again, and again, and again, and again
Did they beat the drums slowly?
Did they play the fife lowly?
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down?
Did the band play the last post and chorus?
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Murphy, Murphy, darling dear
I long for you now night and day
Your pain was my pleasure, your sorrow my joy
I feel now I've lost you to health and good cheer
Darcy, when I met you I was five years too young
A boy beyond his age, or so I'd tell someone
Anyone who'd listen and a few who couldn't care
Still I welcomed you with open arms, my love I did share

Darcy, Darcy darling dear
You left me dying, crying there
In whiskey, gin, and pints of beer
I fell for you my darling dear
You shut me off and you showed me the door
But you always came crawling back begging me for more
I showed you kindness, a stool, and a tab
Then you poured me my pain in a dirty glass
(Yeah, you left him bloody, battered, penniless, and poor)
You know, I often stopped and wondered how you made it through my door
With my brother's new non-duplicate registry ID
Well you bit off more than you could chew the first day you met me

You weren't the first to court me mister you won't be the last
Oh, I'm sure I wasn't honey, I know all about your past
Listen to the big shot with his pager on call
You spent most of those nights in my bathroom stall
(Yeah, you got him high, but you left him low)
Mind your own business, boy, how was I to know
That he was just a fiend and a no-good cheat
Well it's all in the past bitch cause now I've got it beat

My dear, my dear
Darcy, Darcy my darling dear1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The season's upon us, it's that time of year
Brandy and eggnog, there's plenty of cheer
There's lights on the trees and there's wreaths to be hung
There's mischief and mayhem and songs to be sung

There's bells and there's holly, the kids are gung-ho
True loves finds a kiss beneath fresh mistletoe
Some families are messed up while others are fine
If you think yours is crazy, well you should see mine
My sisters are wackjobs, I wish I had none
Their husbands are losers and so are their sons
My nephew's a horrible wise little twit
He once gave me a nice gift wrapped box full of shit
He likes to pelt carolers with icy snowballs
I'd like to take him out back and deck more than the halls
With family like this I would have to confess
I'd be better off lonely, distraught and depressed

The season's upon us, it's that time of year
Brandy and eggnog, there's plenty of cheer
There's lights on the trees and there's wreaths to be hung
There's mischief and mayhem and songs to be sung
They call this Christmas where I'm from
My mom likes to cook push our buttons and prod
My brother just brought home another big broad
The eyes rollin' whispers come love from the kitchen
I'd come home more often if they'd only quit bitchin'
Dad on the other hand's a selfish old sod
Drinks whiskey alone with my miserable dog
Who won't run or fetch, yeah he couldn't care less
He defiled my teddy bear and left me the mess

The season's upon us, it's that time of year
Brandy and eggnog, there's plenty of cheer
There's lights on the trees and there's wreaths to be hung
There's mischief and mayhem and songs to be sung
They call this Christmas where I'm from

The table's set, we raise a toast
The father, son, and the Holy Ghost
I'm so glad this day only comes once a year
You can keep your opinions, your presents, your happy new year
They call this Christmas where I'm from
They call this Christmas where I'm from1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

By a lonely prison wall
I heard a young girl calling
"Michael, they have taken you away
For you stole Trevelyan's corn
So the young might see the morn
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay"

Low lie the Fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly
Our love was on the wing
We had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry

By a lonely prison wall
I heard a young man calling
"Nothing matters, Mary, when you're free
Against the Famine and the Crown
I rebelled, they cut me down
Now you must raise our child with dignity"

Low lie the Fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly
Our love was on the wing
We had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry
By a lonely harbor wall
She watched the last star falling
As that prison ship sailed out against the sky
Sure, she'll wait and hope and pray
For her love in Botany Bay
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry

It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry
Low lie the Fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly
Our love was on the wing
We had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of AthenryEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In the town of Milton
One Brian Flannigan battered away till his money was spent
Then he hit a big one and felt like a man again
Bought a three decker with two floors for rent

He threw a big party for friends and relations
At a grand old place called Florian Hall
And if you'll just listen I'll make your eyes glisten
To the rows and the ructions of Flannigan's ball
Six long months I spent in Quincy
Six long months doing nothing at all
Six long months I spent in Quincy
Learning to dance for Flannigan's ball
I stepped out and I stepped in again
I stepped out and I stepped in again
I stepped out and I stepped in again
Learning to dance for Flannigan's ball

Free beer on tap and wine for the ladies
Ziti and sauce for Mark Porzio
There were Faheys and Bradys
Mcauliffes and Dalys courtin the girls and dancing away
Brian Tully sang out in his finest form
The patron's responded and I lead em all
I'd spent 6 months at Forbes Academy
Learning to dance for Flannigan's ball
Six long months I spent in Quincy
Six long months doing nothing at all
Six long months I spent in Quincy
Learning to dance for Flannigan's ball
I stepped out and I stepped in again
I stepped out and I stepped in again
I stepped out and I stepped in again
Learning to dance for Flannigan's ball

The boys were hammered the girls were hearty
Dancing around in couples and groups
An accident happened, young Dennis Flemming
Put his right leg through Miss Finneran's hoops

This gal she fainted and cried bloody murder
Called for her sons and gathered them all
Christopher swore he'd go no further
Till he had revenge at Flannigan's ball
Six long months I spent in Quincy
Six long months doing nothing at all
Six long months I spent in Quincy
Learning to dance for Flannigan's ball
I stepped out and I stepped in again
I stepped out and I stepped in again
I stepped out and I stepped in again
Learning to dance for Flannigan's ball

In the midst of the melee Miss Collins fainted
Her cheeks by now were as red as a rose
Some of the boys declared she was plastered
Had a small drop too much, I suppose

Young Scotty Jenkins so big and able
Saw his fair Colleen stretched by the wall
Tore the left leg from under the table
And smashed all the dishes at Flannigan's ball

Boy oh boy now this was a rumble
Myself took a lick from mean Ricky Green
But I soon replied to that fine introduction
And gave him a terrible kick in the spleen
Talent the piper nearly got strangled
They squeezed on his bellows, chanters and all
The girls in the middle nearly got trampled
And that put an end to Flannigan's ball
Six long months I spent in Quincy
Six long months doing nothing at all
Six long months I spent in Quincy
Learning to dance for Flannigan's ball
I stepped out and I stepped in again
I stepped out and I stepped in again
I stepped out and I stepped in again
Learning to dance for Flannigan's ballEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You’re the fighter
You’ve got the fire
The spirit of a warrior
The champion’s heart
You fight for your life
Because the fighter never quits
You make the most of the hand you’re dealt
Because the quitter never wins
No!

You were born to box in a city that’s seen their share
Mello, Ryan, Carney
Among them your photo proudly hangs there
Above the bar in the Gaelic Club
They tell the story of a throwback
With the heart of a lion
They salute your glory

It’s another murderous night
Another left hook from hell
A bloody war on the boardwalk
And the kid from Lowell rises to the bell
Micky!
It’s a warrior’s code
Micky!
He’s got the warrior’s soul


Micky!
It’s a warrior’s code
Micky!
He’s got the warrior’s soul1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Now let me tell you a story of a big ole' skinhead
On a tragic and fateful day
He put 10 cents in his pocket
Kissed his wife and family
And went to ride on the M.B.T.A
Chorus
Did he ever return
No, he never returned
And his fate is still unknown (Oi, Oi, Oi!)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's a skinhead who never returned
Skinhead goes down to the Kendall Sq. Station
And he changes for Jamaica Plain
The conductor says: "Skinhead I need a nickel,"
Skinhead punches him in the brain
Now all night long skinhead drives through the station
Thinking what can I go and see
Can't afford to buy crack in Chelsea
Or a bundle in Roxbury
Skinhead's wife goes to the scollay square station
Every day about a quarter past two
And through the open window, she throws skinhead a grenade
As the train comes a rumbling through
Now you citizens of Boston
Don't you think its a scandal
How the skinhead stole the train
So what about that fucking skin
You fucking bum
Let me drive that fucking train
Chorus:2xEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Trouble underground in Kenmore Square
You’d better watch out, you’d better beware
It’s time to go, goodbye good luck
They said people like you screw everything up

If you want blood, we’ll give you some
(Blood, blood)
Straight from heart 'til the job is done
If you want it now, then here it comes
(Blood, blood)
If you want blood, we’ll give you some

They beat us down, but we survived
Talked out of school and made up lies
But we don’t listen, we do what we do
We don’t care about them, we care about you

If you want blood, we’ll give you some
(Blood, blood)
Straight from heart 'til the job is done
If you want it now, then here it comes
(Blood, blood)
If you want blood, we’ll give you some
We’re coming for you
We’ll kick down the door
Be careful what you ask for ‘cause you may get more
Gonna keep it loud
We don’t turn down
We’re coming back
We’re taking over this town

If you want blood, we’ll give you some
(Blood, blood)
Straight from heart 'til the job is done
If you want it now, then here it comes
(Blood, blood)
If you want blood, we’ll give you some
Blood, blood
Blood, blood
Blood, blood2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'll tell you a story, believe me it's true
A tale you'd best hope, never happens to you
Old spicy mcHaggis, how he met his fate
You I can save, but for him it's too late
Spicy was big, burly and strong
His pipes were gigantic, and so was his schlong
From city to city running around
Always looking for chicks over four hundred pounds
One night at the pub a girl caught his eye
Big as a house, just the right size
The broad was enormous, stacked to the hilt
Spicy soon noticed a bulge in his kilt
The piper delivered his best pick-up line
Thought to himself, "this beast is all mine"
The portly young lady could stand for no more
Grabbed his cojones and went for the door
They got to her house and dimmed all the lights
Spicy was in for one hell of a night
He said that he loved her, he'd always be true
"But Mr. McHaggis, I've only just met you!!"
By now he saw double through his drunken eyes
Neither had looks or appropriate size
He came to his senses, thought to himself
"At this time of night I won't find nothing else"
He took off his shirt, she lifted her skirt
They pulled out his unit and started to flirt
She asked for a glove, he gave her a shove
Had baby McHaggis nine months to-the-day
SPICY! SPICY! SPICY! SPICY! SPICY! SPICY! SPICY! SPICY!
One night at the pub a girl caught his eye
Big as a house, just the right size
The broad was enormous, stacked to the hilt
Spicy soon noticed a bulge in his kilt
The piper delivered his best pick-up line
Thought to himself, "this beast is all mine"
The portly young lady could stand for no more
Grabbed his cojones and went for the door
Three packs a day, he'll smoke 'til he dies
Spicy McHaggis, one hell of a guy!
I don't know what you all are talking about...and who drank all my beer!?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I had a hat when I came in, I hung it on the rack
I’ll have a hat when I go out
Or I’ll break somebody's back
Casey wore his brand new hat to Murphy’s wake last night
Someone stole my hat boys
It started up a fight
Casey smashed the furniture, the radio as well
I nearly woke the corpse up
When he began to yell
I had a hat when I came in, I hung it on the rack
I’ll have a hat when I go out
Or I’ll break somebody’s back
I’m a peaceful, loving man, I am, and I don’t want to shout                                                                               But I had a hat when I came in, I’ll have a hat when I go out
Casey kept on shouting, boys, they couldn’t keep him quiet
Someone phoned the cops up to come and stop the riot
Two cops rushed into the room, but Casey laid them out
I fired ‘em through the window
They both heard Casey shout
I had a hat when I came in, I hung it on the rack
I’ll have a hat when I go out
Or I’ll break somebody’s back
I’m a peaceful, loving man, I am, and I don’t want to shout                                                                               But I had a hat when I came in, I’ll have a hat when I go out
I’m a peaceful loving man, I am, and I don’t want to shout, but I had a hat when I came in
I’ll have a hat when I go out
Casey kept on shouting, boys, till One-eyed Paddy Flynn
Socked me in the whiskers with a great big rolling pin
It knocked poor Casey senseless
It was an awful clout
As he lay there unconscious, Casey shouted out
I had a hat when I came in, I hung it on the rack
I’ll have a hat when I go out
Or I’ll break somebody’s back
I’m a peaceful, loving man, I am, and I don’t want to shout                                                                               But I had a hat when I came in, I’ll have a hat when I go out
I’m a peaceful, loving man, I am
(I had a hat when I came in, I hung it on the rack I’ll have a hat when I go out
I had a hat when I came in, I hung it on the rack I’ll have a hat when I go out
Or I’ll break somebody’s back)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
