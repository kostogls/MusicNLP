We say "No, not in our name."

It's in the things that you say and you don't say
You don't know it 'cause you're such a fuckin' cliche
The way you define them and us
Those you fear and those you trust
You know a black guy and he's very articulate
You know a Mexican and she's honest and diligent
You don't see color, but some people need discipline
A thug is a thug, some people need to learn a lesson

Your justifications (one dead giveaway)
Your qualifications (one dead giveaway)
You'd never endorse the Jim Crow days
But the malice in your voice is a god damn giveaway

Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
A bigot with a checklist
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
You don't get a pass when you're talkin' your shit
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
A bigot with a checklist
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
You don't get a pass, get a pass for your ignorance
Black lives matter and you don't know why
And reverse racism isn't a real thing
No you weren't alive in the time of slavery
But that's no excuse to ignore its legacy
Not afraid of refugees
But don't want a mosque built on your street
Offended by the claim of bigotry
More than the racism in your face

Your justifications (one dead giveaway)
Your qualifications (one dead giveaway)
You'd never endorse the Bull Connor days
But the malice in your voice is a god damn giveaway

Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
A bigot with a checklist
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
You don't get a pass when you're talkin' your shit
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
A bigot with a checklist
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
You don't get a pass, get a pass for your ignorance
You fly the flag of the Confederacy
You say to celebrate your history
The South was fighting to save slavery
To preserve and protect white supremacy

Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
A bigot with a checklist
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist
You don't get a pass when you're talkin' your shit
Just 'cause you don't know you're racist

The memo says
We gotta work to make the facts fit the false charges
Pull the wool over the eyes of the filthy masses
Stab the people in the back for the corporate choice
Roll the propaganda out using The People's Voice
We don't want to talk about it...

The press scribble scribble every half-truth spoke
Then shoot it round the country like an April Fool's joke
Hype the nation for a Desert Storm love affair
Wave the stars and stripes like you just don't care!

They talk it up all day, they talk it up all night
They talk until their face turns blue - Red white and blue!
But when the truth escapes the night and crawls into the day
We find the picture still askew

They don't want to... talk talk talk talk talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
Woah, woah
They don't want to talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and cowardly salute
And on the TV screen...
...Diversion and aversion is the flavor of the day
Was it WMDs? Or Democracy?
Blame it on MI-6 or the CIA
The White House Press Corpse only has one thing to say...
"We don't want to talk about it!"

The White House boils over, "Al Jazeera got it wrong!"
The Press Corpse jumps onboard singing the White House song
While over in Iraq thousands are dead because of lies
The spineless war drumming-press corpse have taken lives

They talk it up all day, they talk it up all night
They talk until their face turns blue - Red white and blue!
But when the truth escapes the night and crawls into the day
We find the picture still askew

They don't want to... talk talk talk talk talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
Woah, woah
They don't want to talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and cowardly salute
Fires fueled on endless lies
Black shrouds coat desert skies
A nation's viewpoint blurred and led
As embeds report what they're fed
We don't want to talk about it...
We don't want to talk about it...
We don't want to talk about it...
We don't want to talk about it...
(We don't want to talk about it...)
We don't, don't want to, we don't wanna talk about it
(We don't want to...)
We don't, don't want to, we don't wanna talk

They don't want to... talk talk talk talk talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and cowardly salute
Woah, woah
They don't want to talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it

Yeah

There's no escaping the American attraction
A bait and switch that's gonna thrill you with distraction
It sounds so good you can't resist the satisfaction
When it's all over you'll be crying, they'll be laughing, yeah

I got everything you want
Got that bomb, got that blood
I got everything you're not
It's the American attraction

The clock tick-tick-tick-ticking down to a disaster
Your insecurity is all they're gunnin' after

Where ideology replaces being honest

Got that bomb, got that blood

Seems every station on the TV
Is selling something no one can be
If every page was torn from the magazine
Would cash still drive the media machine?
The products, damage, and pursuit are endless
Identity can leave you selfless

We will not witness this anymore
This is the end for you, my friend
I can't forgive, I won't forget
On and on, we sing our songs and
On and on, the wars wage on and
On and on, we sing our songs for more
For more

Your eyes are open but you can't see
Your mouth is moving but you don't speak
A blitzkrieg of images to break your will
I hope you choke on every pill

If they come for you in the night

Look outside your window, there's a woman being grabbed
They've voted with their reverence and a bible in their hand
Maybe we should go outside and try to stop her pain
But the anthem's started playing and I'd hate to miss the game
Sweating in the ghetto with the panthers and the poor
The rich will do it all for you but help you off the floor
Wouldn't their hope become a riot if the dream wasn't a rot
They've got their welfare pennies and besides we've got the cops

If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning
If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning

Now there's a dirty paper using sex to make a sale
They're all surprised the turnout and the outcomes were a fail
Maybe we can help their pain and speak the truth online
But we're busy reading Playboy and the Sunday New York Times
If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning
If they come for you in the night
They will come for me in the morning
Well you're safe now in the fire light

Unless you pay the price (the price)
Your hope, freedom, your sanity (sanity)

These are the days that test your heart and soul
Strap yourself in for the American fall
Day after day it is all crash and burn
A nation hijacked by the criminals
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Your neighbor is your enemy
Your real friends are on the TV
They’re selling lies and self-loathing
Nothing no one should pay to be
The cost of healthcare, cost of guns
The cost of knowledge, cost of love
When prison is an industry
Somebody’s getting locked away
Uninvited to the party
They're cold, afraid, and starving
There's gotta be more
To the millions who are marching
Than a separation of just a few degrees
Between evil, famine, and the disease

These are the days that test your heart and soul
Strap yourself in for the American fall
Day after day it is all crash and burn

I lost my baby to a foreign war
She was cut down in the gunfire of the western world

She was livin' in sin, I was livin' in a lie
She was caught up in the glimmer of a rich man's eye
I couldn't see her from the other side
They said son, "There is no glory in your pride."

I will wait at the Brandenburg Gate;
At the Brandenburg Gate, I'll wait
I will wait at the Brandenburg Gate;
At the Brandenburg Gate I'll wait, I'll wait

Well, I lost my baby to a foreign war
She was cut down in the gunfire of the western world

She was searching for salvation in the things you buy
I was finding all the reason to give up on life
If you love something and give it away
It can't come back unless you're free
I will wait at the Brandenburg Gate
At the Brandenburg Gate I'll wait
I will wait at the Brandenburg Gate
At the Brandenburg Gate I'll wait
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait

Somewhere in the in between
Where the east and the west meet
In the 30 year war where I came clean
That's where you will find me
So I'll wait, I'll wait

Verse 1:
Everybody just wants to fucking breathe
Nobody can, and everyone believes
We will just breathe later and they won't die
But truthfully they were never alive
To question the society you live in
You gotta call yourself in question
To question the answers you're given
You gotta call yourself in question
Chorus:
Because a cop lives inside of all our heads
We're gonna kill him dead, we're gonna finish what we started
A boss lives inside of all our heads
We're gonna kill him dead, we're gonna finish what we started
Verse 2:
We don't need a world where a guarantee
A starvation death, impossibility
In every home a new car, a new TV
Bringing the risk of dying of boredom
To question the society you live in
You gotta call yourself in question
To question the answers you're given
You gotta call yourself in question
Chorus:
Because a cop lives inside of all our heads
We're gonna kill him dead, we're gonna finish what we started
A boss lives inside of all our heads
We're gonna kill him dead, we're gonna finish what we started
Because a cop lives inside of all our heads
We're gonna kill him dead, we're gonna finish what we started
A boss lives inside of all our heads
We're gonna kill him dead, we're gonna finish what we started
We're gonna finish what we started
We're gonna finish what we started
Outro:
Only hope comes from the hopeless
Only soul comes from the soulless
Chorus:
Because a cop lives inside of all our heads

We're gonna kill him dead, we're gonna finish what we started

Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin’ the life

Wake up wondering: “How’ did I get here?”
Then cross my heart and say a fuckin’ prayer
Ecstasy, tears, bravery, fears
This boat may float, but it don’t steer

Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin’ the life
Life’s long and winding roads leading us
To a never ending trail to keep our youth
It flashes by in lessons painfully attained
Blood and sweat, black and blue
Some surrender I got nothing to surrender to

Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin’ the life
So now you’re livin’
So now you’re livin’
Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin’ the life

Close my eyes try to make it last
Outrun the wretched memories of my pastEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

10 easy steps to create an enemy and start a war:
Listen closely because we will all see this weapon used in our lives
It can be used on a society of the most ignorant to the most highly educated
We need to see these tactics as a weapon against humanity and not as truth
THIS IS HOW TO CREATE AN ENEMY! THIS IS HOW TO START A WAR!
THIS IS HOW TO CREATE AN ENEMY!
First step: create the enemy. Sometimes this will be done for you
Second step: be sure the enemy you have chosen is nothing like you
Find obvious differences like race, language, religion, dietary habits
Fashion. Emphasize that their soldiers are not doing a job
They are heartless murderers who enjoy killing!
Third step: Once these differences are established continue to reinforce them with all disseminated information
Fourth step: Have the media broadcast only the ruling party's information
This can be done through state run media
Remember, in times of conflict all for-profit media repeats the ruling party's information, therefore all for-profit media is state-run
Fifth step: show this enemy in actions that seem strange, militant, or different
Always portray the enemy as non-human, evil, a killing machine
THIS IS HOW TO CREATE AN ENEMY. THIS IS HOW TO START A WAR
THIS IS HOW TO CREATE AN ENEMY
Sixth step: Eliminate opposition to the ruling party
Create an "Us versus Them" mentality. Leave no room for opinions in between
One that does not support all actions of the ruling party should be considered a traitor
Seventh step: Use nationalistic and/or religious symbols and rhetoric to define all actions
This can be achieved by slogans such as "freedom loving people versus those who hate freedom."
This can also be achieved by the use of flags
Eighth step: Align all actions with the dominant deity
It is very effective to use terms like, "It is god's will" or "god bless our nation."
Ninth step: Design propaganda to show that your soldiers
Have feelings, hopes, families, and loved ones
Make it clear that your soldiers are doing a duty; they do not want or like to kill
Tenth step: Create and atmosphere of fear, and instability
Then offer the ruling party as the only solutions to comfort the public's fears
Remembering the fear of the unknown is always the strongest fear
THIS IS HOW TO CREATE AN ENEMY! THIS IS HOW TO START A WAR!
THIS IS HOW TO CREATE AN ENEMY!

The bottom floor of a cold building
Promised a career and a diamond ring
Glass ceiling above, nothing under her feet
"Honey, just give me a smile, how hard can that be?"

Life at 26 ain't what she thought it would be
Now she’s waking up from an American dream

No rain falls to a spoiled land
Who is un-American, un-American?
No peace comes from a greedy hand
Who is un-American, un-American?

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

Factory floor that they told him would stay
Another line sold on another campaign
The churches decay by his grandparents' grave
A town exchanged for the money they saved
Life at 36 ain't what he thought it would be
Now he’s waking up from an American dream

No rain falls to a spoiled land
Who is un-American, un-American?
No peace comes from a greedy hand
Who is un-American, un-American?

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

Apartment floor to the stadium
The roar of the crowd and the marching drums
All his life they taught him how to run
Shot in the back, the jury was the gun

No rain falls to a spoiled land
Who is un-American, un-American?
No peace comes from a greedy hand
Who is un-American, un-American?
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
