If I ever leave this world alive
I'll thank ya for the things you did in my life
If I ever leave this world alive
I'll come back down and sit beside your feet tonight
Wherever I am you'll always be
More than just a memory
If I ever leave this world alive

If I ever leave this world alive
I'll take on all the sadness
That I left behind
If I ever leave this world alive
The madness that you feel will soon subside
So in a word, don't shed a tear
I'll be here when it all gets weird
If I ever leave this world alive

So when in doubt just call my name
Just before you go insane
If I ever leave this world
Hey I may never leave this world
But if I ever leave this world alive
She says I'm okay, I'm alright
Though you have gone from my life
You said that it would
Now everything should be all right7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Must it take a life for hateful eyes
To glisten once again
Five hundred years like gelignite
Have blown us all to hell
What savior rests while on his cross we die
Forgotten freedom burns
Has the Shepherd led his lambs astray
To the bigot and the gun

Must it take a life for hateful eyes
To glisten once again
Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies

I watch and stare as Roisin's eyes
Turn a darker shade of red
And the bullet with this sniper lie
In their bloody gutless cell
Must we starve on crumbs from long ago
Through bars these men made steel
Is it a great or little thing we fought
Knelt the conscience blessed to kill
Must it take a life for hateful eyes
To glisten once again
Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies

Ah, but maybe it's the way we were taught
Or maybe it`s the way we thought
But a smile never grins without tears to begin
For each kiss is a cry we all lost
Though nothing is left to gain
But for the banshee that stole the grave
Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies

I sit in and dwell on faces past
Like memories seem to fade
No color left, but black and white
And soon we'll all turn grey
But may these shadows rise to walk again
With lessons truly learnt
When the blossom flowers in each our hearts
Shall beat a new found flame
Must it take a life for hateful eyes
To glisten once again
Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

His eyes they closed
And his last breath spoke
He had seen all to be seen
A life once full, now an empty vase
Wilt the blossoms on his early grave

Walk away me boy
Walk away me boy
And by morning we'll be free
Wipe that golden tear
From your mother dear
And raise what's left
Of the flag for me

Then the rosary beads
Count them 1, 2, 3
Fell apart as they hit the floor
In a garb of black
We must pay respect
To the color we're born to mourn

Walk away me boys
Walk away me boys
By morning we'll be free
Wipe that golden tear
From your mother dear
And raise what's left
Of the flag for me
In it's place there grew an angry festered wound
Filled with hatred and remorse
Where I pick and scratched, 'til the blood it matched
The silent rage now that fills my lungs
For there are many ways to kill a man, they say
With bayonet, axe or sword
But son, a bullet fired from a shapeless guise
Just put the shell of a Thompson gun

Walk away me boys
Walk away me boys
And by morning we'll be free
Wipe that golden tear
From your mother dear
And raise what's left
Of the flag for me

From the east out to the western shore
Where many men and many more will fall
But no angel flies with me tonight
Though freedom reigns on all
And curse the name for which we slaved our days
So every men chose kingdom come
But sure as night turns day
It's the passion play
Oh my god, what have they done
With madman's rage
Well, they dug our graves
But the dead rise again you fools

Walk away me boys
Walk away me boys
And by morning we'll be free
Wipe that golden tear
From your mother dear
And raise what's left
Of the flag for me
Walk away me boys
Walk away me boys
And by morning we'll be free
Wipe that golden tear
From your mother dear
And raise what's left
Of the flag for meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Her breath began to speak
As she stood right in front of me
The colour of her eyes
Were the colour of insanity
Crushed beneath her wave
Like a ship, I could not reach the shore
We're all just dancers on the Devil's Dance Floor
Well swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o
Swing a little more, little more next to me
Swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o
Swing a little more, on the Devil's Dance Floor
Pressed against her face
I could feel her insecurity
Mother'd been a drunk
And her father was obscurity
Nothin' ever came
From a life that was a simple one
Pull yourself together girl
And have a little fun
Well she took me by the hand
I could see she was a fiery one
Her legs ran all the way
Up to heaven and past Avalon
Tell me somethin' girl, what it is you have in store
She said come with me now
On the Devil's Dance Floor
Well swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o
Swing a little more, little more next to me
Swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o
Swing a little more, on the Devil's Dance Floor
Swing a little more, on the Devil's Dance Floor
Swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o
Swing a little more, little more next to me
Swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o
Swing a little more, on the Devil's Dance Floor!
The apple now is sweet
Oh much sweeter than it ought to be
Another little bite
I don't think there is much hope for me
The sweat beneath her brow
Travels all the way
An' headin' south
This bleedin' heart's cryin'
Cause there's no way out
Well swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o
Swing a little more, little more next to me
Swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o
Swing a little more, on the Devil's Dance Floor
Swing a little more! little more o'er the merry-o!
Swing a little more! little more next to me!
Swing a little more! little more o'er the merry-o!
Swing a little more, on the Devil's Dance Floor

Drank away the rest of the day, I wonder what my liver'd say
Drink, that's all you can
Blackened days with their bigger gales blow in your parlor to discuss the day
Listen, that's all you can
Oh, but don't, no, don't sink the boat
That you built, you built to keep afloat
No, don't, don't sink the boat
That you built
Sick and tired of what to say, no one listens anyway
Sing, that's all you can
Rambling years of lousy luck, you miss the smell of burning turf
Dream, that's all you can
Oh, but don't, no, don't sink the boat
That you built, you built to keep afloat
No, don't, don't sink the boat
That you built, that you built to keep afloat
Singled out for who you are, it takes all types to judge a man
Feel, that's all you can
Filthy suits with bigot ears hide behind their own worst fears
Live, that's all you can
It's all you can
It's all you can do
No matter where I put my head, I'll wake up feeling sound again
Breathe, that's all you can
Tomorrow smells of less decay, the flowers greet this blooming fray
Be thankful, that's all you can
Oh, but don't, no, don't sink the boat
That you built, you built to keep afloat
No, don't, no, don't sink the boat
That you built, that you built to keep afloat
No, don't, no, don't sink the boat
That you built, that you built to keep afloat
A ripe old age, a ripe old age
I'm a ripe old age, that's what I am
I'm a ripe old age, a ripe old age
A ripe old age, just doing the best I can
A ripe old age, a ripe old age
A ripe old age, that's what I am
A ripe old age, a ripe old age

All to hell, we must sail for the shores of sweet Barbados
Where the sugar cane grows taller than the god we once believed in
The butcher and his crown raped the land we used to sleep in
Now tomorrow chimes of ghostly crimes that haunt Tobacco Island
'Twas 1659 forgotten now for sure
They dragged us from our homeland with the musket and their gun
Cromwell and his roundheads battered all we knew
Shackled hopes of freedom, we're naught but stolen goods
Dark is the horizon
Blackened from the sun
This rotten cage of Bridgetown
Is where I now belong
All to hell, we must sail for the shores of sweet Barbados
Where the sugar cane grows taller than the god we once believed in
The butcher and his crown raped the land we used to sleep in
Now tomorrow chimes of ghostly crimes that haunt Tobacco Island
Red leg, down a peg, blistered burns the soul
The floggings they're a plenty but reasons there are none
Our backs belong to landlords, where branded is there name
Paid for with ten shillings, cheap labor never breaks
The silver moon is shining
Cools the copper blood
Where the living meet the dead
And together dance as one
All to hell, we must sail for the shores of sweet Barbados
Where the sugar cane grows taller than the god we once believed in
The butcher and his crown raped the land we used to sleep in
Now tomorrow chimes of ghostly crimes that haunt Tobacco Island
Agony, will you cleanse this misery?
For it's never again I'll breathe the air of home
From this sandy edge, the rolling sea breaks my revenge
With each whisper a thousand waves, I hear roar
I'm coming home
Dark is the horizon
Blackened by the sun
This rotten cage of Bridgetown
Is where I now belong
All to hell, we must sail for the shores of sweet Barbados
Where the sugar cane grows taller than the god we once believed in
The butcher and his crown raped the land we used to sleep in
Now tomorrow chimes of ghostly crimes that haunt Tobacco Island

Well, I know I miss more than hit
With a face that was launched to sink
And I seldom feel the bright relief
It's been the worst day since yesterday
If there's one thing I have said
It's that the dreams I once had now lay in bed
As the four winds blow my wits through the door
It's been the worst day since yesterday
Falling down to you, sweet ground
Where the flowers they bloom, well, it's there I'll be found
Hurry back to me, my wild colleen
It's been the worst day since yesterday
Though these wounds have seen no wars
Except for the scars I have ignored
And this endless crutch, well, it's never enough
It's been the worst day since yesterday
Hell says hello, well, it's time I should go
To pastures green that I've yet to see
Hurry back to me, my wild colleen
It's been the worst day since yesterday

Now I'm aiming for Heaven
But probably wind up down in Hell
Where, upon this altar
I will hang my guilt-ridden head
But it's time I'll take, before I begin
Three sheets to the wind, three sheets to the wind
Yeah, it's time I'll take, before I begin
Three sheets to the wind, three sheets to the wind

Rebels are we
Though heavy our hearts shall always be
And no ball or chain, no prison shall keep
We're the rebels of the sacred heart
I said, no ball or chain, no prison shall keep
We're the rebels of the sacred heart

Terrified of the open road
Yeah, where it leads, you never know
But rest assured, he'll be on you back
Yeah, the Holy Ghost through his tongues in black
As the band dog howls and the young girl cries
The blessed virgin in her proud dad's eye
The albatross hangin' round your neck
Is the cross you bear for your sins he bleeds
Rebels are we
Though heavy our hearts shall always be
And no ball or chain no prison shall keep
We're the rebels of the sacred heart
I said no ball or chain no prison shall keep
We're the rebels of the sacred heart

Genuflect all you refugees who fled the land
Now on guilt you kneel
And say a prayer for those left behind
From beyond the pale, to the northern sky
So you saved your shillings and your last six pence
Cause in God's name they built a barbed wire fence
Be glad you sailed for a better day
But don't forget, there'll be hell to pay

Rebels are we
Though heavy our hearts shall always be
And no ball or chain no prison shall keep
We're the rebels of the sacred heart
I said no ball or chain no prison shall keep
We're the rebels of the sacred heart
Resurrection, no protection, all things life must be
And no ball or chain no prison shall keep
We`re the rebels of the sacred heart

Now bless me father for I have sinned
But it's the same old story again, and again, and again
Ah well, such is the bread of an everyday life
From mornin' to noon to the shadowless night
Ah well, such is the bread of an everyday life
From mornin' to noon to the shadowless night

I want to believe in myself once again
So I dream of a man whose hopes never end
To kiss with a girl who's as lovely as you
I'd give you my heart if you gave me the truth
And for every tear that is lost from an eye
I'd dig me a well where no man could destroy
I want to believe in a freedom that's bold
But all I remember is the freedom of old
Hey!
Well, I lost me a wife so I found me a plane
Flew all the way to California
This mess in my head is a mess getting out
You drink too much coffee, I drink too much stout
But after a while, when my mouth ain't so dry
I'll dance up a storm, sure life's looking fine
But as darkness falls, I return to my bed
Don't ask me more questions, don't fuck with my head
Cause I've been down in this world, down and almost broken
Like thousands of people, left standing in their shoe
Down in this world, down and almost broken
As thousands they grieve as the black Friday rule
As thousands they grieve as the black Friday rule
As thousands they grieve as the black Friday rule
As thousands they grieve as the black Friday rule
The buildings, they shake, but my heart, it beats still
Oh, mother of Jesus, I feel pretty ill
I want to go home where my feet both feel safe
But there ain't no jobs in the old free state
So I must remain in my new adopted land
I'm doing the best, hell I'm doing all I can
So next time you see me, don't ask for my name
For I am the king and shall long may I reign
Cause I've been down in this world, down and almost broken
Like thousands of people left standing in their shoe
Down in this world, down and almost broken
As thousands they grieve as the black Friday rule
Cause I've been down in this world, down and almost broken
Like thousands of people left standing in their shoe

Sail away where no ball and chain
Can keep us from the roarin' waves
Together undivided but forever we'll be free
Said sail away aboard our rig
The moon is full and so are we
Seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins
So the years rolled by and several died
And left us somewhat reelin'
Johnny strummed his Tommy gun
Left blastin' through the ceiling
What became of rebels
Who sang for you and me?
Grapplin' with their demons
In the search for liberty
Sufferers who suffer all
Can swim upon the desert
Avarice have ravaged all
In spite of good intentions
Don't fill your mouth with gluttony
For pride will surely swell
But nothing's unforgiven in the four corners of hell
So sail away where no ball and chain
Can keep us from the roarin' waves
Together undivided but forever we'll be free
Sail away aboard our rig
The moon is full and so are we
Seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins
Seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins
Envy and its evil twin
It crept in bed with slander
Idiots they gave advice
But sloth it gave no answer
Anger kills the human soul
With bitter tales of lust
Like Pavlov's dogs keep chewin'
On the legs they never trust
Sail away where no ball and chain
Can keep us from the roarin' waves
Together undivided but forever we'll be free
Sail away aboard our rig
The moon is full and so are we
Seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins
We're seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins (Yargh!)
(Haha!)
But it's the only life we'll know
Blaggards to the bone
So don't wreck yourself
Take an honest grip
For there's more tales beyond the shore
Ah the years rolled by and several died
And left us somewhat reelin'
In and out came crawlin' out
And spewed upon the ceiling
What became of rebels
That sang for you and me?
Grapplin' with their demons
In the search for liberty
Sail away where no ball and chain
Can keep us from the roarin' waves
Together undivided but forever we'll be free
So sail away aboard our rig
The moon is full and so are we
Seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins
Sail away where no ball and chain

I'll wait for you till I turn blue
There's nothin' more a man can do
Don't get your bollocks in a twist
Settle down, don't take a fit
You drank with demons straight form Hell
They almost nearly won as well
You wiped the floor with victory
Then puked until you fell asleep
Blackened was the banshee's wail
These boots will never fill her jail
So you crawled into an empty boat
For the Gulf of Mexico
Till Cortez came an' when so did you
From the ashes charred and blue
Smellin' like a Salty Dog
Back from Hell where you belong
Anarchy, the scourge of every sea
The Antichrist aboard a rig
With us your cutthroat thieves
The ship went down we all near drowned
Ya stood there on the deck
Till the Spanish came and flogged yer arse
And dragged you from the wreck
They threw a rope around yer neck
To watch you dance the jig of death
Then left ya for the starvin' crows
Hoverin' like hungry whores
One flew down plucked out yer eye
The other he had in his sights
Ya snarled at him, said leave me be
I need the bugger so I can seeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Dear Majesty,
I kneel at your feet
Though my heart, it tells me, I am wrong
For I am my own man and these are my needs
And without them your sovereign will be lost
I remember the day I earned my first pay
Belittled and ground to a halt
I rose with the flames from my father’s remains
I buried when I was a pup
Here we are now,
Here we are now
The Devil has spoke and he’s not very bright
Here we are now,
Here we are now
Take me away and deliver what’s right
Here we are now
Here we are now
The Devil has spoke and he’s not very bright
Here we are now
Here we are now
The Devil has spoke
And he’s not
Very bright
Dear Constantine,
Come make me believe
In your Lord, I have chose to ignore
For mine is the year
I now listen to here
So I taunt every tyrant with a fault
For never’s a Twain, I know that I’ll remain
Come gather what’s left of the cause
And together we’ll march
On the backs of the damned
And rise from beneath one and all
Here we are now,
Here we are now
The Devil has spoke and he’s not very bright
Here we are now,
Here we are now
Take me away and deliver what’s right
Here we are now
Here we are now
The Devil has spoke and he’s not very bright
Here we are now
Here we are now
The Devil has spoke
Here we are now1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I saw her there fade from afar
Her hair grey charcoal
Takes a drag from her tar
I kissed her a smile
But her blood red shot eye
Said the sun never shines on closed doors

It's been eight long years since I saw
The woman who's labored
Since the day I was born
These wrinkles now face
To that cold dark damp place
Where the sun never shines on closed doors

She said the sun never shines on closed doors
I open to find only hurricanes blow
Take me away, to the green fields of May
Because the sun never shines on closed doors

Death comes like a thief in the night
To steal while you sleep
The soul's flickering light
Well maybe it's then
She said, I'll see you again
Cause the sun never shines on closed doors

And we all go the same way home
Yeah, we all go the same way home2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, I worked on the railroad
For twopence a day
I drank down one penny
The other I'd save
I hammered and I hammered
For God knows how long
Well into madness
With each setting sun
I put my head down
And I dreamt you were here
With me by the old tree
Where no one could care
Far away, boys, far away, boys
Away from you now
I'm lying with my sweetheart
In her arms I'll be found
Then the sun belched upon me
You were no longer here
Lying in your place was
My hammer and my gear
So I stamped out the fire
That kept us both warm
The ashes were falling
Like the snowdrops of old
We came to a mountain
Dynamite and she'll blow
A big hole in that rock
Like the one in my soul
We buried four workmen
They dug themselves well
From four empty coffins
To four early graves
They're only paddys, just paddys
Don't dig them too deep
You'll need all your strength, boys
They're replaced easily
With the heat I was melting
Into your sweet lips
Ah, your kiss takes me back
Takes me back from all this
Far away, boys, far away, boys
Away from you now
I'm lying with my sweetheart
In her arms I'll be found
Someone said it was Christmas
Not a tree was in sight
The only thing growing
Was my will to die
Till the gaffer said, men
Your work here is done
Said I'll see you in hell
On that train we died for
Never again
Will I smell your sweet dream
But a piss-stained old gutter
Where your lips used to be
Far away, boys, far away, boys
Away from you now
I'm lying with my sweetheart
In her arms I'll be found
Far away, boys, far away, boys
Away from you now
I'm lying with my sweetheart
In her arms I'll be foundEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She said make this pain, disappear
And lead me to this life
You one day fear
Don't make me belong
Where I don't belong
Let's us suffer in this silence I can't hear
Ooooh, but if I could walk across the ocean
To be beside you when you sleep
Swim the cold Atlantic water
Just to hold you next to me
Life is good, life is good
Life is fine, life is fine
Life is everything we loathe, it's so unkind
They say death is cruel, death is cruel
But death unwinds, death unwinds
It comes naturally to all us here alive
She said take these words, sing along
For we beggars can't be choosers very long
Come to me here, whisper in your ear
Enjoy yourselves, I know I surely did
Ooooh, but if I could walk across the ocean
Find ourselves a little peace
Where all of our troubles are forgotten
And wars will someday cease
Life is good, life is good
Life is fine, life is fine
Life is everything we loathe it's so unkind
They say death is cruel, death is cruel
But death unwinds, death unwinds

Raised on songs and stories, heroes of renown
The passing tales and glories that once was Dublin Town
The hallowed halls and houses, the haunting children's rhymes
That once was part of Dublin, in the rare ould times

Ring a ring a rosey
As the light declines
I remember Dublin City
In the rare ould times

Well, me name, it is Sean Dempsey
As Dublin as can be
Born hard and late in Pimlico
In a house that ceased to be
My trade, I was a cooper
Lost out to redundancy
Like my house that fell to progress
My trade's a memory

Well, I courted Peggy Dignam
As pretty as you please
A rogue child of Mary
From the rebel liberties
I lost her to a student chap
With skin as black as coal
When he took her off to Birmingham
Well, she took away my soul

Well, the years have made me bitter
The gargle dims me brain
Cause Dublin keeps on changing
And nothing seems the same
The Pillar and the Met have gone
The Royal long since pulled down
As the grey, unyielding concrete
Makes a city of my town


Fare thee well, sweet Anna Liffey
I can no longer stay
And watch the new glass cages
That spring up along the quay
My mind's too full of memories
Too old to hear new chimes
I'm part of what was Dublin
In the rare ould times

Home boys, I'm going home
Saw in you a scorching light
That terrified these bones into this life
A single blow, I kissed the floor
Never to regain what I had known
Then came the tears and many more
Oh but little blossoms, little blossoms fall

I'm going home boys, I'm going home
Where you and I, we took our chances
Through the fields of failed romances
Terrified that all is over
But you and I, and we will rise again
But I'm going home, I'm going home

I craved it all, a pure desire
Always wanting more than I required
When its the same old song, show me the door
But every drop I bleed, you still want more
I won't take too long, I'll leave standing tall
Ah, as little blossoms, little blossoms fall

I'm going home boys, I'm going home
Where you and I, we took our chances
Through the fields of failed romances
Terrified that all is over
But you and I, and we will rise again

Oh but little blossoms, little blossoms fall

Death valley queen, where have you been?
Since they crowned you in glory, filled your head with dreams
But it still goes to show, in every desert there's a rose
That's blooming for all to be seen
I remember you well from that town you did dwell
With the face of an angel in a dump hot as hell
When I asked for a kiss, you kindly dismissed
So I lead my poor heart to the slaughter
Tell me dear, what did you fear?
I'd do you no wrong, though no stranger to sin
So death valley queen, go marry your king
Or an old maid you'll end up for certain
Off I did set on my trail of regret
Where I thought of you now in your castle and crown
So I found me a whore with a face just like yours
After several gallons of porter
When I awoke, she had scarpered, I was broke
Laying cold in the bed with a whale for a head
So death valley queen, go marry your king
Or an old maid you'll end up for certain
Then the ball dropped
While everything fell by the way
As your teardrops
Were falling I forgot to say
That I have always loved you
Yeah I have always loved you
Yeah I
Yeah I
I have always loved you
When I returned, downtrodden and burned
There were billy goats grazing where once you'd be found
So I hung out to dry on this limb for a lie
Take me back for I'm cursed on the mainland
Tell me dear, what did you fear?
I'd do you no wrong though no stranger to sin
So death valley queen, go marry your king
Or an old maid you'll end up for certain
I said death valley queen, go marry your king
And a-roving I'll end up for certainEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Sweeping me back, back here to stay
Can winners be losers, running on the same track?
While some head for glory, others we crash
Well, it breaks my heart to see you this way
The beauty in life, where's it gone?
And somebody told me you were doing okay
Somehow I guess they were wrong
My isolation, now there's a sobering thought
A minute alone, a lifetime too long
See the face in this mirror, so pale it could crack
Desperately wanting the color it lacks
Well, it breaks my heart to see you this way
The beauty in life, where's it gone?
And somebody told me you were doing okay
Somehow I guess they were wrong
So you drank with the lost souls for too many years
Tied to their ankles, now crippled with fear
Never been righteous though seldom were wrong
Life's only life with you in this song
Now there's an ocean between
Where I am and where I want to be
So you prayers in doubt
Doubt not for me
Well, it breaks my heart to see you this way
The beauty in life, where's it gone?
And somebody told me you were doing okay
Somehow I guess they were wrong
Well, it breaks my heart to see you this way
The beauty in life, where's it gone?
And somebody told me you were doing okay
Somehow I guess they were wrong
Whistles the wind
Whistles the wind
Whistles the wind
Whistles the wind
Though you'll find your way out, but there's no going now
Every woman and child drags you down for the dive
It's not safe being free, can't give back what you feel
He said you'll always be in heaven with meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
***
Said her name was Marie from the banks of the Lee
With the prettiest eyes my own's ever seen
Her hair like ripples, they danced with the tide
As our hearts washed away to the sea
Was she sent down to me from the heavens above?
Her breath pure as whiskey, my heart fell in love
Now the devil is courting a different tune
And I laugh as these tears wash the rain
Tell me why no one's listening
Is there nothing at all left to say
In a world so unforgiving
You mean more to me each every day
So may the living be dead in our wake
One cold winter's night behind the clouds stars did hide
And the ghost of our souls thanking Christ we're alive
Our spirits they crackled with lovers' first sight
Till the morning came fresh with a new
Will you dance with me now, heavens child, sang the clown
We've nothing to lose but your wings and my frown
Where over the hills and the valleys will ring
To the sound of our love singing true
Tell me why no one's listening
Is there nothing at all left to say
In a world so unforgiving
You mean more to me each every day
So may the living be dead in our wake
But the summer sun is melting now, with the leaves I'll soon be gone
Will you have the strength when the emptiness shadows fall?
Or will your aching heart be ripped apart by the beating from the storm?
Or will howling gales like yesterdays be gone?
Was she sent down to me from the heavens above?
Her breath pure as whiskey, my heart fell in love
Now the devil is courting a different tune
And I laugh as these tears wash the rain
Tell me why no one's listening
Is there nothing at all left to say
In a world so unforgiving
You mean more to me each every day
So may the living be dead in our wakeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
