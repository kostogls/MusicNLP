Potential H-bomb
God save the queen

And our figurehead
Is not what she seems
Oh, God save history
God save your mad parade
Oh, Lord, God have mercy
All crimes are paid
When there's no future how can there be sin?
We're the flowers in the dustbin
We're the poison in your human machine

Right now, heh heh heh heh

I am an Antichrist
I am an anarchist
Don't know what I want but I know how to get it
I wanna destroy the passersby

'Cause I, I wanna be anarchy!
No dogsbody!

Anarchy for the U.K. it's coming sometime and maybe
I give a wrong time, stop a traffic line
Your future dream is a shopping scheme

'Cause I, I wanna be anarchy!
In the city


How many ways to get what you want
I use the best, I use the rest
I use the N.M.E
I use anarchy
'Cause I, I wanna be anarchy!
The only way to be!


Is this the M.P.L.A
Or is this the U.D.A
Or is this the I.R.A
I thought it was the U.K
Or just another country
Another council tenancy

I wanna be anarchy
And I wanna be anarchy
Know what I mean?
And I wanna be anarchist!
I get pissed, destroy!22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She was a girl from Birmingham
She just had an abortion
She was case of insanity
Her name was Pauline she lived in a tree
She was a no-one who killed her baby
She sent her letter from the country
She was an animal
She was a bloody disgrace

Body I'm not an animal

Dragged on a table in factory
Illegitimate place to be
In a packet in a lavatory

Not an animal

Throbbing squirm
Gurgling bloody mess

A cheap holiday in other people's misery

Oh, now I got a reason, now I got a reason

I'm gonna go over and over the Berlin wall
I gotta go over the Berlin Wall

There's too many closets I went in before
And now I got a reason, it's no real reason to be waiting

Cheap dialogue, cheap essential scenery

I've seen you in the mirror when the story began
And I fell in love with you, I love your mortal sin
Your brains are locked away but I love your company
I only ever leave you when you got no money
I got no emotions for anybody else
You better understand I'm in love with myself, myself
My beautiful self

And no feelings, and no feelings
And no feelings for anybody else

Hello and goodbye in a run around sue
You follow me around like a pretty pot of glue
I kick you in the head you got nothing to say
Get out of the way 'cos I gotta get away
You never realise I take the piss out of you
You come up and see me and I'll beat you black and blue
Okay, I'll send you away

I got no feelings, ah no feelings
No feelings for anybody else
Except for myself, my beautiful selfish
There ain't no moonlight after midnight
I see you silly people out looking for delight
Well I'm so happy I'm feeling so fine
I'm watching all the rubbish, you're wasting my time
I look around your house and you got nothing to steal
I kick you in the brains when you get down to kneel
And pray, you pray to your god

No feelings, ah no feelings
No feelings for anybody else
No feelings, ah no feelings
No feelings for anybody else
Except for myself
Your daddy's gone away
Be back another day
See his picture hanging on your wall6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You're made in Japan
From cheese and chalk
You're hippy tarts hero
'cos you put on bad show
Oh don't it show

Still oh out on those pills
Oh do you remember

Think it is well playing Max's Kansas
You're looking bored
And you're acting flash
With nothing in your gut
You better keep yer mouth shut
You better keep yer mouth shut
In a rut

Still oh out on those pills
Do the sambo

You four years on
You still look the same
I think about time
You changed your brain
You're just a pile of shit
You're coming to this
Ya poor little faggot
You're sealed with a kiss
Kiss me
Think it's well playing in Japan
When everybody knows Japan is a dishpan
You're just a pile of shit
You're coming to this
Ya poor little faggot
You're sealed with a kiss
Still oh out on those pills
Cheap thrills Anadins
Aspros anything you're condemned
To eternal bullshit
You're sealed with a kiss
Kiss me

A looking for a kiss you're coming to this
I wanna kiss anything

People said we couldn't play
They called us foul-mouthed yobs
But the only notes that really count
Are the ones that come in wads
They all drowned when the air turned blue
Cause we didn't give a toss
Filthy lucre, isn't nothing new
But we all get cash from the chaos

The time is right to do it now
The greatest rock and roll swindle
The time is right to do it now

E.M.I. said you are out of hand
And they gave us the boot
But they couldn't sack us, just like that
Without giving us the loot
Thank you kindly A & M
They said we were out of bounds
But that isn't bad for two weeks work
And 75,000 pounds
 
I just want to play with my band
Are you good enough for me
Hiya boys I'm the chosen one
Can't you fucking see
I'm a jealous god and I want everything
And I love you with a knife
I'll take you, if you're ready for me
And I'll give you my life

It was on the good ship Venus
By Christ, you should have seen us
The figurehead was a whore in bed
And the mast, a mammoth penis
The Captain of this lugger
He was a dirty bugger
He wasn't fit to shovel shit
From one place to another

Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
There was fuck all else to do

Captain's name was Morgan
By Christ, he was a gorgon
Ten times a day sweet tunes he'd play
With his fucking organ
The first mate's name was Cooper
By Christ, he was a trooper
He jerked and jerked until he worked
Himself into a stupor
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
There was fuck all else to do

The second mate was Andy
By Christ, he had a dandy
Till they crushed his cock on a jagged rock
For cumming in the brandy
The cabin boy was Flipper
He was a fucking nipper
He stuffed his ass with broken glass
And circumcised the skipper

Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
There was fuck all else to do
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
There was fuck all else to do
The Captain's wife was Mabel
To fuck, she wasn't able
So the dirty shits, they nailed her tits
Across the barroom table
The Captain had a daughter
Who fell in deep sea water
And by her squeals we knew the eels
Had found her sexual quarters

Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
There was fuck all else to do

And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
You cunt, I'm not a queer
I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
And each and every highway
And that, much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
I saw it through without exemption
I've planned each charted course
Each careful step along the highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
There were times
I'm sure you knew
When there was fuck, fuck
Fuck all else to do
But through it all
When there was doubt
I shot it up or kicked it out
I faced 'em all and the world
And did it my way
I've loved and been a snide
I've had my fill, uh
My share of losing
And now the tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think, I killed a cat
And might I say
Not in the die way
Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way
For what is a brat
What has he got
When he wears hats
And he cannot
Say the things he truly feels
But only the words
Of one who kneels
The record shows
I fucked no bloke
And did it my way1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
