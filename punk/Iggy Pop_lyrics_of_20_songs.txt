You know it looks so good tonight

I look through my window so bright
I see the stars come out tonight
I see the bright and hollow sky
Over the city's ripping sky
And everything looks good tonight

Get into the car
We'll be the passenger

We'll see the bright and hollow sky
We'll see the stars that shine so bright
The sky was made for us tonight
Oh, the passenger
How, how he rides
Oh, the passenger
He rides and he rides
He looks through his window
What does he see?
He sees the sight of hollow sky
He sees the stars come out tonight
He sees the city's ripped backsides
He sees the winding ocean drive
And everything was made for you and me
All of it was made for you and me
'Cause it just belongs to you and me
So let's take a ride and see what's mine

Singin' la la la la la la la la

Oh, the passenger
He rides and he rides
He sees things from under glass
He looks through his window's eye

He sees the bright and hollow sky
He sees the city asleep at night
He sees the stars are out tonight
And all of it is yours and mine
And all of it is yours and mine
So let's ride and ride and ride and ride

Gardenia
Where are you?
Black goddess in a shabby raincoat
Where are you tonight?
Cheap purple baby-doll dress
A gardenia in your hair
Much taller and stronger than me
A forbidden dream, a dream, a dream

All I wanna do is tell Gardenia
What to do tonight
All I wanna do is tell Gardenia
What to do tonight

Gardenia
Where are you, tonight?
The streets were your home
Now where do you roam?
Your hourglass ass
And your powerful back
Your slant devil eyes
And the ditch on your spine
Deep ass, deep ass
All I wanna do is tell Gardenia
What to do tonight
All I wanna do is tell Gardenia
What to do tonight

We lay in the darkness
Then she turned the lights on
I saw a dangerous habit
When she turned the lights on
There's always a catch
In the darkness when you
When you turn the lights on
There's always a catch
Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh well

All I wanna do is tell Gardenia
What to do tonight
All I wanna do is tell Gardenia
What to do tonight

Alone in the cheapo motel
By the highway to hell
America's greatest living poet
Was ogling you all night
You should be wearing the finest gown
But here you are now
Gas, food, lodging, poverty, misery
And gardenia
You could be burned at the stake
For all your mistakes, mistakes, mistakes
All I wanna do is tell Gardenia
What to do tonight
All I wanna do is tell Gardenia

It's okay, it's alright
The promise of the tongue
Leaving them behind tonight
But I guess this time, I'm doubled up
I'm doubled down again
I got no time to turn it around again

Hail to the thief
And you won't get nothing much
Hail to the thief
And we'll keep what's left tonight

A little faith, too little pride
Will we ever get it right?
Keep looking for a sign tonight
But I guess it's time, I'm doubled up
And doubled down again
Got no time to turn it around again

Hail to the thief
And you won't get nothing much
Hail to the thief
And we'll keep what's left tonight

I slept with Sable when she was 13
Her parents were too rich to do anything
She rocked her way around LA
'Til a New York Doll carried her away
Look away
Look away
Now he was blond and she was dark
They called him Thunder 'cause he had the spark
The dream he dreamed was straight and pure
But the confusion of life was gonna get him for sure
Look away
Look away
They shared their clothes and their cowboy boots
Left them all over the floor while they dyed their roots
They live the dream and they went non-stop
They did ok 'til the band broke up
Look away
Look away
Look away
Look away
Unfortunately, the needle broke
Their rock and roll love like a bicycle spoke
I found her in a back street with her looks half gone
She was sellin' something that I was on
Look away
Look away
Now Thunder and me did not part friends
What we did once, I wouldn't do again
So he stayed with the pure dream and followed the moon
'Til the drugs in his body made his mind a cartoon
Look away
Look away
So a few years later, Thunder died broke
Sable had a baby back at her folks'
Me, I went straight and serious, too
There wasn't much else that I could do
Look away
Look away
So now that I'm straight, I'm settled, too
I eat and I sleep and I work like you
I got lots of feelings, but I hold them down
That's a way I cope with this shitty town
Look away
Look away
Look away
Look awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

What happened to Zeke?
He's dead on Jones, man
How about Dave?
O.D'd on alcohol
Oh, what's Rock doing?
Oh, he's living with his mother
What about James?
He's gone straight

Well, things have been tough
Without the Dum Dum Boys
I can't seem to speak the language
I remember how they
Used to stare at the ground
They looked as if they
Put the whole world
Looked as if they put
The whole world down
The first time I met the Dum Dum Boys
I was fascinated
They just stood in front of the old drug store
I was most impressed
No one else was impressed, not at all
And we'd sing da, da, da, da, da, dum, dum, day
Well, where are you now my Dum Dum Boys?
Are you alive or dead?
Have you left me the last of the Dum Dum daze?
And then the sun goes down
And then the boys broke down
People said we were negative
They said we would take but we would never give
But we'd sing da, da, da, da, da, da, dum, dum, day
We'd sing da, da, da, da, da, da and hope it would pay
We'd sing da, da, da, da, da, dum, dum, dum, dum, day
Dum, dum day
Well now, I'm looking for the Dum Dum Boys
Hey, where are you now when I need your noise?
Now, I'm looking for the Dum Dum Boys
The walls close in and I need some noiseEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I couldn't escape this feeling
With my China girl
I'm just a wreck without
My little China girl

I'd hear her heart beating
Loud as thunder
Saw the stars crashing

I'm a mess without
My China girl
Wake up mornings
There's no China girl

I'd hear hearts beating
Loud as thunder
I'd see stars crashing down

I'd feel tragic
Like I was Marlon Brando
When I'd look at my China girl
I could pretend that nothing
Really meant too much
When I'd look at my China girl
I'd stumble into town
Just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
And plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you men
Who want to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh, Jimmy, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "Shh"3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Going to keep a swinging baby

Going to meet all my friends
Going to have ourself a ball

Going to tell them all

It's a rainy afternoon in 1990
The big city
Geez, it's been twenty years
Candy, you were so fine

Beautiful, beautiful girl from the North
You burned my heart with a flickering torch
I had a dream that no one else could see
You gave me love for free

Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go
All my life, you're haunting me, I loved you so
Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go

Life is crazy
Candy, baby

Yeah, well it hurt me real bad when you left
Hey, I'm glad you got out, but, but I miss you

I've had a hole in my heart for so long
I've learned to fake it and just smile along
Down on the street, those men are all the same
I need a love, not games, not games
Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go
All my life, you're haunting me, I loved you so
Candy, Candy, Candy, I can't let you go

Life is crazy
I know, baby
Candy, baby
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

All my life, you're haunting me, I loved you so

This house is as slick as a senator’s statement
This job is a masquerade of recreation
Like a wreck, I’m sinking fast

The key to everything, I crawl for Sunday
When I don’t have to move
Caught up in dreams untangled one day
Where I don’t have to prove
The days roll on and finally Sunday
A Sunday afternoon
I've got it all, but what's it for?
But getting some more

Always ready, always steady now
Always ready, always steady now

This street is as cold as a corporate lawsuit
A pride, I won't chides telling me to wipe my boot
I’m a wreck, what did you expect?

The key to everything, I crawl for Sunday
When I don’t have to move
Caught up in dreams untangled one day

Do what they say, and endure what they say, go back
Do what they say, and endure what they say, go back

Do what they say, and do what they say, till Sunday
Until I’m black and blue

Not a damn thing

Just a bunch of people scared
Everybody's fucking scared
Fear eats all the souls at once
I'm tired of it
And I dream about getting away
To a new life
Where there's not so much fucking knowledge
I don't want any of this information
I don't want YOU
No
Not anymore
I've had enough of you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
I'm gonna go to Paraguay
To live in a compound under the trees
With servants and bodyguards who love me
Free of criticism
Free of manners and mores
I wanna be your basic clod
Who made good
And went away while he could
To somewhere where people are still human beings
Where they have spirit
You take your motherfucking laptop
And just shove it into your goddamn foul mouth
And down your shit heel gizzard
You fucking phony two faced three timing piece of turd
And I hope you shit it out
With all the words in it
And I hope the security services read those words
And pick you up and flay you
For all your evil and poisonous intentions
Because I'm sick
And it's your fault
And I'm gonna go heal myself now
Yeah!3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

All need
Clock's ticking, not giving her room to breathe
To breathe

Loves screaming
Loves missing

Loves screaming, so quietly and in pain
Loves absent, it's failing her once again, again

Loves screaming
Loves screaming

Dark future, she just needs someone to say
To say
"I love you", before she gets pushed away

Loves absent
Loves absent
The center won't hold me in
Loves absent
And she cannot touch a friend
