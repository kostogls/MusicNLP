It kills me not to know this
But I've all but just forgotten
What the color of her eyes were
And her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down
A single tear is droppin'
Through the valleys of an aging face
That this world has forgotten

There is no reconciliation
That will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present
To drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true
When I'm constantly failing you
Like walls that we just can't break through
Until we disappear

So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? ’Cause I don't know

That's when she said, "I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!" (Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, "I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!"
Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!
And the day pressed on like crushing weights
For no man does it ever wait
Like memories of dying days
That deafen us like hurricanes
Bathed in flames we held the brand
Uncurled the fingers in your hand
Pressed into the flesh like sand
Now do you understand?

So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? ’Cause I don't know

That's when she said, "I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!" (Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, "I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!"
Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!

One thousand miles away, there's nothing left to say
But so much left that I don't know
We never had a choice, this world is too much noise
It takes me under, it takes me under once again...
I don't hate you...
I don't hate you, no...

So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? ’Cause I don't know

That's when she said, "I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!" (Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, "I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!"
Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!

I don't hate you
I don't hate you, no

He said, "Son, have you seen the world?
Well, what would you say, if I said that you could?
Just carry this gun, you'll even get paid"
I said, "That sounds pretty good"
Black leather boots, spit-shined so bright
They cut off my hair, but it looks alright
We marched and we sang, we all became friends
As we learned how to fight

A hero of war
Yeah, that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
'Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

I kicked in the door, I yelled my commands
The children, they cried, but I got my man
We took him away, a bag over his face
From his family and his friends
They took off his clothes, they pissed in his hands
I told them to stop, but then I joined in
We beat him with guns, and batons not just once
But again and again
A hero of war
Yeah, that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
'Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

She walked through bullets and haze
I asked her to stop, I begged her to stay
But she pressed on, so I lifted my gun
And I fired away
And the shells jumped through the smoke
And into the sand that the blood now had soaked
She collapsed with a flag in her hand
A flag white as snow

A hero of war
Is that what they see?
Just medals and scars
So damn proud of me
And I brought home that flag
Now it gathers dust
But it's a flag that I love
It's the only flag I trust
He said, "Son
Have you seen the world?
Well, what would you say
If I said that you could?"40EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Woah, woah

Bang bang go the coffin nails
Like a breath exhaled, then gone forever
It seems like just yesterday
How did I miss the red flags raised?
Think back to the days we laughed
We braved these bitter storms together
Brought to his knees he cried
But on his feet he died
What God would damn a heart?
And what God drove us apart?
What God could?
Make it stop, let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this, a weightless step
On the way down singing
Woah, woah

Bang bang from the closet walls
The schoolhouse halls, the shotgun's loaded
Push me and I'll push back
I'm done asking, I demand
From the nation under God
I feel its love like a cattle prod
Born free but still, they hate
Born me, no I can't change
It's always darkest just before the dawn
So stay awake with me, let's prove them wrong
Make it stop, let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this, a weightless step
On the way down singing
Woah, woah

The cold river washed him away
But how could we forget?
The gatherings hold candles, but not their tongues
And too much blood has flown from the wrists
Of the children shamed for those they chose to kiss
Who will rise to stop the blood?
We're calling for, insisting on
A different beat, yeah
A brand new song
Tyler Clementi, age 18
Billy Lucas, age 15
Harrison Chase Brown, age 15
Cody J. Barker, age 17
Seth Walsh, age 13
Make it stop, let this end
This life chose me, I’m not lost in sin
But proud I stand of who I am
I plan to go on living
Make it stop, let this end
All these years pushed to the ledge
But proud I stand of who I am
I plan to go on living28EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Warm yourself by the fire, son
And the morning will come soon
I’ll tell you stories of a better time
In a place that we once knew
Before we packed our bags
And left all this behind us in the dust
We had a place that we could call home
And a life no one could touch

Don’t hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don’t need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don’t hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don’t need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Down!

We are the angry and the desperate
The hungry and the cold
We are the ones who kept quiet
And always did what we were told
But we’ve been sweating
While you slept so calm in the safety of your home
We’ve been pulling out the nails
That hold up everything you’ve known
Don’t hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don’t need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don’t hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don’t need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!

So open your eyes, child
Let’s be on our way
Broken windows and ashes
Are guiding the way
Keep quiet no longer
We’ll sing through the day
Of the lives that we’ve lost
And the lives we’ve reclaimed
Go!

Don’t hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don’t need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don’t hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don’t need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Down!
Don’t hold me up!
(I don’t need your help, I’ll stand my ground)
Don’t hold me up!
(I don’t need your help)
No! No! No!
Don’t hold me up!
(I don’t need your help, I’ll stand my ground)
Don’t hold me up!
(I don’t need your help, I’ll stand my ground)
Don’t let me down, down, down, down, down!23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Am I loud and clear, or am I breaking up?
Am I still your charm, or am I just bad luck?
Are we getting closer, or are we just getting more lost?

I'll show you mine if you show me yours first
Let's compare scars, I'll tell you whose is worse
Let's unwrite these pages and replace them with our own words

We live on front porches and swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I'll slave till the end
I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand

I've been here so long, I think that it's time to move
The winter's so cold, summer's over too soon
Let's pack our bags and settle down where palm trees grow

I've got some friends, some that I hardly know
But we've had some times, I wouldn't trade for the world
We chase these days down with talks of the places that we will go
We live on front porches and swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I'll slave till the end
I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand
Until you hold my hand


I'll show you mine if you show me yours first
Let's compare scars, I'll tell you whose is worse

You can't feel the heat until you hold your hand over the flame
You have to cross the line just to remember where it lays
You won't know your worth now, son, until you take a hit
And you won't find the beat until you lose yourself in it

That's why we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah, because these are the things that we can't deny
I'm passing over you like a satellite
So catch me if I fall
That's why we stick to your game plans and party lives
But at night we're conspiring by candlelight
We are the orphans of the American Dream
So shine your light on me

You can't fill your cup until you empty all it has
You can't understand what lays ahead if you don't understand the past
You'll never learn to fly until you're standing at the cliff
You can't truly love until you've given up on it

That's why we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah, because these are the things that we can't deny
I'm passing over you like a satellite
So catch me if I fall
That's why we stick to your game plans and party lives
But at night we're conspiring by candlelight
We are the orphans of the American Dream
So shine your light on me
She told me she that she'd never face the world again
So I offered up a plan:

We'll sneak out while they sleep
And sail off in the night
We'll come clean and start over
The rest of our lives
When we're gone, we'll stay gone
Out of sight, out of mind
It's not too late, we have the rest of our lives
We'll sneak out while they sleep
And sail off in the night (we have the rest of our lives)
We'll come clean and start over
The rest of our lives
When we're gone, we'll stay gone
Out of sight, out of mind (we have the rest of our lives)
It's not too late, we have the rest of our lives
The rest of our lives

Because we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah, because these are the things that we can't deny
I'm passing over you like a satellite
So catch me if I fall
That's why we stick to your game plans and party lives
But at night we're conspiring by candlelight
We are the orphans of the American Dream
So shine your light on me (shine your light on me)
No we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah, because these are the things that we can't deny (shine your light on me)
I'm passing over you like a satellite
'cause these are the things that we can't deny, no

"What are you talking about? America is not going to be destroyed."
"Never?
Rome was destroyed, Greece was destroyed, Persia was destroyed, Spain was destroyed
All great countries are destroyed, why not yours?
How much longer do you think your own country will last?
Forever?"

Block the entrances, close the doors
Seal the exits because this is war
All gave some, some gave all
But for what? I want to know

Carry on, don't mind me
All I gave was everything
And yet you ask me for more
Fought your fight, bought your lie
And in return I lost my life
What purpose does this serve?

A folded flag, a purple heart
A family all but torn a part
I fought with courage to preserve
Not my way of life, but yours


The cowards preach from pedestals
With words like "courage" and "resolve"
But what they meant was "Fuck them all"
Because freedom isn't free
They send our daughters and our sons
To deserts under burning suns
A sacrificial slaughtering
To fill the pockets of the weak
An artificial enemy, are we so easily deceived?
They carry on

"You're a shameful opportunist! What you don't understand is that it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees."
"You have it backwards. It's better to live on your feet than to die on your knees."
Don't carry on, just walk away
How many more sent to their graves?
In this lesson ignored
I fought your fight
Bought your lie
And in return I lost my life
What purpose does this serve?
What purpose did I serve?4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Dancing on the crumbling precipice
The rocks are coming loose just at the edge
Are we laughing? Are we crying?
Are we drowning? Are we dead?
Or was it all a dream?
The bombs are getting closer everyday
"That can never happen here" we used to say
Have these wars come to our doorstep?
Has this moment finally come?
Or was it all a dream?

Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good, good enough or is it all a dream?

To a predetermined fate, are we condemned?
Or maybe we're a book without an end?
We're not stories, we're not actors
We're awake and in control
And this is not a dream
So can we break this mold?
And set in motion something new
Forgetting what we know
An evolution overdue
Fight the current
Pull the ripcord
Get away!

Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good, good enough?

Well trodden paths are all we take
We need a storm; let's pray for rain now
To wash these roads away
Let's get off track and wander far
Same roads lead to same destinations
Follow nothing but your heart
We're talking in our sleep
And sleeping through our lives
We dream of the places where we never die
We step from the shadows
And into the light
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Are we not good, good enough?
Or was it all a dream...11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In fields where nothing grew but weeds
I found a flower at my feet
Bending there in my direction
I wrapped a hand around its stem
I pulled until the roots gave in
Finding there what I'd been missing
But I know...
So I tell myself, I tell myself it's wrong
There's a point we pass from which we can't return
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm

All because of you
I haven't slept in so long
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down
I'll follow your voice
All you have to do is shout it out

Inside my hands these petals browned
Dried up, fallen to the ground
But it was already too late now
I pushed my fingers through the earth
Returned this flower to the dirt
So it could live. I walked away now
But I know...
Not a day goes by that I don't feel this burn
There's a point we pass from which we can't return
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm

All because of you
I haven't slept in so long
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down
I'll follow your voice
All you have to do is shout it out

All because of you...
All because of you...

All because of you
I haven't slept in so long
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down
Inside these arms of yours
All because of you
I believe in angels
Not the kind with wings
No, not the kind with halos
The kind that bring you home
When home becomes a strange place
I'll follow your voice
All you have to do is shout it out

I can see the storms, in her eyes now
I'm falling overboard, in the waves
In over my head and she's a high tide
That keeps pushing me away
I thought that we would build this together
But everything I touch just seems to break
Am I your sail or your anchor?
Am I the calm or the hurricane?
I feel the ground start to shake
I hear a voice shouting, "Move!"
But there is no fucking way I'd leave you

So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

But is the soundtrack to our lives
The bang of a slamming door?
What happens when we all start to feel like
Nothing matters anymore?
Every day like a chambered round
A trigger pulled, a hammer click
A breath we hold, a world outside I can't control
No matter what I do
So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

And how is it a thing?
That we just wanna hurt each other
I'm waiting out the rain
Feels like it's gonna rain forever
Someday you will learn
That all I ever did was for you
And I would do it all again
I would do it all again

'Til then I'll hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I can't let go of you
Of you, of you, of you, of you3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

On the edges of the sharpest knives
In the middle of the darkest nights
Always knew that I would find you here
In a puddle of the bravest tears
I've seen enough to know
It's lonely where you are

Above the crowd
Feet dangling from a rooftop (A rooftop)
She waits from ledges
For a voice to talk her down

And nothing matters but the pain when you're alone (Still waiting)
The never-ending nights when you're awake (Still waiting)
When you're praying that tomorrow it's okay
There will be a time to crack another smile (Still waiting)
Maybe not today or for a while (Still waiting)
But we're holding on to laugh again some day
To laugh again some day

All that matters is the time we had
Doesn't matter how it all went bad
Never wonder what it might be like
Shut the door, say goodbye
When faced with tragedy (When faced with tragedy)
We come alive or come undone
So don't look back
Let it shape you like an ocean
Even the deepest scars
In time will fade

And nothing matters but the pain when you're alone (Still waiting)
The never-ending nights when you're awake (Still waiting)
When you're praying that tomorrow it's okay
There will be a time to crack another smile (Still waiting)
Maybe not today or for a while (Still waiting)
But we're holding on to laugh again some day
Yeah, we're holding on to laugh again some day

And sometimes you have to go back
To know just where you have been
But we're old enough to know that
What has been will be again
And again, oh-uh-oh
And the bravest of faces
Are the ones where we fake it
In the roles that we play
Nothing matters when the pain is all but gone
When you are finally awake
Despite the overwhelming odds, tomorrow came
And when they see you crack a smile
And you decide to stay awhile
You'll be ready then to laugh again

Nothing matters but the pain (We are tragedy, yeah, we are sympathy)
Nothing matters but the pain
You see what you want to see
Nothing matters but the pain (We are misery and distant memories)
Nothing matters but the pain
We all learn to laugh again
Yeah, we all learn to laugh again
Oh, we will learn to laugh again12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I have my mother's dreams, I have my father's eyes
You can't take that from me, just go ahead and try
The Crescent City sleeps, while giants in the sky
Preparing to unleash, let loose a mighty cry
Can nobody save us? Will anyone try?
The bayou is burning, the cypress has died
And all alone they're saying

Help is on the way (they said, they said)
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
One by land, two by sea, right there in front of me
Help is on the way
Five thousand feet below, as black smoke engulfs the sky
The ocean floor explodes, eleven mothers cry
My bones all resonate a burning lullaby
You can't take that from me, just go ahead and try
She stands at the shoreline with hands in the air
Her words pierce the dark night, "does anyone care?"
And all alone they're saying
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
One by land, two by sea, right there in front of me
Help is on the way

Right here, right here
Right here, right here
Right here, right here

Choking on the black gold, upon which we rely
We keep axes in the attics to see cameras in the sky
"Help is on the way" they said, they said
"Help is on the way" they said, they said
We were told just to sit tight
Cause somebody will soon arrive
"Help is on the way"
But it never came
It never came

Help is on the way (they said, they said)
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
One by land, two by sea, right there in front of me

I can still remember the words and what they meant
As we etched them with our fingers in years of wet cement
The days blurred into each other, though everything seemed clear
We cruised along at half speed, but then we shifted gears

We ran like vampires from a thousand burning suns
But even then, we should have stayed

But we ran away, now all my friends are gone
Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved
Run away, but what are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one

Where have they gone?

Identities assume us as nine and five add up
Synchronizing watches to the seconds that we lost
I looked up and saw you, I know that you saw me
We froze, but for a moment in empathy

I brought down the sky for you, but all you did was shrug
You gave my emptiness a name
But you ran away, now all my friends are gone
Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved
Run away, but what are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one

Where have they gone?

We're all okay, until the day we're not
The surface shines, while the inside rots
We raced the sunset and we almost won
We slammed the brakes, but the wheels went on

We ran away, now all my friends are gone
Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved
Runaway but what are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one

Light up the torches and wake up the King
The smoke you’ve ignored is a flame you can’t contain
We circle the walls and claw at the dirt
We growl from our guts and howl until it hurts

I told her to come with me
And I can take you from this place now
Somewhere these roads all go
Someplace so we can start again
I grabbed her hand and pulled her close
She looked at me and said
“Hey I don’t even know
Your name”

“But are you ready to explode?
Like a tiger in a circus?
Cracking whips are all I know
And searching for a sense of purpose”

We are the wolves at the gates

Break through the undertow
Your hands I can't seem to find
Pollution burns my tongue
Cough words I can't speak, so I
Stop my struggling
Then I float to the surface
Fill my lungs with air, then let it out

I give it all
Now there's a reason why I sing
So give it all
And it's these reasons that belong to me

Rock bottom's where we live
And still we dig these trenches
To bury ourselves in them
Backs breaking under tension
Before far too long these voices
Muffled by distances
It's time to come to our senses
Up from the dirt

We give it all
Now there's a reason why I sing
So give it all
And it's these reasons that belong to me
Breathe (breathe)
The air we give (give)
The life we live (live)
Our pulses racing distances
(Breathe) so wet my tongue
(Give) break into song
(Live) through seas of competition

So please believe your eyes
A sacrifice
Is not what we had in our minds
I'm coming home tonight
Home tonight

We give it all
Now there's a reason why I sing

My God is better than yours
And the walls of my house are so thick
I hear nothing at all
I followed you out in the storm
But it carried you off
And I burned every picture of yours
Was that not enough?

My gun is bigger than yours
So let's arm the masses
And see what the bastards do then
Walking tall once set us apart
Now we're down on all fours
Do you cry my name in the dark
Like I do yours?

These storms are getting stronger now
Trusses all bend and sway
Lightning hits, the power goes out in the fray

As the waves crash high
And the shoreline disappears
I will scream to the sky
"Hey, people live here"
My dreams are not unlike yours
They long for the safety
And break like a glass chandelier
But there's laughter and oh, there is love
Just past the edge of our fears
And there's chaos when push comes to shove
But it's music to my ears

May you be in Heaven before the Devil knows you're dead
May these winds be always at your back

'Cause when we're all just ghosts
And the madness overtakes us
We will look at the ashes
And say, "People lived here"

From the penthouse to the holy martyr
Sea to shining sea
From the coffins full of kindergartners
Is this what you call free?
From the hate that drips from all your crosses
Are your hands so clean?
There's a wildfire and it's spreading far
From sea to shining sea
When we're all just ghosts
And the madness overtakes us
I will scream to the sky
Yeah, I'll scream to the sky
Yeah, I'll scream to the sky

To the sound of a heartbeat pounding away
To the rhythm of the awful rusted machines
We toss and turn but don't sleep
Each breath we take makes us thieves
Like causes without rebels
Just talk but promise nothing else

We crawl on our knees for you
Under a sky no longer blue
We sweat all day long for you
But we sow seeds to see us through
Cause sometimes dreams just don't come true
We wait to reap what we are due

To the rhythm of a time bomb ticking away
And the blare of the sirens combing the streets
Chased down like dogs we run from
Your grasp until the sun comes up

We crawl on our knees for you
Under a sky no longer blue
We sweat all day long for you
But we sow seeds to see us through
Cause sometimes dreams just don't come true
Look now at what they've done to you
White needles buried in the red
The engine roars and then it gives
But never dies
Cause we don't live
We just survive
On the scraps that you throw away

I won't crawl on my knees for you
I won't believe the lies that hide the truth
I won't sweat one more drop for you
Cause we are the rust upon your gears
We are the insect in your ears
We crawl
We crawl
We crawl
All over you

We sow the seeds to see us through
Our days are precious and so few
We all reap what we are due
Under this sky no longer blue
We bring the dawn long overdue
We crawl
We crawl
We crawl
All over you7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Somewhere between happy, and total fucking wreck
Feet sometimes on solid ground, sometimes at the edge
To spend your waking moments, simply killing time
Is to give up on your hopes and dreams, to give up on your...

Life for you, (who we are) has been less than kind
So take a number, (who we are) stand in line
We've all been sorry, (who we are) we've all been hurt
But how we survive, (who we are) is what makes us who we are

An obvious disinterest, a barely managed smile
A deep nod in agreement, a status quo exile
I shirk my obligations, I miss all your deadlines
I excel at quitting early, and fucking up my life

Life for you, (who we are) has been less than kind
So take a number, (who we are) stand in line
We've all been sorry, (who we are) we've all been hurt
But how we survive, (who we are) is what makes us who we are

All smiles and sunshine, a perfect world on a perfect day
Everything always works out, I have never felt so fucking great
All smiles and sunshine, a perfect world on a perfect day
Everything always works out, I have never felt so great
(Life isn't like this)
(Life isn't like this)
(Life isn't like this)
(Life isn't like this)
(Life isn't like this) Life isn't like this
(Life isn't like this) Life isn't like this
(Life isn't like this) Are we verging on an answer
Or fucking up our...

Life for you, (who we are) has been less than kind
So take a number, (who we are) stand in line
We've all been sorry, (who we are) we've all been hurt
But how we survive, (who we are) is what makes us who we are
(Who we are)
It's what makes us who we are
(Who we are)
Makes us who we are
(Who we are)
It's what makes us who we are

You spend your days counting the hours you're awake
And when night covers the sky you find yourself doing the same
It's a burden you've been burying in spite of all your prayers
As the light turns off inside your heart can you remember
What it's like to care?
Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe

So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go
Pull this plug, let me breath
On my own I'm finally free
Don't let me go

The trail of crumbs you left somehow got lost along the way
If you never meant to leave then you only had to stay
With the memories that haunt us, I cherish just the same
As the ones that bring us closer to the sky, no matter how grave
Yet I fall through these clouds and she's screaming

So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go
Pull this plug, let me breath
On my own I'm finally free
Don't let me go
This grip loosens but it never breaks
We carry nothing but a name you will forsake
Your words are always there to break my fall
And now I find the comfort to see through it all

Guide me through uncharted waters
Before we lose our way again
Will you be my compass
Until forever, until forever ends
Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe

So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go
Pull this plug, let me breath
On my own I'm finally free
Don't let me go

Don't let me go6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

On pins and needles we are waiting for the fall
We count the days scratching lines on the wall
Wait in the wings at someone's beck and call
No longer recognize the place that I call home
No longer recognize this face as my own
Somewhere, this fate, I lost control

We backed down
We took no for answers far too long
We felt those walls close around
I don't wanna be here anymore
I don't wanna be here anymore

I don't wanna be here anymore (Be here anymore)
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured (Oh-ah-oh, oh-ah-oh)
See, I don't think I can fight this anymore (Fight this anymore)
I'm listening with one foot out the door
And something has to die to be reborn
And I don't wanna be here (Be here) anymore

On hand and foot we answered every single call
And weathered every day like passing storms
But when we break we will all be gone (We will all be gone)
Won't back down, won't take no for answers anymore (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
These walls close, we pace back and forth
I don't wanna be here anymore (Be here anymore)
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured (Oh-ah-oh, oh-ah-oh)
See, I don't think I can fight this anymore (Fight this anymore)
I'm listening with one foot out the door
And something has to die to be reborn
And I don't wanna be here (Be here) anymore

The point where we break gets closer everyday
But where do we go?
But where do we go?

I don't wanna be here anymore
I don't wanna be here anymore

I don't wanna be here anymore (Be here anymore)
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured (Oh-ah-oh, oh-ah-oh)
See, I don't think I can fight this anymore (Fight this anymore)
I'm listening with one foot out the door
And something has to die to be reborn
And I don't wanna be here (Be here) anymore
