Ever get the feeling you can't go on
Just remember whose side it is that you're on

Someone will pick you up again
We can conquer anything together
All of us are bonded forever
If I die, you die, that's the way it is

Someday you gotta find another way
You better right your mind and live by what you say
Today is just another day
Unless you set your sights and try to find a way
I say fuck authority
Silent majority
Raised by the system
Now it's time to rise against them
We're sick of your treason
Sick of your lies
Fuck no, we won't listen
We're gonna open your eyes
Frustration, domination
Feel the rage of a new generation
We're living, we're dying
And we're never ever gonna stop, stop trying
Stop trying, stop trying, stop trying
You know the time is right to take control
We got to take offense against the status quo
No way, not gonna stand for it today
Fight for your rights, it's time we had our say!
I say fuck authority
Silent majority
Raised by the system
Now it's time to rise against them
We're sick of your treason
Sick of your lies
Fuck no, we won't listen
We're gonna open your eyes!
Frustration, domination
Feel the rage of a new generation
We're living, we're dying
We're sick and tired of relentless lying
Destroy, enjoy, your fuckin' world is our new toy
Dominate, eliminate
You're gonna feel the wrath, wrath of hate
Fuck authority!
Silent majority!
Raised by the system
Now it's time to rise against them!
We're sick of your treason
Sick of your lies!
Fuck no, we won't listen
We're gonna open your eyes!
Frustration, domination
Feel the rage of a new generation
We're living, we're dying
And we're never ever gonna stop, stop trying
Stop trying, stop trying, stop trying...1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Clear your mind
Hide your fear
Don't look around
Don't turn around
Pennywise is here
Hold your feelings
Hide your fear
Don't look around
Don't turn around
Pennywise is here

Evil lurks in his eyes
The clown they call Pennywise
He'll catch you by suprise
The clown they call Pennywise
He's a monster
He's not human
He's more than just a figment of your imagination
You can't run can't hide
There's no way to escape Pennywise

Evil lurks in his eyes
The clown they call Pennywise
He'll catch you by suprise
The clown they call Pennywise
He'll creep inside your soul at night
And torment nice and slow
Don't turn around or look around
Pennywise will know
He'll make you wish that you were dead
And make it hard to cope
He'll make you wish that you were dead
And hanging by a rope

Evil lurks in his eyes
The clown they call Pennywise
He'll catch you by suprise
The clown they call Pennywise
Clear your mind
Hide your fear
Don't look around
Don't turn around
Pennywise is hereEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Father teach me, tell me, who are all my enemies
Are they my neighbors who believe a different scroll
Are they around the world shouting out a hypocrisy
It doesn't seem right
Seeming like a genocide
Teach me all your ancient wisdom and your biases
These kind of grudges that been handed down the line
I've got my chin up, just repeat the racist shit you say

It doesn't seem right
We're running on suicide
We prolong the fight
We're drowning and it's never gonna die
Don't forget it
We rewrite the truth
The truth is we're worshiping a lie
That's pathetic
The monster devours our youth
And the dreams we make
Get washed away
We're paying with our lives
The truth is that it's never gonna die

Another kid today born into a fallacy
But when we teach them about the wretched past
We'll make another troll spelling out the blasphemy
It doesn't seem right
Seeming like infanticide
Another century of self-fulfilling prophecy
Who in their right mind would believe that it could last
An ancient battle cry that feels just like a dynasty
It doesn't seem right
We're running on suicide
We prolong the fight
We're drowning and it's never gonna die
Don't forget it
We rewrite the truth
The truth is we're worshiping a lie
That's pathetic
The monster devours our youth
And the dreams we make
Get washed away
We're paying with our lives
The truth is that it's never gonna die

A world at war without sensation
The drones are lined and bullets fly
The whole great war abomination
A gentle homicide

It's never gonna die
Don't forget it
We rewrite the truth
The truth is we're worshiping a lie
That's pathetic
The monster devours our youth
And the dreams we make
Get washed away, we're paying with our lives
The truth is that it's never gonna die
The truth is it's never gonna die

As we walk through these troubled times
We struggle through this so called life
Waiting for something to change
And now all hope is gone
The pain has lingered far to long
Black is a sky filled with rage
It's been too Long
We're holding on
We'll right this wrong
And fight on
We will remember today
Let me hear You say wo-o-oh
We we want a revolution
One more time in for solutions
Say it again wo-o-oh
We we want a revolution
Now's the time for Retribution
Say it again
That's right
Yesterday is a memory
Your fading light will set us free
Free from these thoughts of despair
Your end is coming fast
We're moving forward, we won't look back
The message will be loud and clear
It's been too Long
We're holding on
We'll right this wrong
And fight on
We will remember today
Let me hear You say wo-o-oh
We we want a revolution
One more time in for solutions
Say it again wo-o-oh
We we want a revolution
Now's the time for Retribution
Say it again
That's right
We stood tall in the pouring rain
Our bodies broken
Our hearts are brave
One million strong
We cannot fall
It's all for one and one for all
Let me hear You say wo-o-oh
We we want a revolution
One more time in for solutions
Say it again wo-o-oh
We we want a revolution
Now's the time for Retribution
Say it again
That's right
We want a revolution
We're living for today
It's time for resolution
And we will remember

One day I met an old man, he said to me
"You gotta live while you can son, you gotta believe
Cause when you're old and dying, it's no fun for you
You gotta live while you can til your days are all through"

And I don't know why the cold wind blows
Man, I don't know about all I've read
I just know that our days are numbered
And this is what he said
"I got a time bomb ticking in my head, ticking in my head
I got a time bomb ticking in my head, ticking in my head"

One day I met a young man, he said "Get out of my way
I've got some living to do and there's no time to delay
Cause when you're old and dying, it's no fun for you
You gotta live while you can til your days are all through"

And I don't know why the cold wind blows
Man, I don't know about all I've read
I just know that our days are numbered
And this is what he said
"I got a time bomb ticking in my head, ticking in my head
I got a time bomb ticking in my head, ticking in my head
I got a time bomb ticking in my head, ticking in my head
I got a time bomb ticking in my head, ticking in my head"
So let's go
And I don't know why the cold wind blows
Man, I don't know about all I've read
I just know that our days are numbered

I can't forget the day when I got the news
Felt like my heart was crushed, I was so confused
You were so alone, could've used a friend
Saw no way out except for it all to end
Wish I could go back to relive that day
Make you understand, make it all okay
Just a little hope, light at the end
Now I hear those words that she said
After a Europe show, I saw her sitting there
Drunk on the curb with a tear-filled stare
Her hair was black and blue, so was her life
Looked like she ended on the edge of a knife
She was drunk as hell, asked me to sign her ink
I don't like that stuff, I didn't know what to think
But she looked desperate like she could use a friend
That's when she looked at me, and she said
Give me the truth, can't take another lie
It might be the night that's gonna save my life
Just know I'm sick to death of the hypocrisy
Just one idea's enough to make us all believe
That we could find a way, to push all of the pain away
So I could just feel good for one single day
And we could say at least we tried
Now I can't forget what she said
I tried to talk to her but it was no use
She had drank too much, she was way too loose
When I tried to speak, I didn't have the words
Even if I did, what would I say to her
Cause I feel lost too, I don't know myself
Sometimes this world is cold, sometimes it feels like hell
Sometimes I feel alone like I could use a friend
That's when I hear the words that she said
Give me the truth, can't take another lie
It might be the night that's gonna save my life
Just know I'm sick to death of the hypocrisy
Just one idea's enough to make us all believe
That we could find a way, to push all of the pain away
So I could just feel good for one single day
And we could say at least we tried
Now I can't forget what she said
I can't forget the day when I got the news
Felt like my heart was crushed, I was so confused
You were so alone, could've used a friend
Saw no way out except for it all to end
Wish I could go back to relive that day
Make you understand, make it all okay
Just a little hope, light up the end
Now I hear those words that she said
Give me the truth, can't take another lie
It might be the night that's gonna save my life
Just know I'm sick to death of the hypocrisy
Just one idea's enough to make us all believe

Everyday convince myself of everything I can and can't believe
Abused, confused
Everyday you feel every crime just stare up at space and wonder why
Afraid, deranged

Hold to your promise you can use it for a crutch
Stand by while all your dreams get trampled in the dust
Leave now before your slick machines begin to rust
Last chance farewell, among us

Everyday you feel a little bit older and everything gets hard you wonder why
Afraid, deranged
Everyday you feel every crime an endless shocking show on the parade
Abused, confused
(Chorus)
Hold to your promise you can use it for a crutch
Stand by while all your dreams get trampled in the dust
Leave now before your slick machines begin to rust
Last chance farewell, among us

Everyday convince myself of everything I can and can't believe
Afraid, deranged
(Chorus)
Hold to your promise you can use it for a crutch
Stand by while all your dreams get trampled in the dust
Leave now before your slick machines begin to rust
Last chance farewell, among us

Dark soldiers creep at night
We're young and we never die
Our numbers multiply
And God is on our side
Deep down we're burned and bruised
We can go anytime you choose
There's no place left for you
So why not light the fuse?
Light the fuse!
Light the fuse!
Now you're in for a fight
War wages through the night
You know you shouldn't even try
(We won't give up the fight!)
And we're never giving in
We've got a fight to win
We'll be the best that's ever been
And we'll fight until the end
For which banner do you bleed?
Prophet or prophecy?
No guts, no victory
And war is all we need
No time for setting suns
Hot steel and smoking guns
Our day is never done
Our battles never won
Never won!
They're never won!
Now you're in for a fight
War wages through the night
You know you shouldn't even try
(We won't give up the fight!)

Look all around you there's a war that's going on
A struggle against the odds that's breaking out and must be won
They're getting ready with the weapons they have found
Take inspiration from the sound
See it in the faces of the people everyday
We need to take control and find some ammo right away
Our cause is righteous and we're gonna have our say
Get ready for the judgement day
Go ahead and try
Or kiss your ass goodbye
People of society are running for their lives
Get up now and go
Or you're never gonna know
Never gonna make it in your houses lying low
Give it one good try
Give it all and fight till you die
A puppet government they're dying in the streets
Families are breaking up cause underpaids can't make ends meet
The establishment has put their money underground
Cause they all know what's coming down
A lucky precious few with money in their banks
Can't imagine what it's like to find yourself in homeless ranks
They've got no conscience for the ones who won't survive
The time for payback has arrived
Go ahead and try
Or kiss your ass goodbye
People of society are running for their lives
Get up now and go
Or you're never gonna know
Never gonna make it in your houses lying low
Give it one good try
Give it all and fight till you die
All alone in your own society
Outside are the cries of the lives in misery
Is it an evil plot of a false democracy
Subjugating souls just dying to be free
Look all around you there's a war that's going on
A struggle against the odds that's breaking out and must be won
They're getting ready with the weapons they have found
Take inspiration from the sound
Go ahead and try
Or kiss your ass goodbye
People of society are running for their lives
Get up now and go

Never gonna make it in your houses lying low

Where do you see yourself when everything goes wrong?
At the bottom of the barrel that's when you must be strong
With chaos all around you, you feel like checking out
Your life is dark and crowded, your mind is full of doubt
Can't you see it's got to be, you gotta somehow try to
Make a difference in your life
Keep strong, it's up to you, you gotta try
And make it through and save your life
Stay strong and carry on
You're only thing that matters, just keep on moving on
Stay strong and carry on
The only thing that matters is your life
Just keep on moving on
You ever feel downhearted, your life is in a rut
Your brain is overloaded and everything just sucks
You hope for something better, you're waiting for a gun
There's people all around but no one says a word
Can't you see it's got to be, you gotta somehow try to
Make a difference in your life
Keep strong, it's up to you, you gotta try
And make it through and save your life
Stay strong and carry on
You're only thing that matters, just keep on moving on
Stay strong and carry on
The only thing that matters is your life
Just keep on moving on
Change it all, it's up to you, you gotta try
And make it through and save your life
Can't you see it's got to be, you gotta somehow try to
Make a difference in your life
The time's out, don't sit around
When everything has got you down, the time is right
It's up to you, there's no excuse, just struggle on
And make it through and save your fucking life

What's the fucking problem
With this world today?
You've become what they wanted and now you're numb
When will you stand up and say
We're living with decisions of the feeble minds
The limits are intended and imposed by time
A poison disease called complacency
Is taking control of our lives
We'll never know until we try
The times is now, it's all or nothing
We are alive, it's do or die
We must believe it's all or nothing now
Why don't you take a look around you
The answers lie in your mind
It's up to each and every one of us
Until the day that we die
We only need to motivate and realize
Alleviate the censure and you'll redefine
Defeat the disease so you can break free
From the struggles you hold deep inside
We'll never know until we try
The times is now, it's all or nothing
We are alive, it's do or die
We must believe it's all or nothing now
We will never know unless we really try
You will never see that there's so much to life
I have stood confused but now i'm open eyed
We're never going to slow down
I believe that we can move on
Conquer our goals and right what is wrong
I believe that we can stay true
True to ourselves and find something new
Find something new
We'll never know until we try
The times is now, it's all or nothing
We are alive, it's do or die

There's a rebellion on ice
And you'll pay the price
As your freedom fades away
Dishonesty is high
So won't you even try
To stand up for your rights and say

We don't want your laws
So take 'em back right now
They're bullshit anyhow
It's time we had our say
The injustice cannot stay
They stabbed us in the back
And you can feel it bleeding
If your heart's beating now

So let us hear your voice
They said we have a choice
But I don't believe
They really meant it so
We're gonna call their bluff
Cause we have had enough
Take the power back
The foundation's gonna crack
I see the freedom at the end of the road
I've heard so many lies and I've taken the blows
Give it to me, take it from me, nobody knows
Sick of being used and I'm gonna explode
Total destruction all over the place
There is so much hate it's a fuckin' disgrace
Everyone is blind, can't see through the lies
But they aren't even looking at the wolves in disguise

So will you hear the call
Or let the judgements fall
This is it, so wake up, let's go
And track the liars down
And then remove their crowns
And lash 'em with the binds they hold


And you can feel it bleeding
If your heart's beating now

I don't think that I, I would want to anyway
And I don't care if never live to see the day
We can't compromise, I'm doing things my way
And I don't care, And I don't know
And I don't care, And I don't know
I don't care if you never see the world like I do
I don't care if you never see the world like I do
I don't care if you never see the world like I do
I don't care if you never see the world like I doEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'd like to encourage you to believe the things I do
Fact is something's wrong inside of me
At times I find it hard to see what I really want to be
And that's when something snaps inside of me
I was once just like you
Born without a fucking clue
And now I live my life to be free
Live your life Jesus Christ
Trouble in paradise
Mom and dad they're not too proud of me
They're not too proud of me
They're not too proud of me
I'm never gonna be it's so plain to see
You are not like me
Look at what you've done to me a product of society
Confusion on your face is plain to see
I can't stand your attitude think I'm lost think I'm rude
Your opinion's invalid to me
You don't like my tatoos how does this dishonor you
Don't you know what's inside of me
Sick and tired of all the lies when will you realize
I'm proud just being me
Yeah yeah I can't believe
Hopeless indecision's got a hold of me
Yeah yeah it's plain to see
I'm a product of society
There's something wrong with me
There's something wrong with me
Never gonna be what you wanna be
You are not like meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
