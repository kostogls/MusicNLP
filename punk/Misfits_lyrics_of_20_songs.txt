I got somethin' to say, I killed a baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me as long as it's dead
Well, I got somethin' to say, I raped your mother today
And it doesn't matter much to me as long as she's spread

Sweet lovely death, I am waitin' for your breath
Come, sweet death, one last caress

Go!

Sweet lovely death, I am waitin' for your breath
Come, sweet death, one last caress

Well, I got somethin' to say, I killed your baby today

Hm, hmm
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

There's fifty-two ways to murder anyone
One and two are the same and they both work as well
I'm coming clean for Amy
Julie doesn't scream as well and the cops won't listen all night
And so maybe I'll be over
Just as soon as I fill them all in

And I can remember when I saw her last
We were runnin' all around and havin' a blast, havin' a blast
But the back seat of the drive-in is so lonely without you
I know when you're home

I was thinkin' about you, there was somethin' I forgot to say
I was cryin' on Saturday night
I was out cruisin' without you
They were playin' our song
Cryin' on Saturday night
As the moon becomes the night time
You go viciously, quietly, away
I'm sitting in the bedroom
Where we used to sit and smoke cigarettes
Now I'm watchin', watchin' you die
Oh oh oh oh oh

I can remember when I saw her last
We were runnin' all around and havin' a blast
But the back seat of the drive-in is so lonely without you
I know when you're home

I was thinkin' about you, there was somethin' I forgot to say
I was cryin' on Saturday night
I was out cruisin' without you
They were playin' our song
Cryin' on Saturday night

If you're gonna scream, scream with me
Moments like this never last
When new creatures rape your face
Hybrids opened up the door

Ooh, baby, when you cry your face is momentary
You hide your looks behind these scars

In hybrid moments, give me a moment
Give me a moment, give me a moment

Ooh, baby, when you cry your face is momentary
You hide your looks behind these scars

In hybrid moments, in hybrid moments
In hybrid moments, in hybrid moments
Give me a moment, give me a moment10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah... Mommy!
One, two, three, four!
Singled out the kids who are mean to me
Gettin' straight A's but, they still make fun
I don't give a, I'll laugh last
Stayed in every night
Do my homework so I'll be smart
Girls all say I'm a little fucked
Mommy, I'm a good boy
Mommy, I'm a fuckin' savior
Mommy, I'm alive
Mommy, can I go out and kill tonight?

Rip the veins from human necks until they're wet with life
Razor-blades love teenage flesh, an epidermoty
I'll bring back a souvenir, for it's my mommy's dream

Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight?

Killed a girl on Lovers' Lane, I kept her toes and teeth
Every night I stalk around until I find my keep
I'll bring back a souvenir, for it's my mommy's dream
Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight?

Killed a girl on Lovers' Lane, I kept her toes and teeth
Every night I stalk around until I find my keep, Mommy

Kill tonight, kill tonight?

Does this face look almost mean
Is it time to be an android, not a man

The pleasantries are gone
We're stripped of all we were

If I cut off your arms and cut off your legs
Would you still love me anyway?
If you're bound and you're gagged, draped and displayed
Would you still love me anyway?

Why don't you love me anyway?

If I cut off your arms and cut off your legs

Go!
Cutting with the knife, blood is spilling everywhere
She will be my wife, secondary spine
Incisions must be accurate, I know just what to do
My hands are trembling, I can't spare to slip up with this knife
Her beauty so illogical, the beast come gliding in
Hideous chameleon stripped down to her skin
Dance to the burning flame, pleasure exhumes the pain
The night bursts into flames
Dance, Helena, dance, oh
If I cut off your arms and I cut off your legs
Would you still love me anyway?
There's a spot on the floor where your limbs used to be
And I close the door on my fantasies

Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?
Why don't you love me anyway?

We walk the streets at night, we go where eagles dare
They pick up every movement, they pick up every loser
With jaded eyes and features, you think they really care

I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby, babe

The omelet of disease awaits your noontime meal
Her mouth of germicide, seducing all your glands

I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby, babe

Let's test your threshold of pain, let's see how long you last
That hatpin in your retina unbosoms all your past
With jaded eyes and features, you think they really care
Let's go where eagles dare, we'll go where eagles dare
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch

President's bullet ridden body in the street
Ride, Johnny, ride
Kennedy's shattered head hits concrete
Ride, Johnny, ride
Johnny's wife is floundering
Johnny's wife is scared
Run, Jackie, run
Texas is an outrage when your husband is dead
Texas is an outrage when they pick up his head
Texas is the reason that the president's dead
You gotta suck, suck, Jackie, suck
President's bullet ridden body in the street
Ride, Johnny, ride
Kennedys shattered head hits concrete

Texas is an outrage when your husband is dead
Texas is an outrage when they pick up his head
Texas is the reason that the president's dead
You gotta suck, suck, Jackie, suck

A-ride Jackie-O
Jonathan F. Kennedy will rise and be shot down
Dirt's gonna be your desert
My cum will be your life source
And the only way to get it
Is to suck
Or fuck
Or be poor and devoid, and masturbate me
Masturbate me, then slurp it from your palms
Like a dry desert soakin' up the rain, soakin' up the sun

Anything is what she is
Anywhere is where she's from
Anything is what she'll be
Anything as long as it's mine
And the door it opened a way back in
Or is it way back out?

Any place is where she'll be
Any place she'll see you from
Lies and secrets become your world
Anytime, anywhere, she takes me away
And death climbs up the steps one by one
To give you the rose that's been burned by her son

Point me to the sky above
I can't get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones

I have seen the demon's face
I have heard of her death place
I fall down on my knees
And praised the ground
Horrible things that took her away
And death climbs up the steps one by one
To give you the rose that's been burned by her son
Point me to the sky above
I can't get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones
Point me to the sky above
I can't get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard

Burning bodies hang from poles
