Not all horses are gonna need blinders
Not all seekers will be finders
Even the gurus only yet to know
Yet there is a path you call your own
Seekers
Finders
Which one are you
Which one am I
We are all just headless riders
Some crack right through
Some only try
Life quest for a unity
Death propels the community
To break all the dividers
To rip off the masks and tear off the blinders
Mind is stuck on survival
Soul it knows no rival
In its one and the onliness
It is the seeker and finder of holiness
Seekers
Finders
Which one are you
Which one am I
We are all just headless riders
Some crack right through
Some only try
Words turn flesh
So go feed your tigers
Light one, dark one both are in pre-flight stance
Which one will defeat the other
It's the one that turns fight into dance
Seekers
Finders
Which one are you
Which one am I
We are all just headless riders
Inside one whole-seeing eyeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When there is trap set up for you
In every corner of this town
And so you learn the only way to go is underground
When there's a trap set up for you
In every corner of your room
And so you learn the only way to go is through the roof
Ooohoohoooh through the roof, underground
And as we're crossing border after border
We realize that difference is none
It's underdog zoo, and if you want it
You always have to make your own fun
And as the upperdog leisurely sighing
The local cultures are dying and dying
The programmed robots are buying and buying
And all secluded freaks they are still trying, trying
Ooohoohoooh through the roof, underground
And as the boy scouts learn to read between the lines
The silver rabbits hop between their fathers' lies
And boy scouts ask "Pa, where do they go?"
They go to the country that they only know
Just like their meanings they lay between the lines
Between the borders their real countries hide
Their strategy was all they advertise
Their strategy of being is one of in-your-face disguise
Ooohoohoooh through the roof, underground!
And when their own walls they will a-crumble
And all the systems will be discumbumbled
Around the stump of bigotry abroad
Серебряные зайцы водят хоровод!
Ooohoohoooh through the roof, underground
Ooohoohoooh through the roof, and underground
Ooohoohoooh through the roof, underground
Ooohoohoooh through the roof! Underground!
Серебряные зайцы там водят хоровод!
Through the roof! And underground!
Through the roof! Underground!2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Back in the day, yo, as we learned
A man was not considered to be
Considered to be fully grown
Has he not gone-a beyond the hills
Has he not crossed the seven seas
Yeah, seven seas at least!
Now all them jokers kept around
Just like the scarecrows in hometown
Yeah, scarecrows in hometown
From screen to screen they're travelin'
But I'm a wonderlust king
I stay on the run
Let me out
Let me be gone
In the world's beat up road sign
I saw new history of time
New history of time
Through Siberian woods
Breaking up their neck
Chinese moving in building discotheques
Trans-Siberian sex toys and whatnot
Yeah, and why not?
Well at least it's something different
From what they got in every other airport
Я не еврей, но кое-что похоже
Соврать не даст ни Юра, ни Сережа!
Simply because I'm not a total gadjo
Да я шут, я трюкач, ну так что же?
I traveled the world
Looking for understanding
Of the times that we live in
Hunting and gathering first hand information
Challenging definitions of sin
I traveled the world
Looking for lovers
Of the ultimate beauty
But never settled in
I am a wonderlust king!
I stay on the run
Let me out
Let me be gone
In the world's beat up road sign
I saw new history of time
New history of time
And presidents
And billionaires
And generals
They'll never know
They'll never know
What I have owned
What I have owned
I am a wonderlust king!1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My family's sleeping on a railroad track
All my life I pack/unpack
But man I got to earn this buck
I gotta pay representation
To be accepted in a nation
Where after efforts of a hero
Welcome start again from zero
It's a book of our true stories
True stories that can't be denied

Have you ever been to American wedding?
Where is the vodka?
Where is marinated herring?
Where is the musicians that got the taste?
Where is the supply that's gonna last three days?
Where is the band that like fanfare
Gonna keep it going 24 hours

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-didi-didi-da-dow
Daaaaaaaa
Dada-dada-dada-da
Daaaa
Dada-dada-dada-da

Instead it's one in the morning
And DJ is patching up the cords
Everybody's full of cake
Staring at the floor
Proper couples start to mumble
That it's time to go
People gotta get up early
Yep, they gotta go

People gotta get up early
And she's gotta boyfriend
And this whole fucking thing
Is one huge disappointment
And nothing gets these bitches going
Not even Gipsy Kings
Nobody talks about my supertheory
Of supereverything!
So be Donald Trump
Or be an anarchist
Make sure that your wedding
Doesn't end up like this

I understand the cultures
Of a different kind
But here word celebration
Just doesn't come to mind!

On burning bridges

In love with witches
And you know my brain is held
Inside by stitches
Yet you know I did survive
All of your lovely sieges
And you know that I'll pick up
Every time you call
Just to thank you one more time

Every time you come
Just to thank you one more time

Nothing is the same

Just to hit a higher note
Every time we make up
Who's crawlin' up my spine - alcohol
I've been waiting long long time - alcohol
Now you teach me how to rhyme - alcohol
Just don't stab me in the back with cortisol
Now we reunite - alcohol
And forever be divine - alcohol

First time I had read the Bible
It had stroke me as unwitty
I think it may started rumor
That the Lord ain't got no humor

Put me inside SSC
Let's test superstring theory
Oh yoi yoi accelerate the protons
I stir it twice and then just add me, cause

I don't read the Bible
I don't trust disciple
Even if they're made of marble
Or Canal Street bling

From the maelstrom of the knowledge
Into the labyrinth of doubt
Frozed underground ocean
Melting, nuking on my mind

Give me Everything Theory
Without Nazi uniformity
My brothers are protons
My sisters are neurons
I stir it twice, it's instant family

My brothers are protons

I stir it twice dlja prekrastnih dam

Do you have sex maniacs
Or schizophrenics
Or astrophysicists in your family
Was my grandma anti, anti
Was my grandpa bounty, bounty

And my grandma she was anti
And my grandpa he was bounty

We stepped together in the river
We traded fever on turmoil
Last time I saw you was in the middle
I wonder if you hit the soil
Where are you now, my companjera?
Your baby claw stuck in my chest
Where are you now, my sonidera?
Who took you from the nest?
Where are you now, my companjera?
I'm beating bricks from town to town
Where are you now, my sonidera?
I'm at my final down, down!
My final down
Right through the muzzle came my surrender
I had to tear it off my mind
Then hypothermia took over
And suddenly I went blind
Where are you now, my companjera?
Your baby claw stuck in my chest
Where are you now, my sonidera?
Who took you from the nest?
Where are you now, my companjera?
I'm beating bricks from town to town
Where are you now, my sonidera
I'm at my final down, down!
My final down
Eat and sleep without desire
"Would you like window or aisle?"
Oh, Miss Sky, you ever seen
Warrior that's more fragile?
Jetlag, hangover, malnutrition
You can't fly in this condition
And if no one intervene
Out of the window is my mission
Where are you now, my companjera?
Your baby claw stuck in my chest
Where are you now, my sonidera?
Who took you from the nest?
Where are you now, my companjera?
I'm beating bricks from town to town

Dogs were barking, guests were parking
And my wedding was about to start
Dogs were barking, monkeys clapping
Then I got up on table and I said:
I'll meet you 10:45 on the Broadway Canal
In a disco-radical-transglobal...
Beat fun coolo feel sextouro
Выдержит не выдержит ли аппаратура...
А наша мама---Diaspora!!!
Папа в Gogol Bordello!!!
Энергия пробуждения ия-я-я!!!
Dogs were barking, monkeys clapping
Bears were dancing and girls were cutting loose
Cops were lurking, kids were snarkling
Then her father came up to me and said:
Вы бывали когда-нибудь на выставке собак?
She was a 5-45, наше дело - табак...
Да я же старый добрый Opta-Hotza-Htzulo-Dzigit!
Говорят просто больной, да ничего же не болит!
Наша мама ---Diaspora!!!
Папа в Gogol Bordello!!!
Энергия пробуждения ия-я-я!!!
Remember things, things that are eternal...
Remember things...you forgot those things
Нельзя понять, нельзя измерить
Только бросать, и только ввысь!...
To make it all even more crooked
Is impossibility of the suicide
You pull the trigger, yet you are still standing...
Just somewhere else, but with same dick in your hand
And the dogs were barking, and the guests were parking
And the monkeys clapping and girls were cutting loose
Thinking 'bout things, things that are eternal
When her mother came up to me and said
Dogs were barking, cops were lurking
And my dancing was about to start!
Monkeys clapping...
...Party!
...Давай товарищ, like tovarisch would...
I met a crazy dancer
A party tabashi

I was walking on one cloudy morning
With uncertain shadow on my soul
Underneath the shadow there was yearning
To be done walking on the burning coal
I'm walking
Burning
Walking
I walking on the burning coal
I'm walking
Ain't it easier to fall
Leave behind scenarios made for you
And stay on a path to your own pole
Ain't no ordinary stroll
Gets the sailor knot in my chest undone
And the shadow
Feels the soul
Turned to ashes
Turned aerial
And you don't need no one to walk you through it
Through this would be world burial
I'm walking
Burning
Walking
I walking on the burning coal
Coal
Coal
Ain't it easier to
Is there anybody coming here to see
Is there anybody looking to heal me
I was walking on one cloudy morning
With uncertain shadow on my soul
Underneath the shadow there was yearning
Ain't it easier to fall
Fall
Walking on the burning coal
As I'm walking on the burning coal
Walking on the burning coal
Walking

When I was younger I lived in fear
That incarceration of some kind is near
I checked my head, in tact with rules
I nearly became a goddamn fool
But I've heard voices not in the head
Out in the air they called ahead
Through ripped out speakers
Through thick and thin
They found a shelter
Under my skin
How many darkest moments and traps
Still lay ahead of us?
Undestructable
How many final frontiers we gonna mount
With maybe no victory laps?
Undestructable
But if you stepped on path of sacred art
And stuck it out through thick and thin
God knows you become one
With undestructable
And so no longer live I in fear
Them are too greedy to pay my asylum bills
This is my life and freedom's my profession
This is my mission throughout all flight duration
There is a core and it's hardcore
All is hardcore when made with love
The love is a voice of a savage soul
This savage love is undestructable
How many darkest moments and traps
Still lay ahead of us?
Undestructable
How many final frontiers we gonna mount
With maybe no victory laps?
Undestructable
But if you stepped on path of sacred art
And stuck it out through thick and thin
God knows you become one
With undestructable
Undestructable!
How many...
Undestructable
How many final frontiers
With maybe no victory laps?
Undestructable
But if you stand on path of sacred art
And stuck it out through thick and thin
God knows you become one

Ох сколько мгновений чёрных
Невозможных
Нам всем предстоит преодолеть
Ох сколько пиров победных впереди
Но всё равно нам не успеть
Но если, если сокровенный путь один -
Ты будешь несокрушим

What was here now is gone
Up and down, like everyone
Walked the earth in lonesome cry
But when the sun comes up
When the sun comes up
It will be on your side
It will be on your side
To the song of wheels
All demons die
Rays of joy, they multiply
Harmony, you will be my bride
But when the sun comes up
I'll let out last breath
And slumber softly into the death
My half-breed odyssey
Your orphan prophecy
Our destiny we will not hide
When the sun comes up
When the sun comes up
It will be on your side
It will be on our side
When the sun comes up
I'll let out last breath

60 revolutions per minute
This is my regular speed
So how do you want me to live with it?
How do you want me to live with it?
Without ringing all alarms!
Without overthrowing tzars!
Without emptying the bars!
Without screwing with your charts!
60 revelations per minute
This is my regular need
So how do you want me to live with it?
How do you want me to live with it?
Without ringing all alarms!
Without overthrowing tzars!
Without emptying the bars!
Without screwing with your charts!
I'm gathering new generation
That's gonna stand up to it
To this karaoke
Karaoke dictatorship
Where posers and models with guitars
Boogie to the shit for beats
I make a better rock revolution
Alone with my dick!
Si lo mueve como lo bate, qué rico el chocolate
No esperarás que por alguien me mate
Si lo mueve como lo bate, qué rico el chocolate
No esperarás que por alguien me mate
Without ringing all alarms!
Without overthrowing tzars!
Without emptying the bars!
Without screwing with your charts!
60 por minuto es mi reputación
Y no te estoy hablando yo de revolución
Hace mucho tiempo que yo ya no te decía
Basta de injusticia, muerte y policía
Pese a lo que digan ya está todo arreglado
Digas lo que digas ya te mandan deportado
El que tiene impone y sobre la ley dispone
Mientras que el pobre es pobre
Pobre pobre pobre y otro se la come

Sally was a fifteen year old girl from Nebraska
Gypsies were passing through her little town
They dropped something on the road, she picked it up...
And cultural revolution right away begun!
Oh no, cultural revolution just begun
Oh no, cultural revolution just begun
They always were afraid that I was schizophrenic...
They always were afraid что родину продал
А по правде я был просто маленький медведик
Сел на велосипедик и все нахуй проебал...
Oh no, cultural revolution just begun
Oh no, cultural revolution just begun
О, да, да, да

From all the tables of contents that Mother Earth provides
I'd like to be a big fat fucking fly
The one that spins around your head all day and all night
And sound of it is just like a what?...
...but by the accident of some kind divine dispensation
I ended up being walking United Nation
And I survive even fucking radiation
