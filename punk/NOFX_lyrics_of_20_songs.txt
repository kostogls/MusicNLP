Where are all the stupid people from?
And how'd they get to be so dumb?
Bred on purple mountain range
Feed amber waves of grains
To lesser human beings, zero feelings
Blame it on
Human nature, mans destiny (mans destiny)
Blame it on the greediocracy (greediocracy)
Fear of God
The fear of change
The fear of truth
Add the Bill of Rights, subtract the wrongs
There's no answers
Memorize and sing star spangled songs
When the questions
Aren't ever asked
Is anybody learning from the past?
We're living in united stagnation
Father what have I done?
I took that .22
A gift to me from you
To bed with me each night
Kept it clean
Polished it well
Cherished every cartridge, every shell
Down, by the creek, under brush, under dirt
There's a carcass of my second kill
Down, by the park, under stone, under pine
There's a carcass of my brother William
Brother where, have you gone to?
I swear, I never thought I could
I see so many times
They told me to shoot straight
Don't pull the trigger, squeeze
That will insure a kill
A kill is what you want
A kill is why we breed
The Christians love their guns
The church and NRA
Pray for their salvations
Prey on the lower faiths
The story book's been read
And every line believed
Curriculum's been set
Logic is a threat
Reason searched and seized
Jerry spent some time in Michigan
A twenty year vacation, after all he had a dime
A dime is worth a lot more in Detroit
A dime in California, a twenty dollar fine
Jerry only stayed a couple months
It's hard to enjoy yourself while bleeding out the ass
Asphyxiation is simple and fast
It beats seventeen fun years of being someone's bitch
Don't think (Stay)
Drink your wine (Home)
Watch the fire burn (Be)
His problems not mine (Safe)
Just be that model citizen
I wish I had a schilling
(For each senseless killing)
For every senseless killing
I'd buy a government
America's for sale
And you can get a good deal on it
(A good deal on it)
And make a healthy profit
Or maybe, tear it apart
Start with assumption
That a million people are smart
Smarter than one
Serotonin's gone
She gave up, drifted away
Sara fled, thought process gone
She left her answering machine on
The greeting left spoken sincere
Messages no one will ever hear
Ten thousand messages a day
A million more transmissions lay
Victims of the laissez faire
Ten thousand voices, a hundred guns
A hundred decibels turns to one
One bullet, one empty head
Now with Serotonin gone
The man who used to speak
Performs a cute routine
Feel a little patronized
Don't feel bad
They found a way inside your head
And you feel a bit misled
It's not that they don't care, yeah
The television's put a thought inside your head
Like a Barry Manilow, jingle
I'd like, to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
A symphonic blank stare, yeah
It doesn't make you care (make you care)
Not designed to make you care (make you care)
They're betting you won't care (you won't...)
Place a wager on your greed
A wager on your pride
Why try to beat them when, a million others tried?
We are the whore
Intellectually spayed
We are the queer
Dysfunctionally raised
One more pill to kill the pain
One more pill to kill the pain
One more pill to kill the pain
Living through conformity
One more prayer to keep me safe
One more prayer to keep us warm
One more prayer to keep us safe
There's gonna be a better place
Lost the battle, lost the war
Lost the things worth living for
Lost the will to win the fight
One more pill to kill the pain
Na na na na na
La na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
The going get tough, the tough get debt
Don't pay attention, pay the rent
Next of kins pay for your sins
A little faith should keep us safe
Save us
The human, existence
Is failing, resistance
Essential, the future
Written off, the odds are
Astronomically against us
Only moron and genius
Would fight a losing battle
Against the super ego
When giving in is so damn comforting
And so we go, on with our lives
We know the truth, but prefer lies
Lies are simple, simple is bliss
Why go against tradition when we can
Admit defeat, live in decline
Be the victim of our own design
The status quo, built on suspect
Why would anyone stick out their neck?
Fellow members
Club "We've Got Ours"
I'd like to introduce you to our host
He's got his, and I've got mine
Meet the decline
We are the queer
We are the whore
Ammunition
In the class war
We are worker
We love our queen
We sacrifice
We're soylent green

It's not the right time to be sober
Now the idiots have taken over
Spreading like a social cancer, is there an answer?
Mensa membership conceding
Tell me why and how are all the stupid people breeding
Watson, it's really elementary
The industrial revolution
Has flipped the bitch on evolution
The benevolent and wise are being thwarted, ostracized, what a bummer
The world keeps getting dumber
Insensitivity is standard and faith is being fancied over reason
Darwin's rolling over in his coffin
The fittest are surviving much less often
Now everything seems to be reversing, and it's worsening
Someone flopped a steamer in the gene pool
Now angry mob mentality's no longer the exception, it's the rule
And I'm starting to feel a lot like Charlton Heston
Stranded on a primate planet
Apes and orangutans that ran it to the ground
With generals and the armies that obeyed them
Followers following fables
Philosophies that enable them to rule without regard
There's no point for democracy when ignorance is celebrated
Political scientists get the same one vote as some Arkansas inbred
Majority rule, don't work in mental institutions
Sometimes the smallest softest voice carries the grand biggest solutions
What are we left with?
A nation of god-fearing pregnant nationalists
Who feel it's their duty to populate the homeland
Pass on traditions
How to get ahead religions
And prosperity via simpleton culture
The idiots are taking over
The idiots are taking over
The idiots are taking over

Possessions never meant anything to me
I'm not crazy
Well, that's not true, I've got a bed
And a guitar
And a dog named Bob who pisses on my floor
That's right, I've got a floor
So what? So what? So what?
I've got pockets full of
Kleenex and lint and holes
Where everything important to me
Just seems to fall right down my leg
And onto the floor
My closest friend, linoleum

Linoleum supports my head
Gives me something to believe

That's me on the beachside, combing the sand
Metal meter in my hand
Sporting a pocket full of change
That's me on the street with a violin under my chin
Playing with a grin
Singing gibberish
That's me on the back of the bus
That's me in the cell
That's me inside your head
That's me inside your head
That's me inside your head12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Don't call me white, don't call me white
Don't call me white, don't call me white

The connotation's wearing my nerves thin
Could it be semantics generating the mess we're in?
I understand that language breeds stereotype
But what's the explanation for the malice, for the spite?

Don't call me white, don't call me white
Don't call me white, don't call me white

I wasn't brought here, I was born
Circumcised, categorised, allegiance sworn
Does this mean I have to take such shit for being fair skinned? No!
I ain't a part of no conspiracy, I'm just your average Joe

Don't call me white, don't call me white
Don't call me white, don't call me white

Represents everything I hate
The soap shoved in your mouth to cleanse the mind
A vast majority of sheep
A buttoned collar, starched and bleached
Constricting veins, the blood flow to the brain slows
They're so fucking ordinary white, don't call me white
Oh, we're better off this way
Oh, say what you're gonna say
So go ahead and label me an asshole, 'cause I can
Accept responsibility for what I've done
But not for who I am

Don't call me white
Don't call me white, don't call me white3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hey Kids!
(Hey Dad!)
What do you want to do today?
(We don't know!)
Wanna go to the matinee?
(No!)
Wanna go to the Amusement Park?
(No!)
Wanna go to the punk rock show?
(Yeah! Let's go to the punk rock show!)
Lost in a sea of combat boots
Flush the bouncers with wasted youth
When did punk rock become so safe?
When did the scene become a joke?
The kids who used to live for beer and speed
Now want their fries and coke
Cursing and birds are not allowed
In fact let's keep noise levels down
Must separate the church and skate!
Why don't we put pads on the kids?
Helmets, head gear and mouth pieces!
Then we could pad the floors and walls
Put cameras inside bathroom stalls
We make sure only nice bands play
Make every show a matinee
Teach kids to be all they can be
And we could sing my country tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
When did punk rock become so safe?
I know it wasn't Duane or Fletcher
Who put up the barricades
Like a stake in the heart
Somehow we got driven apart
I want conflict! I want dissent!
I want the scene to represent
Our hatred of authority
Our fight against complacency
Stop singing songs 'bout girls and love!
You killed the owl! You freed the dove!
Confrontation and politics
Replaced with harmonies and shticks
When did punk rock become so tame?
These fucking bands all sound the same
We want our fights we want our thugs!
We want our burns we want our drugs!
Where is the violent apathy?!
These fucking records are rated G!
When did punk rock become so safe?!5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I never thought about the universe, it made me feel small
Never thought about the problems of this planet at all
Global warming, radioactive sites
Imperialistic wrongs and animal rights! No!

Why think of all the bad things when life is so good?
Why help with an 'am' when there's always a 'could'?
Let the whales worry about the poisons in the sea
Outside of California, it's foreign policy
I don't want changes, I have no reactions
Your dilemmas are my distractions

That's no way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco, Franco Un-American

I never looked around, never second-guessed
Then I read some Howard Zinn now I'm always depressed
And now I can't sleep from years of apathy
All because I read a little Noam Chomsky
I'm eating vegetation, cause of Fast Food Nation
I'm wearing uncomfortable shoes cause of globalization
I'm watching Michael Moore expose the awful truth
I'm listening to Public Enemy and Reagan Youth
I see no world peace cause of zealous armed forces
I eat no breath-mints cause they're from de-hoofed horses
Now I can't believe what an absolute failure
The president's laughing cause we voted for Nader
That's no way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco Un-American
No way to go, Franco Un-American
Where can we go, Franco Un-American

I want to move north and be a Canadian
Or hang down low with the nice Australians
I don't want to be another "I-don't-care"-ican
What are we gonna do Franco, Franco Un-American2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Intellectual property never meant anything to me
So, I’m not crazy for trying to pimp out a classic song
At 25 years old it's the humane thing to do
Even though you know we know you think it's wrong
But after 700 covers and 1800 shows
And because it’s the song that Colombians love to hum
We voted to pull the plug and euthanize "Linoleum"
I think I was born into this world just to piss people off
So I'm doing what no smart band ever would
I’m taking our one well known song and trying to make it not very good
Linoldlium never meant anything to me
I never even wrote a chorus
Just verses and a bridge
It's like bulldozing a bowling alley for a used record store
Decomposing your best song is sacrilege
But when most Hopeless bands play it wrong
And it's in Le Tigre's best song
And it was the last song that Tony ever played
It's time to put Linoleum out to stud and make sure that it gets laid
That's me and I got a new kitchen floor
But I still sleep with a close friend
The leather trunk next to my bed
That's me on the street and I'm walking with my kid
When she told me she knows everything I did
Because she just finished our book
What? Wait. What?
What the fuck?
What the hell?
Why did she feel the need to tell me
That she knows her dad is more than kinda weird
She knows that I do drugs
She knows that I'm kinky
But what keeps me up at night is that her and her friends know that I drink pee

Not that there's anything wrong with that1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I was a misanthrope on the end of a rope
I spent 20 years 6 years on dope
Takin’ a piss while givin’ up hope
I lived a lifetime 6 years on dope
I was a human trash can (Shortening my lifespan)
Live fast die tan (I think that was the plan)
Savin’ all my money for a one-way ticket to Afghanistan
I was a ezoobeson drunk, (strung out on junk)
Live fast die punk (I thought I was sunk)
From gin-swilling and fish tank penicillin
I was a moron bro with impetigo
A pleased as punch Dog Patch Wino
Casual sex and herpes complex
Now I’m on Interferon and Valtrex
I was a child-adult, a walking insult
Every shot got more difficult
I was a teenage trash bin (a breathing mannequin)
A caustic cause (who musta loved sufferin')
Do pinhole eyes romanticize heroin?
I was a moron bro, a circus sideshow
A dying slow Dog Patch WinoEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Going out to terrorize Goyim

As long as we're home by Saturday morning

'Cause hey, we're the Brews

I walked into The Eagle and someone called me cis
I said I'm not a cis, I'm a sissy, should I call you Mister or Miss?
I said I'm actually a transvest, but before I got to tite
The place erupted into my first gender, pronoun bar fight

They said I was a Ross crossdress for less wannabe queer
I said my gender isn't fluid, but that's how I like my beer
They thought I was just posing or on a publicity stunt
Until I did a line off Scarlett's hundred thousand dollar cunt

She paid a hundred thousand clams for a single clam in front
A very pricey pussy paid for by the government

Then I said fuck euphemism, cis butt fuck my cis clit
Your hypocritical political correctness ain't legit
I mean it, fuck euphemism, I say what I wanna say
I love that LBGTQ will never include K

'Cause they say that unlike cis queers kinksters make a choice
They're wrong, but yes, we choose which gag to take away our voice
I identify as a grain of saltpeter panarchist
Or a poly rubber puppy switch brat slut Dharmasochist
So I said fuck euphemism, your words are neophyte
I'm a single, not a plural person, so call me per for the night
You're wrong if you hate me just 'cause I'm a word Smith and Wesson
'Cause I nicked this terminology from a Doris Lessing lessonEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

One morning I woke up
Scratched my balls and eyes
I looked into the mirror
And got a big surprise
I don't know who this person is
But I've seen his face before
A face I don't want to have to face
I don't think I like me anymore

When I run into old friends
Their eyes seem to dart away
I wish I could remember
All the shitty things I say
Then one day my best friend said something
I'd never heard before
You've done so much for me
And I love you
But I don't like you anymore

Someone lock the door
I don't like me anymore
And here comes media whore
I heard this story twice before
I don't like me anymore
Pop punks claiming hardcore
I don't like me anymore
Was it something that I've done?
Was it something that I've said?
Was I having too much fun?
Did I dropkick someone's head?
I turn on the TV
And I don't like what I see
There's an old punk rocker acting like a jerk
And that jerk looks a lot like me

Someone lock the door
I don't like me anymore
And here comes media whore
I heard this story twice before
I don't like me anymore
Pop punk claiming hardcore
I don't like me anymore

Catastrophe uncertain
Hit the lights and drop the curtain
Organize a mob and rush the door

Peel me off the floor
I don't like me anymore
A burning open sore
I don't like me anymore
People say they love me
Then ask for something more
The never-ending story
A filibustering bore
A pompous dinosaur
I don't like me anymore
Why does being nice to people
Feel like such a chore?
I'm paid to be your clown but
Feel like anybody's whore
A somber fact I wish I could ignore
I don't like me anymore4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

He spent fifteen years getting loaded
Fifteen years until his liver exploded
Now what's Bob gonna do
Now that he can't drink?
The doctor said, "What'cha been thinking about?"
Bob said, "That's the point
I wanna think about nothing
Now I gotta do something else -"

Oi, oi, oi!

"- to pass the time,"
Had someone shave his head
He got a new identity
Sixty-two holed air-cushioned boots
And a girl who rides a scooter
To take him out
Of town
They would get away, riding around
As the trucks drive by
You can hear the motherfuckers go -

A couple of lines, an extra thermos of joe
He'll be kicking in heads at the punk rock show
Bob's the kind of guy who knows just what
Bob's the kind of guy who knows just what to do
When the doctor tells him to:
"Quit your drinking, now's the time"
But will he ever walk the line?
To all my friends, "I feel just great"
Will he ever walk the line?
Kicking ass and busting heads
Red suspenders
Once a day he shaves his head
But will he ever walk the line?
Will he ever walk the line?
Will he ever walk the line?
Will he ever walk the line?
Will he ever walk the line?

We call the heartland
Not very smart land
IQ's are very low but threat levels are high
They got a mandate
They don't want man-dates
They got so many hates and people to despise
In the dust bowl
Cerebral black hole
The average weight is well over 200 pounds
I hate to generalize
But have you seen the thighs
Most haven't seen their genitalia in a while

Maybe that's why they're so scared of us
We've concerns others than fear  and hunger pangs
Queers, transgends, and lesbians
Vegans and vegetarians
All you brownish red and yellow ones
Come out and join us on the coast
No longer svelte
They gotta punch new holes in the Bible belt
They've blown out the fire
Under the melting pot
The red blood of America is starting to clot
No compromise
No sight through others' eyes
They're just flies spreading pieces of shit
You gotta emigrate
Stop living in hate
What makes this country great is dwelling on either side

They don't want visitors in Jesusland
They want life bland and canned in the fatherland
We want people with college degrees
Drug use experience and STD's
People with open-minded philosophies
Come hug California trees
Cultural revolution now
Neo-conservatives run outta town
We're gonna burn Orange County down
And then we're off to Riverside
Bakersfield and Fresno too
Then we're comin' after you

Born again Christian
They got a vision, a homogenized state
Textbook decline
Intelligent design
They got Bill Nye on the list to execrate

They don't want visitors in Jesusland
They want life bland and canned in the fatherland
Punk Rockers and emo kids
People doin' things the church forbids
Buddhists, agnostics, and atheists
We're moving out of jesusland

Excluding country, all the musicians
We want all hookers and comedians

I've been called an OxyMoron
Because I question which drugs our war's on
Why are there more drug stores
Than liquor stores you can score on
The healers have become the harmers
They're just pharmaceutical farmers
What we used to call dealers
We now call doctors
I might be a CDCynic
Cause that crack house is now a clinic
It's time they change the name of the oath to
The hypocritic or the parasitic
It isn't Adderalltruistic
By over prescribing
How can we fight them in a Suboxone ring
I'll throw a Prozacuzation
With a sub-Ketamine-ing
They'll say my fears are Quaaludacris
They should be Ativanishing
With every Demeroltercation
They'll have a good Xanaxplanation
You're just Cialistrated
Cause we made your dick deflated
It's OxyMoronic
It's OxyMoronic
It should be doctors getting busted
For their Klonopinions we trusted
We're not the sinners

That served us the Vicodinners
I don't want to be an alarmist
But in that harmacy there's a harmacist
And those scripts are making us Paximple minded pacifists

I think that our kids will probably see the end of humanity
As we know it, cause this world’s about to blow it
Will they see what they saw in ancient Rome
The destruction of the home?
Will they see the end of civility?
Cause when morality’s been blurred, procreation seems absurd
And human rights and freedom are just words
That have lost all their meaning
In a world that is bleating like an animal at slaughter
I hope that my daughters never know what it feels like to give up
To know the whole world is corrupt
To realize that they are really on their own
And there’s no one left who cares about the future
Infected cuts don’t need a suture
There’s a feeling that the human race has seen the checkered flag
And the laps that are given are the last ones ever driven
And everyone who’s still living knows that
It’s a shame that the Earth will live on but can’t give birth
To a baby planet where we could start over again
We've been divided, we've been bled
Like a chicken without a head, running frantically amok
Taking but not giving a fuck
History is just an alibi
It’s believing every lie man has ever dared to write
It’s so much easier to see than complex reality
A lifetime full of misery and blight
So we tell our daughter’s and sons that they’re not the final ones
To see this planet as a decent place to live
We use a telescope to give them faith to give them hope
Anything to help them cope with their future
Cause there’s no alternative
Kings and queens ruled the land
There’s more and more lines drawn in the sand
Pawns are crooks castles are rooks
It’s too bad the good books
Written for the sub-classes to introduce morality
Had nothing to do with reality
But then again who would have ever read them
We read the Par Quran for lunch
Eat Old Testaments for a snack
And read the Lulla-bible before bed
There’s no more points of view
(It’s sad I’m gonna see)
When your only thought is food
The bible has been replaced with a survival guide
(The end of history)
That uses perishables instead of parables
Because there’s no stories left to preach
(We don’t wanna be)
There’s no large lessons left to teach anyone
Why bother?
(The Generation Z)
Who are we
Are we the intellects, or the insects?
(We don’t wanna see)
We’re not the ones who will ever know the answer
It’s impossible for us to imagine what is right in front of us
(A species you and me)
I guess that’s what makes us think we’re human
But being human only lets us see a little farther than animals
(The end of history)
Feel depression from spending most of your life working?
(The Generation Z)
Try chemicals
Chemicals make everything better!
(The end of history)
Hate, love, morality
(The Generation Z)
They’re just chemical reactions
Are we just chemically imbalanced ants
On chemically fueled rants?
It really just comes down to sex and power
I bet the last man standing
The last human on this planet
The last person on the earth
Doesn't give a shit
Or have any idea that he or most likely she
Is the last one
The last person on this planet will fuck the dead
And die thinking not about why didn't anyone care
But why her life was so unfair
It’s time, it needs to be said
I’m sorry to be the one to inform you
But man and womankind has unfortunately been pronounced dead

Like a gutter punk-tuation
In a foreign conversation
I feel like Thoreau at party I throw
I’m a self-made scarecrow
I love you more than I hate me
Cuz you are everything I wish I could be
I'm a friendless best friend
A single bookend, “a walking dead ender”
“I’m a return to sender”
We didn’t know the fix was in
Years before our race was run
Our epilogue was predestine
Like A Maori Tribe 4th son

Like a Randy Rhodes scholar
Or a rotary cell phone
A slave is lost without their collar
The un-favorite sundial tone
My conscience disobeys me
Because I always cease to amaze me
I’m like a vir-gin blossom
I’m on the verge of nawesome
A unhip-hop scotch blend
Where everyone tried to pretend
They didn’t want our love to end
But we all knew that it had to1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Breathe ever so soft
We wouldn't wanna break the eggs as we walk
Never alone, cautious, afraid
I hear the voice of reason on the PA
Leave it alone, follow the grain
We couldn't stop the irresistible force
Leave it the same, change with the leaves
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the old
Leave it alone

Da-na-na na-na na-na na
Da-na-na na-na na-na na
Da-na-na na-na na-na na
Da-na-na na-na na-na na

Breathe ever so slight
We couldn't take away your God given right
Leave it alone, heel and stay
Roll over and shake and beg for the bone
Leave it alone

Da-na-na na-na na-na na
Da-na-na na-na na-na na
Da-na-na na-na na-na na
Da-na-na na-na na-na na2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Does anyone know how loaded he was
When he unloaded his gun?
Does anyone know how loaded he was
When the slaughter had begun?
Does anyone know how crazy he was?
Does anyone think he did it because
He thought humans were in season?
His brain had a lesion?
Is it worse if he didn’t have any reason?
Does anyone know what number of pints
He was planning to spill?
Does anyone think he may have just been prescribed
The wrong happy pill?
Which god told him to kill all the infidels?
The intellectuals, the homosexuals
Even the red-nexuals
Anything can start making sense
When it's imprinted out of context
Does anyone know what made him decide
To unload his first round?
Do you think he cared what race or faith
For the victims he left for dead on the ground?
Does anyone know how Jewish he was?
Does anyone know how Buddish he was?
Does anyone know how if he's a Christian?
Had a pot to piss in? Did he consider it a sin?
Did anyone go to church for the dead
And ask to kneel and pray?
How can you believe in a God
And still carry a card of the NRA?
I thought religion is supposed to instill
A notion that it's not right to kill
It must be a bitter pill
To admit that you're all mentally ill
Why do we have a harder time
When there's no enemy to blame?
It doesn't matter how many were killed
The debate is the same
Is it alright to hunt or judge you for fun?
Is it protection we need from the gun?
The blame is always placed on someone
It's always how the story is spun
Only a lunatic
Would sell a lunatic a gun3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
