I'm living on shattered faith
The kind that likes to restrict your breath
Never been a better time than this to
Suffocate on eternal bliss

In a city that swells with so much hate
You seem to rise above and take its place
The heart pumps until it dies
Drain the blood, the heart is wise

All my friends are murder
Hey, all my bones, no marrows in
All these fiends want teenage meat
All my friends are murderers away, yeah

I never met a pearl quite like you
Who could shimmer and rot at the same time through
There's never been a better time than this and
Bite the hand of the frostbitten eminence

All my friends are murder
Hey, all my bones, no marrows in
All these fiends want teenage meat
All my friends are murderers away, away, away, yeah
Oh whoa oh
Oh whoa whoa whoa
Oh, whoa oh
(Oh whoa oh) I'm alive in uterine
A stab in the dark, a new day has dawned
(Oh whoa whoa whoa)

I'll make it yours, so here we go

All my friends are murder

It's going down
Tonight in this town
Cause they stare and growl
They all stare and growl
I take a scar
Everytime I cry
Cause it ain't my style
No, it ain't my style
Going down to the gravel head to the barrel
Take this life and end this struggle
Los Angeles, come scam me please
Emptiness never sleeps at Cliftons 6am
With your bag lady friend and your mind descending
Stripped of the right to be a human in control
It's warmer in hell so down we go

They say
This is the city
The city of angels
All I see is dead wings

It's a ghost town rabid underworld
Dionysian night vitriolic twilight
A mirage come up it never ends
Once you get born you're never the same
Left behind erased from time
Ain't no decency in being boxed up alive
Look around ain't no R.I.P signs here
We don't rest in peace, we just disappear
So here we are Los Angeles
No angels singing in your valley of unease
I watch the sun roll down the pacific
Over hooked sunset strip

They say
This is the city
The city of angels
All I see is dead wings

There's a black moon tonight
Shining down on the western neon lights
There's a black moon tonight

Holy eyes
I never knew I'd beg down at your feet
Hold on tight
I never knew I'd know much more than this
Open sky
The wave of pain, the scent of you is bliss
Hungry eyes
They stare at me, I know, I know, don't go!

Summertime
The taste of saint secretes of perfume mist
Console the mind
I take it in, the lips of pink, I kiss
Lonely sky
The more you take, the more that I give in
Holy eyes
I never knew, I know, I know, don't go!

Hold on to the memory
Yeah, it's all you got
I know you'll be there
To soak up blood lost
Blood lost, blood lost

Are you ready to be liberated
On this sad side city street?
Well, the birds have been freed from their cages
I got freedom and my youth

My name is Brody, I'm from Melbourne
Fitzroy Melbourne, Fitzroy Melbourne
I grew up on Bell Street, then on Bennett Street
My mom kicked out my dad for battery
Found a way, she found a way
She found a way out of spiritual penury
Working single mother in an urban struggle
Blames herself now ’cause I grew up troubled

It hit me
I got everything I need
It hit me
I got everything I need

My one heart felt too much from the start
I've seen people come and go, living large and living low
You can build up your walls sitting on death row
Let the curtain fall on your murdered soul
You can wash it all down, swallow your story
Get smacked off your head, go down in drumroll glory
You won't solve it committing self-inflicted crime
Go on, pull the trigger, this will be the last time

So...

I speak of the truth, the truth of the heart
Like a desperate thirst in a raging drought
Hey youth, time flies by
There's an everlasting battle for eternal life
I love a man from California
He's the prettiest thing, we got the same disorder
The way you feel is okay
It's never gonna change anyway

It hit me
I got everyone I need
It hit me
I got everyone I need

Are you ready to be liberated
On this sad side city street?
Well, the birds have been freed from their cages
I got freedom and my youth
Yeah, I got freedom and my youthEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Another year has passed and I'm all right
I lick the salt from my wounds and run into the night
Well, it's unknown
Why collusion goes on
It rapes like betrayal
And I am rotting in the squalor of some

Do you remember the rage?
I remember the hate
I remember that it rained for years
And the blood had left a stain
Hey!

You say I got karma to collect
I dig my grave
And I'm here waiting for some kind of check
And if I get one, I'll hold my breath
I rack my spine
It takes a year for you to warrant a test
As the years go by, I won't cry
It's the year you walked into my life
I will despise
 x2
We are the revenants, whoa-oh
We will rise up from the dead
We become the living
We've come back to reclaim our stolen breath

Murder murder a ripe fucking hate
Pulled the fucking trigger cause Im sick of it all
I went to school today with an oozi
There's this kid he teased me so i shot em in the face
All the worlds light won't ease my pain
It won't cease im diseased will you hang me please
I'm a nihilist raised on violence
What do i do im american youth
All my life ive lived in silence
Im gonna snap I'll get you back
Im a girl
I'm only 13
My body rots
Cause i won't fucking eat
Im a silent star on a b-roll
Im a mirror fucking image of no control
Give me the award i conquered food again
What else is better in life than to purge my pain
If i cut, i won't look like that
If i cut if i cut i won't feel like this shit
We are kids we think life is a scam
We come from wasted land
We are kids we play punk rock and roll

We got one pulse running through the streets

Everybody knows your name
You leave a lasting impression
Not a moment I don't love your imperfection
You left to wake up in some dark dimension

Looking for it, dare to hurt us
Hanging when you run

I'll be on the run
Gone until I'm found
Chasing better dreams
Repeat myself to sleep

I don't want to live forever
Don't wanna die at all
Found out what your love is made of
Not the same as mine

I will not run, that's what you want
Merely endless blood
I'll be on the run
Gone until I'm found
Chasing better dreams
Repeat myself to sleep

Oh, I've been caught

Feelings born in the light
Blood in gutters and you make it right

Find your weakness and kill it

Morphine angels on their way
And the tears and the wrong stair falls away
I wish I could say I'd stay

Find your weakness and kill it
Carry on and passion flies

I'm leaving this life and my love behind
It’s time to go and say goodbye
Take your dreams and run into the sun
Take your dreams and run

Acerbic heart ain't nothing pure in here
I keep the memories of a broken you
Sing sing the stories of a fractured few
I believe I will open up
For all my rage will surely come undone

I am agnostic but I hang on a cross
Faithless saintless my sin stabs
I wear the crown of oblivion
Rule and aching void watch my sun burn out
