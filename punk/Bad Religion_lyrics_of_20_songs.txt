I don't need to be a global citizen
'Cause I'm blessed by nationality
I'm a member of a growing populace
We enforce our popularity
There are things that seem to pull us under, and
There are things that drag us down
But there's a power and a vital presence
That's lurking all around

We've got the American Jesus
See him on the interstate
We've got the American Jesus
He helped build the president's estate

I feel sorry for the earth's population
'Cause so few live in the U.S.A
At least the foreigners can copy our morality
They can visit, but they cannot stay
Only precious few can garner the prosperity
It makes us walk with renewed confidence
We've got a place to go when we die
And the architect resides right here
We've got the American Jesus (Ah)
Bolstering national faith (Ah-ah-ah)
We've got the American Jesus (Ah-ah-ah)
Overwhelming millions every day (Ah-ah)

He's the farmers' barren fields (In God!)
The force the army wields (We trust!)
Expressions on the faces of the starving millions
(Because he's one of us)
The power of the man (Break down!)
The fuel that drives the Klan (Cave in!)
He's the motive and the conscience of the murderer
(We can redeem your sin)
He's the preacher on T.V. (Strong heart!)
The false sincerity (Clear mind!)
The form letter that's written by the big computers
(And infinitely kind)
The nuclear bombs (You lose!)
The kids with no moms (We win!)
And I'm fearful that he's inside me
(He is our champion) Yeah!

We've got the American Jesus
(We've got the American Jesus)
See him on the interstate
(We've got the American Jesus)
We've got the American Jesus
(We've got the American Jesus)
Exercising his authority
We've got the American Jesus
(We've got the American Jesus)
Bolstering national faith
(We've got the American Jesus)
We've got the American Jesus

There's a place where everyone can be happy
It's the most beautiful place in the whole fucking world
It's made of candy canes and planes and bright red choo choo trains
And the meanest little boys, the most innocent little girls
And, you know, I wish that I could go there
It's a road that I have not found
And I wish you the best of luck, dear
So drop a card or letter to my side of town

'Cause there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend
But baby, I'm amazed at the hate that you can send

And you painted my entire world
But I don't have the turpentine to clean what you have soiled
And I won't forget it

There's a place where everyone can be right
Even though you remain determined to be opposed
Admittance requires no qualifications
It's where everyone has been and where everybody goes
So please try not to be impatient
For we all hate standing in line
And when the farm is good and bought, you'll be there without a thought
And eternity, my friend, is a long fucking time
As there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend
But baby, I'm amazed at the hate that you can send

And you painted my entire world
But I don't have the turpentine to clean what you have soiled
And I won't forget it5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Father, can you hear me?
How have I let you down?
I curse the day that I was born
And all the sorrow in this world

Let me take you to the herding ground
Where all good men are trampled down
Just to settle a bet that could not be won
Between a prideful father and his son
Will you guide me, now, for I can't see
A reason for the suffering and this long misery
What if every living soul could be upright and strong?
Well then I do imagine

There will be sorrow
Yeah, there will be sorrow
And there will be sorrow no more

When all soldiers lay their weapons down
Or when all kings and all queens relinquish their crowns
Or when the only true messiah rescues us from ourselves
It's easy to imagine

Hey Brother Christian with your high and mighty errand
Your actions speak so loud, I can't hear a word you're saying
Hey Sister Bleeding Heart with all of your compassion
Your labors soothe the hurt, but can't assuage temptation

Hey man of science with your perfect rules of measure
Can you improve this place with the data that you gather?
Hey Mother Mercy, can your loins bear fruit forever?
Is your fecundity a trammel or a treasure?

And I want to conquer the world
Give all the idiots a brand new religion
Put an end to poverty, uncleanliness, and toil
Promote equality in all of my decisions

With a quick wink of the eye
And a "God you must be joking!"

Hey Mr. Diplomat with your worldly aspirations
Did you see your children cry when you left them at the station?
Hey moral soldier, you've got righteous proclamations
And precious tomes to fuel your pulpy conflagrations

And I want to conquer the world
Give all the idiots a brand new religion
Put an end to poverty, uncleanliness, and toil
Promote equality in all of my decisions
I want to conquer the world
Expose the culprits and feed them to the children
Do away with air pollution and then I'll save the whales
We'll have peace on earth and global communion

I want to conquer the world!

Everybody needs a slogan in their pocket or two
It never hurts to have a strategy you can go to
Sometimes I have no sense at all
As most flawed men are won't to do
Just say fuck you
Pavlovian rude
A menace too
Pay homage to
Your bad attitude
You can even get cerebral if you want to
Make a radical assessment that sticks like glue
Sometimes it takes no thought at all
The easiest thing to do
Is say fuck you
Pavlovian rude
A menace too
Pay homage to
Your bad attitude
The reaction it brings, just one of those things
Your friends might not want you around
If the impulse is right you might get in a fight
Even though you can't hold your ground
But all rest assured, sometimes just a word
Is the most satisfying sound
Sometimes it makes no sense at all

Culture was the seed of proliferation but it's gotten melded
Into an inharmonic whole, to an inharmonic whole
Consciousness has plagued us and we cannot shake it
Though we think we're in control, though we think we're in control

Questions that besiege us in life are testament
Of our helplessness

There's no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end
When we all disintegrate it will all happen again, yeah

Time is so rock solid in the minds of the hordes but they can't
Explain why it should slip away, explain why it should slip away
History and future are the comforts of our curiosity but here we are
Rooted in the present day, rooted in the present day

Questions that besiege us in life are testament
Of our helplessness

There's no vestige of beginning, no prospect of an end
When we all disintegrate it will all happen again, yeah
If you came to conquer, you'll be king for a day
But you too will deteriorate and quickly fade away
And believe these words you hear when you think your path is clear...

A febrile shocking violent smack
And the children are hoping for a heart-attack
Tonight the windows are watching, the streets all conspire
And the lamppost can't stop crying
If I could fly high above the world
Would I see a bunch of living dots spell the word "stupidity?"
Or would I see hungry lover homicides, loving brother suicides
And olly olly oxen frees who pick a side and hide?

(Ah-ah-ah) The world is scratching at my door
(Ah-ah-ah) My morning paper's got the scores
(Ah, ah, ah) The human interest stories
And the obituary, oh yeah

Cockroach naps, rattling traps
How many devils can you fit upon a match head?
Caringosity killed the Kerouac cat
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction

In my alley 'round the corner, there's a wino with feathered shoulders
And a spirit giving head for crack and he'll never want it back
There's a little kid and his family eating crackers like Thanksgiving
And a pack of wild desperadoes scornful of living
(Ah-ah-ah) The world is scratching at my door
(Ah-ah-ah) My morning paper has the scores
(Ah, ah, ah) The human interest stories
And the obituary, oh yeah

Cradle for a cat, Wolfe looks back
How many angels can you fit upon a match?
I wanna know why Hemingway cracked

Just a lot of cheap shots, pictures to shock
And characters an amateur would never dream up

When the world has gone mad
And there's nowhere to roam
The lights are all on
But nobody’s home
There comes a time
When you look up to the sky
And ask, "Why do my favorite songs
Always make me cry?"

And am I losing

My sanity? My sanity?
I've nothing to lose, so please let me be
I've got a firm grip and strong roots like a tree
Burrowed deep in reality
I won’t let you go, what else can there be?
You're all I have

When you swore to be true (Ooh, ooh)
Our bed was belief
But alternative facts
Snuck in like a thief
There comes a time
To release the cord of self
And with confidence, declare your state of
Perfect mental health
Never doubting

My sanity, my sanity
I've nothing to lose, so please let me be
My life is a song, a short melody
Harmonizing with reality
I've got it real bad, there's no remedy
You're all I have, my dear sanity

Sometimes there's no sane reason
For optimism


Oh, my sanity, my sanity
I've nothing to lose, so please let me be
My life is a song, a short melody
Harmonizing with reality
I’ve got it real bad, there’s no remedy
My world picture is exemplary

Just to think that not so long ago
Was a man who risked his life
Who challenged all the lies offered as sacred truth
Just to cast a brighter light

The notion that we
Can live as one in perfect harmony
Requires a common sensibility
To teach an intellectual capacity that I believe
Is in the air, but everywhere
Is the ultimate act of treason
How so few could be aware
That their nation's heart is bleeding

But oh, when the violence has begun
We decree the pen more mighty than the gun
While the fools believe as one
In this unrepentant age of unreason

Just to think that not so long ago
Was a man who received the seal
He peddled blatant lies and brought back tyranny
To divide his people with zeal
But we can live as one in perfect harmony
It requires a common sensibility
To teach an intellectual capacity that I believe
Is in the air, but everywhere
Is the ultimate act of treason
How so few could be aware
That their nation's heart is bleeding

But oh, as a child who plays for fun
With his eye up to the barrel of a gun
Watchin' fools believe as one
In this unrepentant age of unreason
Now that darkness has begun
We decree the pen more mighty than the gun
Watch the fools believe as one
In this unrepentant age of unreason

Did you ever see the concrete
Stares of everyday?
The lunatic, the hypocrite
Are all lost in the fray

Can't you see their lives are just like yours?
An unturned stone, an undiscovered door leading to
The gift of hope renewed, eternity for you
The masses of humanity have always had to suffer

The businessman whose master plan
Controls the world each day
Is blind to indications of
His species' slow decay

Can't you see his life is just like yours?
An unturned stone, an undiscovered door leading to
The gift of hope renewed, eternity for you
The masses of humanity have always had to suffer

People blow their minds, they choose to resign
This deformed society is part of the design
It'll never go away, it's in the cards that way
The masses of humanity have always, always had to suffer
A door leading to
The gift of hope renewed, eternity for you
The masses of humanity still clinging to their dignity
The masses of humanity will always have to suffer

Somewhere high in the desert, near a curtain of blue
Saint Ann's skirts are billowing
But down here in the city of limelights
The fans of Santa Ana are withering
And you can't deny that living is easy
If you never look behind the scenery
It's showtime for dry climes
And Bedlam is dreaming of rain

When the hills of Los Angeles are burning
Palm trees are candles in the murder wind
So many lives are on the breeze
Even the stars are ill at ease
And Los Angeles is burning

This is not a test
Of the emergency broadcast system
Where Malibu fires and radio towers
Conspire to dance again
And I cannot believe the media Mecca
They're only trying to peddle reality
Catch it on prime time, story at 9
The whole world is going insane
When the hills of Los Angeles are burning
Palm trees are candles in the murder wind
So many lives are on the breeze
Even the stars are ill at ease
And Los Angeles is burning

A placard reads, "The end of days"
Jacaranda boughs are bending in the haze
More a question than a curse
How could hell be any worse?
The flames are starting
The camera's running
So take warning
