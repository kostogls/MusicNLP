You make me feel I'm dirt, and I'm hurt
And if I start a commotion
I run the risk of losing you, and that's worse

Ever fallen in love with someone?
Ever fallen in love? In love with someone
Ever fallen in love? In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with?

I can't see much of the future
Unless we find out what's to blame, what a shame
And we won't be together much longer
Unless we realize that we are the same

Ever fallen in love with someone?

Ever fallen in love? In love with someone

You make me feel I'm dirt, and I'm hurt

Well you tried it just for once, find it alright for kicks
But now you found out that it's a habit that sticks

And you're an orgasm addict
You're an orgasm addict

Sneakin' in the back door with dirty magazines
And your mother wants to know "What are those stains on your jeans?"

And you're an orgasm addict
You're an orgasm addict

Uh-huh, uh-huh, ah
Ah, ah, ah

You get in a heat, you get in a sulk
But you still keep on beatin' your meat to pulp

And you're an orgasm addict
You're an orgasm addict
You're a kid Casanova, you're a no-Joseph
It's a labour of love, fucking yourself to death

Orgasm addict
You're an orgasm addict

Uh-huh, uh-huh, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

You're makin' out with school kids
Winos and heads of state
You've even made it with the lady
Who puts the little plastic robins on the Christmas cakes
Butcher's assistants and bellhops
You've had 'em all, here and there
Children of God and their joy strings
International women with no body hair

Ooh, so well, you're asking in an alley and your voice ain't steady
The sex mechanic's rough, you're more than ready
You're an orgasm addict
You're an orgasm addict

Johnnie want fuckie, all ways, and always
He's got the energy, he will amaze

He's an orgasm addict
He's an orgasm addict

He's always at it
He's always at it
And he's an orgasm addict

Reality's a dream (O-o-o-ooh)
A game in which I seem to never find out just what I am
I don't know if I'm an actor or ham, a shaman or sham

But if you don't mind, I don't mind

I'm lost without a clue (O-o-o-ooh)
So how can I undo the tangle of these webs I keep weaving?
I don't know if I should be believing, deceptive perceiving

But if you don't mind, I don't mind

I used to bet that you didn't care (O-o-oh)
But gambling never got me anywhere (O-o-oh)
Each time, I used to feel so sure (O-oh)
Something about you made me doubt you more (O-oh)

How can you convince me? (O-o-o-ooh)
When everything I see just makes me feel you're putting me down?
And if it's true, this pathetic clown'll keep hanging around (A-a-ah)

And sometimes when we go out, then, I wish I'd stayed at home
And when I'm dreaming, or just lying in my bed
I think you've got it in for me, is it all in my head?
Is it in my head?

Whenever I'm in doubt about things I do
I listen to the high street wailing sounds in a queue
I go out for my walking, sailing social news
Don't let it get me down, I'm long in the tooth
When I'm out in the open, clattering shoppers around
The neon signs that take your eyes to town
Your thoughts are chosen, your world is advertising now
And extravagance matters to worshipers of the pound

But it's a harmony in my head, it's a harmony in my head

The tortured faces, expressions out aloud
And life's little ironies seem so obvious now
Your cashed in checks have placed the payments down
And there's a line of buses, all wait to take you out

But it's a harmony in my head, it's a harmony in my head

It's a...

In these times of contention, it's not my intention to make things plain
I'm looking through mirrors to cast a reflection that can't be mine
I'm losing control now, I'll just have to slow down a thought or two
I can't feel the future, and I'm not even certain that there is a past

I believe in the worker's revolution
And I believe in the final solution
I believe in, I believe in
I believe in the shape of things to come
And I believe I'm not the only one
Yes, I believe in, I believe in

When I poison my system, I take thoughts and twist them into shapes
I'm reaching my nadir, and I haven't an idea of what to do
I'm painting by numbers, but can't find the colours that fill you in
I'm not even knowing if I'm coming or going, if to end or begin

I believe in the immaculate conception
And I believe in the resurrection
And I believe in, I believe in
I believe in the elixir of youth
And I believe in the absolute truth
Yes, I believe in, I believe in
There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore

I've fallen from favour while trying to savour experience
I'm seeing things clearly, but it has quite nearly blown my mind
It's the aim of existence to offer resistance to the flow of time
Everything is, and that is why it is, will be the line

I believe in perpetual motion
And I believe in perfect devotion
I believe in, I believe in
I believe in the things I've never had
I believe in my mum and my dad
And I believe in, I believe in

There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore

I'm skipping the pages of a book that takes ages for the foreword to end
Triangular cover concealing another aspect from view
My relative motion is just an illusion from stopping too fast
The essence of being, these feelings I'm feeling, I just want them to last
I believe in original sin
And I believe what I believe in
Yes, I believe in, I believe in
I believe in the web of fate
And I believe I'm going to be late
So I'll be leavin' what I believe in

There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore

Feeling like I'm almost 16 again
Layin' 'round, doing nothing like all my friends
Play it cool, don't get angry, count up to 10
Just like I was 16 again
No one gets the lowdown right from the start
Everybody gets the showdown, right from the heart
But that's all that's on the menu, and life's à la carte
I don't know

Things in life are not played for keeps
If it makes you happy, it'll make you weep
And if you want some more practical advice
If you can't think once, then don't think twice
'cause things won't seem so nice
You'll wish you were 16 again, oh no

Feeling rather strange when you're 16 again
Things don't seem the same, the past is so plain
This future is our future, this time's not a game
The time you're 16 again
Always on your own when there's nobody else
Asking myself "Would I be someone else?"
But after all, life's only death's recompense

Look at me, here I am for your eyes
Mirrored proof of what you recognize

And I know you won't treat me right till I do
But at least we'll know it's true

I bet that you love me like I love you
But I should know that gambling just don't pay
So I look up to the sky
And I wonder what it'll be like in days gone by
As I sit and bathe in the wave of nostalgia for an age yet to come
I always used to dream of the past
But like they say, yesterday never comes
Sometimes there's a song in my brain
And I feel that my heart knows the refrain
I guess it's just the music that brings on nostalgia for an age yet to come

Ah, nostalgia for an age yet to come
Nostalgia for an age yet to come

About the future, I only can reminisce
For what I've had is what I'll never get
And although this may sound strange
My future and my past are presently disarranged
And I'm surfing on a wave of nostalgia for an age yet to come
I look, I only see what I don't know
All that was strong, invincible, is slain
Takes more than sunshine to make everything fine
And I feel like I'm trapped in the middle of time
And this constant feeling of nostalgia for an age yet to come
Ah, nostalgia for an age yet to come

About the future, I only can reminisce

A fiction romance, I love this love story
That never seems to happen in my life
A fiction romance, all love, and glory
That never seems to happen in my life

Dreams of love, and dreams of pain
And dreams again, again, again, again
Which can be yours just by taking hold
Dreams that I can realize
Are quite contained within your eyes
Say, fiction romance is not so old

A fiction romance, the love of the ages
That never seems to matter in my life
A fiction romance on magazine pages
That never seems to feature in my life

Dreaming, scheming, unaware that
Quiet somewhere, some unaware folk
Are not thinking 'bout what they have been told
Something strange is happening to
The way I see the world I view
That fiction romance is not sold
As a fiction romantic, I never expected
All these things to happen in real life
And no fiction romantic could ever've predicted
All the things that happen in my life

When I don't know what to do
I just think about me and you
If I was a little stronger then I'd be bold
Something strange is happening to me
I don't know what these shivers mean to you
Is this the fiction kind of romance getting hold?

A fiction romance, a fiction romance
A fiction romance, a fiction romance
A fiction romance, a fiction romance
A fiction romance, a fiction romance
