If you wanna make a move then you better come in
It's just the ability to reason that wears so thin
Livin' and dyin' and the stories that are true
Secrets to a good life's knowing when you're through

Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb

Well, he's back in the hole where they got him living
Like a rat but he's smarter than that nine lives
Like a cat fifteen years old take him to the youth authority home
First thing you learn you gotta make it in this world alone

Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb

Now he's gotten out, he gotten free, he gotta go, gotta car
He's twenty-one years old, he's runnin' numbers from the bar
His pager's beepin', he's got in deep in
Whatever he can move on in you know that kid's a creepin'
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
The boy's a time bomb
(Yeah) The boy's a time bomb
Tears come from the razor that's been tattooed below his eye
His mother cries, she knows that he is strong enough to die
He's rollin' in the Cadillac, it's midnight sunroof is down
Three shots rung out the hero's dead, the new king is crowned

Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah! The boy's a time bomb
Ohh, time bomb!2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Echoes of reggae comin' through my bedroom wall
Having a party up next door but I'm sittin here all alone
Two lovers in the bedroom and the other starts to shout
All I got is this blank stare and that don't carry no clout at all

Destination unknown

He's singing and she's there to lend a hand
He's seen his name on the marquee but she will never understand
Once again he's leavin' and she's there with a tear in her eye
Embraces with a warm gesture it's time, time to say goodbye

Ruby's heart ain't beatin' cause she knows the feelin' is gone
She's not the only one who knew there's somethin' wrong
Her lover's in the distance as she wipes a tear from her eye
Ruby's fading out, she disappears, it's time, time to say goodbye

Don't worry about me, I'm gonna make it alright
Got my enemies cross-haired and in my sight
I take a bad situation gonna make it right
In the shadows of darkness I stand in the light
You see it's our style to keep it true
I had a bad year, a lot I've gone through
I've been knocked out, beat down, black and blue
She's not the one coming back for you
She's not the one coming back for you

If I fall back down
You're gonna help me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend
If I fall back down
You're gonna help me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend

It takes disaster to learn a lesson
You're gonna make it through the darkest nights
Some people betray one and cause treason
We're going to make everything alright
Well, the worst of times, they don't faze me
Even if I look and act really crazy
On my way down she betrayed me
Now my vision is no longer hazy
I'm very lucky to have my crew
They stood by me when she flew
I've been knocked out, beat down, black and blue
She's not the one coming back for you
She's not the one coming back for you

If I fall back down
You're gonna help me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend
If I fall back down
You're gonna help me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend
If I fall back down
You're gonna help me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend
If I fall back down
You're gonna help me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend
(If I fall back down)
If I fall back down
You're gonna help me back up again

If I fall back down

Took the 60 bus
Out of downtown Campbell
Ben Zanotto, he was on there
He was waitin' for me
All the punk rockers
And the moon stompers
Are out on the corners where
They're sparing for change

I started thinkin'
You know I started drinkin'
You know I don't remember too much of that day
Somethin' struck me funny when we ran out of money
Where do you go now when you're only 15?

With the music execution and the talk of revolution
It bleeds in me and it goes...

Give 'em the boot the roots the radicals
Give 'em the boot you know I'm a radical
Give 'em the boot the roots the reggae on my stereo
The radio was playin' Desmond Dekker was singin'
On the 43 bus as we climb up the hill
Nothin' incoming but the reggae drummin'
And we all come from unloving homes
(I said) "Why even bother" and I pick up the bottle
Mr. bus driver please let these people on
Rude girl Carol was a mini-skirt girl
My blurry vision saw nothin' wrong

With the music execution and the talk of revolution
It bleeds in me and it goes...

Give 'em the boot the roots the radicals
Give 'em the boot you know I'm a radical
Give 'em the boot the roots the reggae on my stereo1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Reconcile to the belief
Consumed in sacred ground for me
There wasn't always a place to go
But there was always an urgent need to belong
All these bands and
All these people
All these friends and
We were equals but
What you gonna do
When everybody goes on without you?
To the end, to the end, I'll journey to the end
Started in 87 ended in 89
Got a garage or an amp we'll play anytime
It was just the 4 of us, yeah man the core of us
Too much attention unavoidably destroyed us
4 kids on tour, 3000 miles in a 4-door car not know what was goin' on
We got a million years
Tourin' out like this
Hell no, no premonition could've seen this
Matty came from far away
From New Orleans into the east bay
He said this is a mecca i said this ain't no mecca man, this place's fucked
3 months go by, he had no home he had no food he's all alone
Matty said fool me once shame on you didn't fool me twice
He went back to New OrleansEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Under the red hot moon
You take the bus downtown to the graveyard shift tonight
Under the red hot moon
You take the bus downtown to the graveyard shift tonight
Casey's from Cali-California
She's got a reputation that she didn't ask for
She's waiting for an escape now
That escape is called the one sixty four
Now, Casey, she won't admit when she is wrong
Now Casey, she wants to run, run, run
She's a punk rocker, she don't trust no one
On a south bay bus all alone
Under the red hot moon
You take the bus downtown to the graveyard shift tonight
Under the red hot moon
You take the bus downtown to the graveyard shift tonight
Casey was never caught up
Like the rest of the rats in a fucking maze
Check me out she said, I'm in a concrete jungle
I'm an individual and you are stuck in a haze
Oh hell no, she knows what the truth is
'Cause she said so, she knows who her friends are
So fuck you, don't get no closer
It'll only make her run far away
Under the red hot moon
You take the bus downtown to the graveyard shift tonight
Under the red hot moon
You take the bus downtown to the graveyard shift tonight
I know Casey's brother pretty well
You see, we spent a lot of time hanging out
I always thought for sure that she'd be the one
To get out of here and make a life for herself
But when we found her in the little league park
In the dugouts, it was cold in the dark
And no one knew why she wouldn't wake up
I think she finally made it back home
Under the red hot moon
You take the bus downtown to the graveyard shift tonight
Under the red hot moon
You take the bus downtown to the graveyard shift tonight

One time for your mind, two times for your soul
Three for the graveyards and the money I fold
Dimmed out in the city where the sun burns slow
No hope, it's a pity, I can't say no
It's not my time to go, it's not my time to die
The last thing I want is for my mother to cry
It was love at first light the very first night
Things have never been the same since I took my first flight
The way I live my life, I love, I live lavish
Lost me from the start, you lose, you'll never have it
Untouched, unleashed, back up, you don't want it
Stick him for his cash, his bag, it's how he flaunt it
Take two and pass, I'll take two and blast
Bust a motherfucker, I'm out on the smash
Pimped out, high as fuck, I'm out of control
Let's bounce, rock, skate, man I'm ready to roll
Under the red hot moon
Under the red hot moon

Maxwell can't tell he's in Hell
He just wants you to visit him there
Same old game that he's playing
His rules are never fair
Nobody want to look back
Everybody want to get high tonight before they run out of time
Where's the felon, the chargeable felon
The name of the crook who committed the crime

9-9-9 if you really want the truth
Dial 9-9-9 if you can't see it through
He ain't Jack the Ripper, he's your ordinary crook
Call it Maxwell murder for you
Maxwell got a hand in this plan
He knows who you are in this plan
Shop the rock before you bought it
Sickness Maxwell knows you caught it
Nobody want to look back
Everybody want to get high tonight before they run out of time
Where's the felon, the chargiale felon

Good morning heartache
You're like an old friend
Come and see me again
Good morning heartache
You're like an old friend
Come and see me again

Look up you're in Cleveland again
A solid line that never ends
I've got stories that you'll never believe
And I know it I wear, I wear it on my sleeve
There must've been somethin' bout you that I liked
But right here in the rain, you know it just don't seem right
I always go out, I never hide
But in Cleveland I should have stayed inside

Good morning heartache
You're like an old friend
Come and see me again
Good morning heartache
You're like an old friend
Come and see me again
Testify my love for you
And I know it runs deep through your body too
From the cold blacktop to the hot concrete
The old tan van it ain't so sweet

Good morning heartache
You're like an old friend
Come and see me again
Good morning heartache
You're like an old friend
Come and see me again

Somewhere in America in the city at night
We were far from home but you know it was gonna be alright

The unfortunate get preyed on by vultures eyes
Eighty-six cents in these pockets of mine
And you can take my money, you can take my time
But you can't take my heart, it's in the city behind

Good morning heartache
You're like an old friend
Come and see me again
Good morning heartache
You're like an old friend
Come and see me again1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hangin' out with Lars down on 6th Street
He knew that I was in trouble
I was feelin' much like the devil
There was something burnin' deep inside of me
Ran into three Puerto Ricans
These girls took us to the fun house
Where we played a lonely pinball machine

Hangin' on the corner of 52nd and Broadway
Cars passin' by but none of 'em seem to go my way
An' New York City, well I wish I was on a highway
Back to Olympia

I'm havin' a hard time understandin'
It gets all too demandin'
She's all gone and I'm stranded
Sumpin' burnin' deep inside of me
All I know it's 4'o'clock, eh
She ain't even showed up, eh
I watched a thousand people go home from work
Yeah

Hangin' on the corner of 52nd and Broadway
Cars passin' by but none of 'em seem to go my way
An' New York City, well I wish I was on a highway
Back to Olympia

How many times will it take me
Before I go crazy?
Before I lose everything?
Sumpin' burnin' deep inside of me
Ran into three Puerto Ricans
These girls took us to the fun house
I don't wanna be alone again

Hangin' on the corner of 52nd and Broadway
An cars passin' by but none of 'em seem to go my way
An' New York City, well I wish I was on a highway

Never fell in love until I fell in love with you
Never know what a good time was until I had a good time with you
If you wanna get the feeling and you wanna get it right
Then the music gotta be loud
For when the music hits I feel no pain at all

You know
Warm summer night I was drinking with my dad
He tried to give me the love that I never had
But he gave more love to his bottle of wine
So I had to go out and find love of another kind

Here it is, here I am, turn it up, fuckin' loud
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go

The Radio Clash, Magnificent 7
I was a choir boy, you showed me no heaven
Two tools surely lost
No remorse ignoring the cost
Here it is, here I am, turn it up, fuckin' loud
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio
When I got the music, oh I got a place to go
Don't 'cha know?

The common man doesn't suffer pain like this
Only the sort that has never been kissed
Let us adore our beautiful son
He's ridin' on the rivers of Babylon
Burnin' up, shootin' up bring on the brightness
See the son of god is comin' up and I see a likeness
Internalize the lunacy the misery is showin'
When you're brought up you're caught up in a system that's goin'
No one answers no one takes that call from you
Junkie man tell me what your story is...
What do, what do, what do, what do I desire
Some parent's house is on fire
Slowly the house gonna burn to the ground
The neighborhood will watch without a sound
Will someone be a witness please tell me that he's crazy
But he's not and they know that and they can't get him cause he's not crazy
Beat lock him knock him take him away his authority
Hit 'em, ship 'em, club 'em submitted conformity
No one answers no one takes that call from you
Junkie man tell me what your story is...
My hand went blind
You were in the vein clairvoyant
You were in the vein clairvoyant
My hand went blind
I make love to my transistor, my trance sister
And my transparency from the balcony
I looked out on the big field, on the big field
It opens like the cover of an old bible
And out come the wolves, out come the wolves
Their paws trampling in the snow the alphabet
I stand on my head and watch it all go away

Burnin' up, shootin' up an bring on the brightness
See the son of god is comin' up and there is a likeness
Internalize the lunacy the misery is showin' when
You're brought up and caught up in a system that is goin'EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hey little sister do you know what time it was
When you finally seen all your broken dreams
Come crashing down your door
They demand an answer and they demand it quick
Or the questions fade and the wasted days
Come crawling back for more
And I said, do you know where the power lies
And who pulls the strings?
Do you know where the power lies?
It starts and ends with you
The face of isolation
Well that's one you recognize
When you can't get straight
It's a lonely place and
It's one you do despise
Boredom is for sale now
And the helplessness you feel
Is a wounded dove and the hawks are above
Blood splattered on a reel to reel
And I said, do you know where the power lies
And who pulls the strings?
Do you know where the power lies?
It starts and ends with you
I was almost over, my world was almost gone
In a sudden rush I could almost touch
The things that I'd done wrong
My jungle's made of concrete
Through the silence I could feel
That my aim is true and I will walk on through
These mountains made of steel
And I say, do you know where the power lies
And who pulls the strings?
Do you know where the power lies?
It starts and ends with you
Oh, it starts and ends with you
It starts and ends with you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

And who would've thought what they said was true
But it was and you are lighting darkness, coming through
Silhouetted palm trees backing up against the sky
Echo park sunset, an ambulance drives by
Well, someone went down and I wonder who
Faces flash forth could it be anybody I knew
So I drank like a fish till I crawl like a rat
In the city of shit, I ended up on my back
But I can't believe you're with me after dark
So let it come together in Echo Park
And I said, who would've thought that dreams come true
And who would've thought I'd end up with you
And who would've thought what they said was true
But it was and you are lighting darkness, coming through
A red flag and nobody wins
Or a snake bite, gotta start again
So I'm fucked up from watching TV all day
I don't wanna see what Ricki Lake's gotta say
And it hits me when I'm alone, I'm an angry man
I start singing to myself, I got dealt a shitty hand
With all these feelings my heart could explode
So , no not at all

Here's a talented group of youngsters that call themselves Rancid
California sun has sunk
Behind the Anaheim Hills, here comes the night
I was high on junk
And the warm winds of Santa Ana feel alright
Will every crimmin' hood make a bargain with the world

Dodgy, cause there are no one indecision
Cause it's wild, well it's wild, wild, wild, wild
California sun has sunk

Disastrous living, disastrous living!

The pagans own the rituals and the quiet world begins to say

The vision is a new world order
The vision is a new world order
The vision is a new world order
Come along and tell your sister and your brother

The force of war, dynamite blast, rides on the weak and the poor
Don't wanna see my brother in pain
When the little man fighting all big men's wars
Don't know nothing 'bout no red, white and blue
Little men bring the big man too
Too many win, nobody lose, it all comes down to what will they choose

The vision is a new world order
The vision is a new world order
The vision is a new world order
Come along and tell your sister and your brother
The conscience of the public can not be put to sleep
The conglomerate of the nations has no bounds in which they seek
Was it the mob tellin' the CIA to put us all in this state of fear
How many of us wish we were at Jack Kennedy's ear and say

The vision is a new world order
The vision is a new world order
The vision is a new world order
Come along and tell your sister and your brother

See them try to rule the world
We don't know why
Why they want to rule the world
Cuya!
Only white men and black men's..? the white power ?
The guns of mass destruction, them fighting about
Buying the world is only so much money
Here they come to bring him down to his knees
World wide hunger ? one fear
Well gangster treaties who keep us in fear
How much more can our people bear?
Need no more division
Need no more pride and I
I will keep on fighting to keep what's mine
We the people speaking our mind
And once more, would you say it for me now?
Dynamite blast of the force of war
Government rides on the weak and poor
Don't want to see my brother in pain no more
When the little man fights all the big man's wars

? victimize
Mental slavery with the clever disguise
Our prides on our people must rise
Decide your fate but
Life won't wait
Life won't wait
Oh, life won't wait
