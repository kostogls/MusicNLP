So, you've been to school for a year or two
And you know you've seen it all
In daddy's car, thinkin' you'll go far
Back east, your type don't crawl
Play ethnicky jazz to parade your snazz
On your five-grand stereo
Braggin' that you know how the niggers feel cold
And the slums got so much soul

It's time to taste what you most fear
Right Guard will not help you here
Brace yourself, my dear
Brace yourself, my dear

It's a holiday in Cambodia
It's tough, kid, but it's life
It's a holiday in Cambodia
Don't forget to pack a wife

You're a star-belly sneech, you suck like a leech
You want everyone to act like you
Kiss ass while you bitch so you can get rich
But your boss gets richer off you
Well, you'll work harder with a gun in your back
For a bowl of rice a day
Slave for soldiers till you starve
Then your head is skewered on a stake
Now you can go where people are one
Now you can go where they get things done
What you need, my son
What you need, my son

Is a holiday in Cambodia
Where people dress in black
A holiday in Cambodia
Where you'll kiss ass or crack

Where you'll do what you're told
A holiday in Cambodia
Where the slums got so much soul

I am Governor Jerry Brown
My aura smiles and never frowns
Soon, I will be president
Carter power will soon go away
I will be Führer one day
I will command all of you
Your kids will meditate in school
Your kids will meditate in school

California über alles

Zen fascists will control you
One-hundred percent natural
You will jog for the master race
And always wear the happy face
Close your eyes, can't happen here
Big Bro on white horse is near
The hippies won't come back, you say
Mellow out, or you will pay
Mellow out, or you will pay

Now it is 1984
Knock-knock at your front door
It's the suede denim secret police
They have come for your uncool niece
Come quietly to the camp
You'd look nice as a drawstring lamp
Don't you worry, it's only a shower
For your clothes, here's a pretty flower
Die on organic poison gas
Serpent's egg's already hatched
You will croak, you little clown
When you mess with President Brown
When you mess with President Brown

'Nazi Punks Fuck Off', overproduced by Martin Hannett, take four

Punk means thinking for yourself
You ain't hardcore when you spike your hair
When a jock still lives inside your head

Nazi punks

Ten guys jump one, what a man
You fight each other, the police state wins
Stab your backs when you trash our halls
Trash a bank if you've got real balls
You still think swastikas look cool
The real Nazis run your schools
They're coaches, businessmen and cops
In a real Fourth Reich you'll be the first to go

Nazi punks

Efficiency and progress is ours once more
Now that we have the Neutron bomb
It's nice and quick and clean and gets things done
Away with excess enemy
But no less value to property
No sense in war but perfect sense at home

The sun beams down on a brand new day
No more welfare tax to pay
Unsightly slums gone up in flashing light
Jobless millions whisked away
At last we have more room to play
All systems go to kill the poor tonight
Gonna

Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor

Behold the sparkle of champagne
The crime rate's gone
Feel free again
Oh, life's a dream with you, Miss Lily White

Convinced the liberals it's okay
So let's get dressed to dance away the night

Tonight's the night that we got the truck
We're going downtown, gonna beat up drunks
Your turn to drive, I'll bring the beer
It's the late, late shift, no one to fear

And ride, ride, how we ride
And ride, low ride

It's a roundup time where the good whores meet
We're gonna drag one screaming off the street

And ride, ride, how we ride

Got a black uniform and a silver badge
We're playin' cops for real, we're playin' cops for pay

Let's ride, lowride

Pull down your dress, here's a kick in the ass
Let's beat you blue till you shit in your pants
Don't move, child, got a big black stick
There's six of us, babe, so suck on my dick!

And ride, ride, how we ride
Let's ride, low ride

The left newspapers might whine a bit
But the guys at the station, they don't give a shit
Dispatch calls, "Are you doing something wicked?"
"No siree, Jack, we're just givin' tickets!"

Let's ride, ride, how we ride
And ride, ride, how we ride
And ride, ride, how we ride

Went to a party, I danced all night
I drank 16 beers and I started up a fight
But now I am jaded, you're out of luck
I'm rolling down the stairs
Too drunk to fuck

Too drunk to fuck

Too drunk, to fuck
I'm too drunk, too drunk, too drunk

I like your stories, I love your gun
Shooting out truck tires
Sounds like loads and loads of fun
But in my room, wish you were dead
You bawl like the baby in Eraserhead

Too drunk to fuck

Too drunk, to fuck
It's all I need right now
Too drunk to fuck

I'm about to drop, my head's a mess
The only salvation is
I'll never see you again
You give me head, it makes it worse
Take out your fuckin' retainer
Put it in your purse

I'm too drunk to fuck
You're too drunk to fuck

Last call for alcohol, last call for your freedom of speech
Drink up, Happy Hour is now enforced by law
Don't forget our house special, it's called a Trickie Dickie Screwdriver, it's got one part Jack Daniels, two parts purple Kool-Aid, and a jigger of formaldehyde from the jar with Hitler's brain in it ​we've got in the back storeroom
Happy trails to you, happy trails to you!

I am Emperor Ronald Reagan
Born again with fascist cravings
Still, you made me president

Welcome to 1984!
Are you ready for the third world war?
You two will meet the secret police
They'll draft you and they'll jail your niece
You'll go quietly to boot camp!
They'll shoot you dead, make you a man
Don't you worry, it's for a cause
Feeding global corporations' claws

Die on our brand new poison gas

Making money for President Reagan
Making money for President Reagan!

You're gonna help me buy City Hall"

Tells me "All you ever do is complain," yeah

We're sorry
But you're no longer needed
Or wanted
Or even cared about here
Machines can do a better job than you
This is what you get for asking questions
The unions agree
"Sacrifices must be made"
Computers never go on strike
To save the working man you've got to put him out to pasture
Looks like we'll have to let you go
Doesn't it feel fulfilling to know
That you, the human being, are now obsolete
And there's nothing in hell we'll let you do about it?

Soup is good food (We don't need you anymore)
You made a good meal (We don't need you anymore)
Now how does it feel (We don't need you anymore)
To be shit out our ass
And thrown in the cold like a piece of trash?
We're sorry
You'll just have to leave
Unemployment runs out after just six weeks
How does it feel to be a budget cut?
You're snipped
You no longer exist
Your number's been purged from our central computer
So we can rig the facts
And sweep you under the rug
See our chart?
Unemployment's going down
If that ruins your life, that's your problem
Soup is good food
We're sorry
We hate to interrupt
But it's against the law to jump off this bridge
You'll just have to kill yourself somewhere else
A tourist might see you
And we wouldn't want that
I'm just doing my job, you know
So say uncle
And we'll take you to the mental health zoo
Force feed you mind-melting chemicals
'Til even the outside world looks great
In hi-tech science research labs
It costs too much to bury all the dead
The mutilated disease-injected
Surplus rats who can't be used anymore
So they're dumped with no minister present
In a spiraling corkscrew disposal unit
Ground into sludge and flushed away
Soup is good food
You made a good meal
We know how much you'd like to die
We joke about it on our coffee breaks
But we're paid to force you to have a nice day
In the wonderful world we made just for you
"Poor rats," we human rodents chuckle
At least we get a dignified cremation
At yet
At 6:00 tomorrow morning
It's time to get up and go to work5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hold it!
We've gotta prove we're adults now
We're not a punk rock band... We're a new wave band

I'm tired of self-respect
I can't afford a car
I wanna be a prefab superstar
I wanna be a tool
Don't need no soul
Wanna make big money
Playing rock and roll

I'll make my music boring
I'll play my music slow
I ain't no artist, I'm a business man
No ideas of my own
I won't offend
Or rock the boat
Just sex and drugs
And rock and roll
Drool, drool, drool, drool, drool, drool
My Payola!
Drool, drool, drool, drool, drool, drool
My Payola!

You'll pay ten bucks to see me
On a fifteen foot high stage
Fatass bouncers kick the shit
Out of kids who try to dance
If my friends say
I've lost my guts
I'll laugh and say
That's rock and roll
But there's just one problem

Is my cock big enough
Is my brain small enough
For you to make me a star

Give me a toot, I'll sell you my soul
Pull my strings and I'll go far
Give me a toot, I'll sell you my soul
Pull my strings and I'll go far

And when I'm rich
And meet Bob Hope
We'll shoot some golf
And shoot some dope

Is my cock big enough
Is my brain small enough
For you to make me a star

Give me a toot, I'll sell you my soul
Pull my strings and I'll go far
Guitar!

Everybody, put your hands together!

Is my cock big enough?
Is my brain small enough?
For you to make me a star
Everybody sing it one time!

Is my cock big enough?
Is my brain small enough?
For you to make me a star
Shut up and dance, everybody!

Is my cock big enough?
Is my brain small enough?
For you to make me a star

Give me a toot, I'll sell you my soul
Pull my strings and I'll go far
One more time!

Give me a toot, I'll sell you my soul
Pull my strings and I'll go far

And drool, drool, drool, drool, drool, drool
My Payola!
Drool, drool, drool, drool, drool, drool

The crowded future stings my eyes
I still find time to exercise
In uniform with two white stripes
Unlock my section of the sand
It's fenced off to the water's edge
I clamp a gas mask on my head
Oh, my beach at night
Bathe in my moonlight

Another tanker's hit the rocks
Abandoned to spill out its guts
The sand is laced with sticky glops
Oh, shimmering moonlight sheen upon
The waves and water clogged with oil
White gases steam up from the soil

Oh, my beach at night
Bathe in my moonlight

I squash dead fish between my toes
Try not to step on any bones
I turn around and I go home
I slip back through my basement door
Switch off all that I own below
Dive in my scalding wooden tub
My own beach at night
Bathe in my moonlight-ight-ight
There will always be a moon over Marin

"There, wasn't that a nice visit? Don't forget, a psychiatrist is on duty twenty-four hours a day in the blue room just up from the parking garage. Drink plenty of water when you take these. Now you can relax and return to your job!"3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Rioting, the unbeatable high
Adrenaline shoots your nerves to the sky
Everyone knows this town is gonna blow
And it's all gonna blow right now
Now you can smash all the windows that you want
All you really need are some friends and a rock
Throwing a brick never felt so damn good
Smash more glass
Scream with a laugh
And wallow with the crowds
Watch them kicking people's ass
But you get to the place
Where the real slavedrivers live
It's walled off by the riot squad
Aiming guns right at your head
So you turn right around
And play right into their hands
And set your own neighborhood
Burning to the ground instead

Riot
The unbeatable high
Riot
Shoots your nerves to the sky
Riot
Playing right into their hands
Tomorrow you're homeless
Tonight it's a blast
Get your kicks in quick
They're callin' the national guard
Now could be your only chance
To torch a police car
Climb the roof, kick the siren in
And jump and yelp for joy
Quickly, dive back in the crowd
Slip away, now don't get caught
Let's loot the spiffy hi-fi store
Grab as much as you can hold
Pray your full arms don't fall off
Here comes the owner with a gun

Riot
The unbeatable high
Riot
Shoots your nerves to the sky
Riot
Playing right into their hands
Tomorrow you're homeless
Tonight it's a blast
The barricades spring up from nowhere
Cops in helmets line the lines
Shotguns prod into your bellies
The trigger fingers want an excuse
Now
The raging mob has lost its nerve
There's more of us but who goes first
No one dares to cross the line
The cops know that they've won
It's all over but not quite
The pigs have just begun to fight
They club your heads, kick your teeth
Police can riot all that they please

Riot
The unbeatable high
Riot
Shoots your nerves to the sky
Riot
Playing right into their hands
Tomorrow you're homeless
Tonight it's a blast
Riot
The unbeatable high
Riot
Shoots your nerves to the sky

God told me to skin you alive
I kill children
I love to see them die
I kill children
And make their mamas cry
Crush 'em under my car
I wanna hear them scream
Feed 'em poison candy
To spoil their Halloween
So you're in the kids' ward
You're in there 'cause you're ill
How about some Pavulon
So I can see you chill
Time to hit the school bus
I think I'll shoot the tires
Offer them a helping hand
Of open telephone wires
Ever wanted to die?
Of course you have
But I won't till I get my revenge
Been fucked far, far too many ways
I don't wanna see people any more
Things I never ever saw before
Make me see them for the shit they are
Take as many as I can away with me
Anyone can be king for a day
So I kill children
I love to see them die
I kill children
And make their mamas cry
I kill children
I bang their heads in doors
I kill children

Down at the arsenal they keep the nerve gasses
Guarded day and night by caged white rabbits
Been sitting there for years
I'm gonna have at it
I cut through the fence, run right in and grab it

Go crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy

Now I got my own mustard gas in my pocket
Climb on a tree on a branch and drop it
On a country club full of Saturday golfers
So I can watch them die chokin', shakin' in convulsions

Go crazy, crazy!
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy!

Chemical warfare, chemical warfare!
Chemical warfare, warfare, warfare!
Chemical warfare, chemical warfare!
Chemical warfare, warfare, warfare!
Panic in the air, see the headless chickens runnin'
Golf carts head on crashin', crackin' heads wide open
Scratch the grass, mister, you can't breathe
And roll and writhe in a sandtrap starting to heave
Claw those clubs, lemme see you seethe!

Crazy!
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy!

Chemical warfare, chemical warfare!
Chemical warfare, warfare, warfare!
Chemical warfare, chemical warfare!
Chemical warfare, warfare, warfare!

Yellow air! Yellow clouds!
Blowin' down, down, down the fairway
Sensitive to the touch
Mowin' down the putting green
Heading straight for the big clubhouse
Where the stuffed country club
Effervescent ladies, so carefree
Relax, pose by the pool
Limber limp with a dry martini
Until...
Oh shit, what is going on in here?
(coughing)
Come on, move, god damnit, please!
I've got the answers, 
(shouts, screams of agony, babies crying)
Let me out!
(One, two, three, four!)

Why are you such a stupid asshole? Would you really like to know? Well, pay your fee, remove your clothes, and Yvette will show you how
You went to school where you were taught to fear and to obey, be cheerful, fit in, or someone might think you're weird. Life can be perfect. People can be trusted. Someday, I will fall in love; a nice quiet home of my very own. Free from all the pain. Happy and having fun all the time. It never happened, did it?

We got a drug
We're gonna try it out on you
Won't make you die
It'll getcha just a little bit sick

Got a head cold
Got a chest cold
And it's three days old
(Goin' on forever)
Make you hazy
Make you lazy
Drive you crazy
For days and days and days and days and days
And years

Barely got the time now
To stay on the job
Double up the dosage in your water supply
Make you even sicker 'til you're slippin' away
Getting all depressed
It's getting all your friends
You can't get it up
For nothing that'll rock the boat

The government flu
The government flu
The government flu

Slip it abroad
Keep a-slowin' down the USSR
But meanwhile
We'll keep an eye
On what it's doin' to you

Got a head cold
Got a chest cold
And it's three days old
(Goin' on forever)
Make you hazy
Make you lazy
Drive you crazy
For days and days and days and days and days
And days and days and days and days and days
And days and days and days and days and days

Punk's not dead, it just deserves to die
When it becomes another stale cartoon
A closed minded, self-centered social club
Ideas don't matter, it's who you know
If the music's gotten boring, it's because of the people
Who want everyone to sound the same
Who drive the bright people out of our so-called scene
'Til all that's left is just a meaningless fad

Hardcore formulas are dogshit
Change and caring are what's real
Is this a state of mind
Or is it just another label?
The joy and hope of an alternative
Has become its own cliche
A hairstyle's not a lifestyle
Imagine Sid Vicious at 35
Who needs a scene? Scared to love and to feel
Judging everything by loud fast rules appeal
Who played last night? I don't know, I forgot
But diving off the stage was a lot of fun!
So eager to please, peer pressure decrees
So eager to please, peer pressure decrees
Make the same old mistakes again and again
Chickenshit conformist like your parents

What's ripped us apart even more than drugs
Are the thieves and the goddamn liars
Ripping people off when they share their stuff
When someone falls are there any friends?
Harder-core-than-thou for a year or two
Then it's time to get a real job
Others stay home, it's no fun to go out
When the gigs are wrecked by gangs and thugs
When the thugs form bands, look who gets record deals
From New York metal labels looking to scam
Who sign the most racist, queer-bashing bands they can find
To make a buck revving kids up for war

Walk tall, act small
Only as tough as gang approval
Unity is bullshit
When it's under someone's fat boot
Where's the common cause?
Too many factions safely sulk in their shells
"Agree with us on everything or we won't help with anything"
That kind of attitude just makes a split grow wider
Guess who's laughing while the world explodes?
When we're all crybabies who fight best among ourselves

So eager to please, peer pressure decrees
So eager to please, peer pressure decrees
Make the same old mistakes again and again
Chickenshit conformist like your parents

That farty old rock and roll attitude's back
It's competition, man, we wanna break big
Who needs friends when the money's good?
That's right, the '70s are back
Cock-rock metal's like a bad laxative
It just don't move me, you know?
The music's okay when there's more ideas than solos
Do we really need the attitude too?

Shedding thin skin too quickly
As a fan it disappoints me
Same old stupid sexist lyrics
Or is Satan all you can think of?
Crossover is just another word for lack of ideas
Maybe what we need are more trolls under the bridge
Will the metalheads finally learn something?
Will the punks throw away their education?
No one's ever the best once they believe their own press
Maturing don't mean rehashing mistakes of the past

So eager to please, peer pressure decrees
So eager to please, peer pressure decrees
Make the same old mistakes again and again
Chickenshit conformist like your parents

The more things change, the more they stay the same
We can't grow if we won't criticize ourselves
The '60s weren't all failure, it's the '70s that stunk
As the clock ticks, we dig the same hole
Music scenes ain't real life, they won't get rid of the bomb
Won't eliminate rape or bring down the banks
Any kind of real change takes more time and work
Than changing channels on a TV set
So why are we

So eager to please, peer pressure decrees
So eager to please, peer pressure decrees
Make the same old mistakes again and again

Are you believing the morning papers?
War is coming back in style
There's generals here, advisors there, and Russians nibbling everywhere
The chessboard's filling up with red, we make more profits when we blow off their heads

Economy is looking bad, let's start another war (When ya get drafted!)
Fan the fires of racist hatred, we want total war (When ya get drafted!)

Drooling fingers, panic buttons
Playing with missiles like they're toys
There's easy money, easy jobs especially when you build the bombs that blow big cities off the map
Just guess who profits when we build 'em back up?

Yeah, what Big Business wants Big Business gets, it wants a war (When ya get drafted!)
Trilateral Commission goonies laugh and scheme for more (When ya get drafted!)
Call the Army, call the Navy, stocked with kids from slums (When ya get drafted!)
If you can't afford a slick attorney, we might make you a spy!

Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher
There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
And they're all waiting, the devil may care
And I'm just the devil with love to spare
So Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas

How I wish that there were more
Than the twenty-four hours in the day
Even if I ran out of speed, boy
I wouldn't sleep a minute away
Oh, there's black jack and poker and the roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost on every deal
All you need's sonar and nerves of steel
Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas

Viva Las Vegas where the neon signs are flashing
And your one arm bandits crashing
All those hopes down the drain
Viva Las Vegas turning day into night
Turning night into day
If you see it once
You'll never be the same again
I'm going to keep on the run
I'm going to have me some fun
If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke up well
I'll always remember that I had a swinging time
I'm going to give it everything I've got
Lady luck's with me, the dice stay hot
Got coke up my nose to dry away the snot
Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas
Viva, Viva Las VegasEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I don't need your way of life
I can't stand your attitudes
I can do without your strife
I don't need this fucking world, I don't need this fucking world!

This world brings me down
Gag with every breath
This world brings me down
I'm looking forward to death

It seems so unreal to me
So much hate and so much pity
I can't take another day
It's such a bore, it gets me really sore
I don't need this fucking world, I don't need this fucking world

This world brings me down
Gag with every breath
This world brings me down
I'm looking forward to deaaath!

Looking forward to death
Looking forward to deaaaaaath!3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
