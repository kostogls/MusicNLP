While I'm Living
Thanks I'll Be Giving
To the Most High You know

I am living while I am living to the father I will pray
Only him knows how we get through everyday
With all the hike in the price
Arm and leg we have to pay
While our leaders play

All I see people a rip and a rob and a rival
Thief never love fe see thief wid long bag
No love for the people who a sufferin bad
Another toll to the poll may God help we soul
What is to stop the youths from get out of control
Full up of education yet no own no payrollyroll
The clothes on my back have countless eyehole.
I could go on and on the full has never been told


Who can afford to run will run
But what about those who can't... they will have to stay
Opportunity a scarce, scarce commodity
In these times I say... When mama spend her last and send you go class
Never you ever play
It's a competitive world for low budget people
Spending a dime while earning a nickel
With no regards to who it may tickle
My cup is full to the brim
I could go on and on the full has never been told

All I see people a rip and a rob and a rival
Tief never love fe see tief wid long bag
No love for the people who a sufferin bad
Another toll to the poll may God help we soul
What is to stop the youths from get out of control
Full up of education yet no on no payroll
The clothes on my back have countless eyehole
Could go on and on and the fool has never been thrown
(On and On)
Though this life keep getting me down
Don't give up now
Got to survive somehow
Could go on and on and the full has never been told


Who can afford to run will run
But what about those who can't... they will have to stay
Opportunity a scarce, scarce commodity
In these times I say... When mama spend her last and send you go class
Never you ever play
It's a competitive world for low budget people
Spending a dime while earning a nickel
With no regards to who it may tickle
My cup is full to the brim
I could go on and on the full has never been told
I could go on and on the full has never been told
I could go on and on the full has never been told
I could go on and on the full has never been told
I could go on and on the full has never been told
I could go on and on the full has never been told
I could go on and on...
The full has never...
Been...

What a world of love!
Now where could it be?
Must bee somewhere for me
I Buju Banton need it desperately
Baba bomb

Wanna be loved
Not for who you think I am
Nor what you want me to be
Could you love me for me?
Real love, with no strings attached
I wanna give you me heart
Don't want to take it back
And this is my chat (cho!)

Been searching for a long long time
For that oh-so-true love
To comfort this heart of mine
No pretense stop wasting my time
A virtuous woman is really hard to find
I'm telling you lady
I'm only human, not looking for impossibility
Just a genuine woman with sincerity
Someone who is always near to hold me
Show me you care, up front and boldly
Don't shun my feelings, all the positive meanings
Love me morning, noon all seasons
Wanna be loved
Not for who you think I am
Nor what you want me to be
Could you love me for me?
Real love, with no strings attached
I wanna give you me heart
Don't want to take it back
This is my chat (cho)

Well every ho have it's stick in a bush
What happen to me...she must be somewhere out there
Now where could she be?
Caught up passionately in a love rhapsody
I'm like waiting on some honey
But there ain't no queen bee
Everybody's laughing
Some say I'm silly
No infatuation, no love fantasy
Woman you lead my life on a string
I can't tell the on and off thing
I'm oh so lonely inside so I sing

Wanna be loved
Not for who you think I am
Nor what you want me to be
Could you love me for me?
Real love, with no strings attached
I wanna give you me heart
Don't want to take it back
This is my chat (cho)
I would spend my nights at home
But if it means contention
I'd rather be alone
Tell the service man cut the phones
Lock all communication
If there's no light within my day
I'd rather stay in isolation
For that special someone a lifetime I'll wait
I know that I'll be okay
Cross my heart, every day I live I pray
And I know she'll come my way
Night and day for this woman I pray

Wanna be loved
Not for who you think I am
Nor what you want me to be
Could you love me for me?
Real love, with no strings attached
I wanna give you me heart
Don't want to take it back
This is my chat (cho)4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I see them lie and lay in wait
Standing at the gate
But yay I hold up my head and I sing
Hear what I sing nah...

Murderer! Blood is on your shoulder
Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow
Murder! Your insides must be hollow
How does it feel to take the life of another?
Murderer! Blood is on your shoulder
Kill me today you cannot kill I tomorrow
Murder! Your insides must be hollow
How does it feel to take a life?

You can hide from man but not your conscience
Unnu nyam the bread of sorrow, drink the wine of violence
Allowed yourself to be conquered by the serpent
Why you disobey the first commandment?
Walk through the valley I fear no pestilence
God is my witness and him ah meh evidence
Lift up mine eyes from whence cometh help
You will never escape this judgement
Murderer! Blood is on your shoulder
Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow
Murder! Your insides must be hollow
How does it feel to take a life?

I tell you, all men are created equal
But behind the trigger its a different sequel
Some ah murder people just to collect medals
Stop commit dirty acts for the high officials
You could wash your head until you can't wash no more
It is like an epidemic and you won't find a cure
Upper class you could be rich, middle class whether you poor
Only the righteous won't feel insecure
You ever think about your skull getting bored? (buck buck!)

Murderer! Blood is on your shoulder
Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow
Murder! Your insides must be hollow
How does it feel to take a life?

Drinking sulphur bitters won't bitter like your end
Only God can help you, no family no friend
Don't let the curse be upon your children's children
Abednigo, Shadreck, Meshek, Daniel in the den
Jonah in the whale's belly, but him never condemned
Job with the leprosy, and he still reached heaven
He will do for you everything He has done for them
Murderer! Blood is on your shoulder
Kill I today you cannot kill I tomorrow
Murder! Your insides must be hollow
How does it feel to take a life?

You can hide from man but not your conscience
Unnu nyam the bread of sorrow, drink the wine of violence
Allowed yourself to be conquered by the serpent
Why you disobey the first commandment?
Walk through the valley I fear no pestilence
God is my witness and him ah meh evidence
Lift up mine eyes from whence cometh help
You will never escape this judgement

'Til I'm laid to rest, yes
Always be depressed
There's no life in the West
I know the East is the best
All the propaganda they spread
Tongues will have to confess
I'm in bondage, living is a mess
I've got to rise up, alleviate the stress
No longer will I expose my weakness
He who seeks knowledge begins with humbleness
Work 7 to 7 but I'm still penniless
All the food upon my table, Massa God bless
Holler for the needy and shelterless
Ethiopia awaits all prince and princess
'Til I'm laid to rest, yes
Always be depressed
There's no life in the West
I know the East is the best, yes
Propaganda they spread
Tongues will have to confess
What coube so bad about the East, everybody wants a piece
Africa for Africans, Marcus Mosiah speak
Unification outnumbers defeat
What a day when we walk down Redemption Street
Banner on heads, Bible inna we hands
One and all let's trod the promised land
Buju go down a Congo stopped in Shashamane Land
The city of Harare where Selassie come from
In Addis Ababa then Botswana
Left Kenya end up in Ghana
Oh, what a beauty my eyesight behold
Only Ethiopia protect me from the cold
'Til I'm laid to rest, yes
Always be depressed
There's no life in the West
I know the East is the best
All the propaganda they spread
Tongues will have to confess
Organize and centralize come as one
Our seeds shall be so many more than sand
Some new and replenish, pure and clean, and
For too long we've been under this band
Some a save a bag a riches, yet they die empty hand
Go on saying I'm stupid and laugh all you can
Easier for a camel to enter through a needle eye
Than a rich man to enter a Zion
Take it from I man
So
'Til I'm laid to rest, yes
Always be depressed
There's no life in the West
I know the East is the best
All the propaganda they spread
Tongues will have to confess
I'm in bondage, living is a mess
I've got to rise up, alleviate the stress
No longer will I expose my weakness
He who seeks knowledge begins with humbleness
Work 7 to 7 but I'm still penniless
All the food upon my table, Massa God bless
Holler for the needy and shelterless

Banner on heads, Bible inna we hands
One and all let's trod the promised land
Buju go down a Congo stopped in Shashamane Land
The city of Harare where Selassie come from
In Addis Ababa then Batswana
Left Kenya end up in Ghana
Oh, what a beauty my eyesight behold
Only Ethiopia protect me from the cold
'Til I'm laid to rest, yes
Always be depressed
There's no life in the West

Only Rasta can liberate the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute that they are with you
Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute, they don't like you

Why try to make I unhappy
Really I don't know
If it was up to them my friend
We would never see the sun nor the snow
Through that mystical communication within
We keep on coming together
I love to see brothers and sisters
Looking out for one another
That's the way it should be
Not contrary, stop tearing down each other

Only Rasta can liberate the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe one minute that they are with you
Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute, that they are with you
Hard drugs won't do
You're just behaving like they want you to
Arrogance is much different from ignorance
And I know you feel the same way too
Many live this life without having a clue
No reason why they are so sad and blue
Places to go so much things to do
Not a moment to reflect on the cycle of life


It hard, it hard, it hard (yeah)
Mek them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard (let them know)
Let them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard (let them know)
Let them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard (oh god)
We waan go home

No matter what the world may say out ah street
Must affi survive, won't accept defeat
Now I'm weary, tired and dreary
Got no time to waste
You better know that
It's not an easy road
And many see the glamour and the glitter so them think a bed of rose, mi say
Who feels it knows, oooh
Lord help me sustain these blows
I cry!
It's not an easy road
And many see the glamour and the glitter so them think a bed of rose, mi say
Who feels it knows, oooh
Lord help me sustain these blows

While you rise to see the sun
Who you love a pull you down
Trying to discredit the works you have done
Some can't satisfy with the past of ally
From the Scribes and Pharisees
You've got to stay wide
Hold up me head glancing on both side
A wait, anticipate, pray fi you to slide
Righteousness prevail with Jah by my side
Deliver Jonah from the whale
No leave him to die
Help us all Abbabajoni
Hold up my head and cry
I tell you now
It's not an easy road, Oh no
It's not an easy road

I've been travelling morning
With such a heavy load
Now it's noon and I cannot afford
To put down that burden 'longside the road
Yea, I've got to hold it
I got to humble myself like a child
Upon my face I've the got to put on a smile
Make up my mind just to walk more miles
Oh God I've got to, I've got to, because I know that

It's not an easy road
And many see the glamour and the glitter so them think a bed of rose, mi say
Who feels it knows, oooh
Lord help me sustain these blows
Hot foot
It's not an easy road
And many see the glamour and the glitter so them think a bed of rose, mi say
Who feels it knows, oooh
Lord help me sustain these blows
From the minute of birth, you enter this earth
Obstacles deh inna your way to overcome first
Throughout everyday they seem to get worse
Oh my God, cast away this curse!
Everybody ah try fi make every end meet
Through every way they endeavor
Lord God you see it3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

One more day in the struggle
Haffi get up and go juggle, you done know
Water and a little sugar inna we pan
Me nah seek fi trouble no man
Oh oh

Said, I had close one yesterday
Jah put an angel over me
Be strong
Hold a firm meditation
One day things must get better
Don't you go down, keep your head above the water
Say, one day things must get better
Be strong
And I say, hold a firm meditation
One day things must get better
Don't you go down, keep your head above the water
Chant, one day things must get better

The rich is wise in his own conceit
But the fool with overstanding searcheth him out
Poor man mourn, the rich riches increase
I said, be not grieved, riches are not forever
Envy not the oppressor, choose none of his ways
Be not wise in thine own eyes, only Jah you must praise
Strive not with a man without cause
If he have done you no harm, let bygones be bygones
Said, I had close one yesterday
Jah put an angel over me
Be strong
And I say, hold a firm meditation
One day things must get better
Don't you go down, keep your head above that water
One day things must get better
Be strong
And I say, hold a firm meditation
One day things must get better
Don't you go down, keep your head above the water
Say, one day things must get better

This 9 to 5 is a joke compared to the pressure
The minister says the economy is getting better
Misleading the people, the mass still suffers
Oh Jah, scarce benefits and spoils
Oh
Jah knows that we feel it, woah, woah, woah, woah
Day and night we cry, cry, cry
Jah knows that we feel it, woo, woo, woo
Who can help a weeping soul like I?

Said, I had close one yesterday
Jah put an angel over me
Be strong
And I say, hold a firm meditation
One day things must get better
Don't you go down, keep your head above that water
One day things must get better
Be strong
And I bawl, hold a firm meditation
One day things must get better
Don't you go down, keep your head above the water
Say, one day things must get better
The rich is wise in his own conceit
But the poor with overstanding searcheth him out
Poor man mourn, the rich riches increase
I said, be not grieved, riches are not forever
Envy not the oppressor, choose none of his ways
Be not wise in thine own eyes, only Jah you must praise
Strive not with a one without cause
If they have done thee no harm, let bygones be bygones

Said, I had close one yesterday
Jah put an angel over me
Said, I had close one yesterday
Jah Jah put an angel -
And I say, be strong, oh oh
Hold a firm meditation
One day things must get better
Don't you go down, keep your head above the water
Chant, one day things must get better
Be strong
And I bawl, hold a firm meditation
One day things must get better
Don't go down, keep your head above the water
One day things must get better...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

To the end like "Chucky"

Guardian angel, fairy godmother
A friend to the end and also a lover

There must be a reason
I was given one more chance
My heart's still beating
Now all this time I've been blind
Only running against the wind
Friends of mine past with time
After living a life of sin
Some many give up, many give in
It's my determination to win
I survive the worst of times
I survive, yeah

I was buried alive
But I'm still breathing
I don't know what tomorrow may bring
But I've got a feeling
Oh I
Now, I am alive
There must be a reason
I was given one more chance
My heart's still beating
Oh

They make a ditch for one
But there would be two
In their attempt to hold my life
The wicked things they do
But Jah make I brave
And I conquer the grave, woah Lord
The Lord is my salvation
Of whom shall I fail
I was buried alive
But I'm still breathing
I don't know what tomorrow may bring
But I've got a feeling
Oh I
Now, I am alive
There must be a reason
I was given one more chance
My heart's still beating
One more time!
I said, buried alive
But I'm still breathing
I don't know what tomorrow may bring
But I've got a feeling
Oh right
