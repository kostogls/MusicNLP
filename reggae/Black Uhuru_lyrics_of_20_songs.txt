I've got a stalk of sinsemilla
Growing in my back yard
I've got a stalk of sinsemilla
Growing in my back yard
Don't cut down the cali tree
Cause it makes the best tea for me
And the doctor says it gives naturally
One thing this doctor will need
A lot of food
To survive and go to in Babylon

I've got a stalk of sinsemilla
Growing in my back yard
I've got a stalk of sinsemilla
Growing in my back yard
Yes I've walked the streets and seen children down town
Begging everyone they see and it hurt me
It can’t be right what this world do for the youth
And (for)the little herb i´m selling they want to capture me
I and I don't cherish wickedness
Because it's none profit to I and I
I've got a stalk of sinsemilla
Growing in my back yard
I've got a stalk of sinsemilla
Growing in my back yard
Anything that is none profit
I and I don't take for it
Pass it, pass it
All over I and I

I've got a stalk of sinsemilla
Growing in my back yard
I've got a stalk of sinsemilla
Growing in my back yard
There is a red house over yonder
Full of marijuana
I've been sitting on the corner
Chatting up with the farmer

I've got a stalk of sinsemilla
Growing in my back yard
I've got a stalk of sinsemilla
Growing in my back yard
Free the herb
Heal the nation
Heal the sick

I've got a stalk of sinsemilla
Growing in my back yard
I've got a stalk of sinsemilla
Growing in my back yard1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Then i almost lost my nerves
My fingers start shaking as the
Day start breaking
I could a never keep it no longer
I had to tell it to one another
You bum right here…

Some say i am nuts zooky crazy
Want i to leave the music alone
They say go and look work
I and i are lazy
But i think for a while and
Say to my self
It's a time for every style

I may not be a movie star
I don't drive no fancy car
I can afford only a Winchester cigar
From the day i was born and
Given life
I and i a actor genius name it

Abortion, abortion
You got to have caution
Abortion, abortion
You got to have caution

I remember that night we were together
Sharing Jah love with one another
Those nights I can't forget
Lord knows I did sweat

Abortion, abortion
You got to have caution
You got to have caution

Due a minor strain of contraceptive
Blood vessel bursts in their brain
Oh what a shame! Oh what a strain!
To see my black sisters going down the drain
Abortion, abortion
You got to have caution
Abortion, abortion
You got to have caution

A woman was made from the rib of a man
To multiply and not to divide
So leave your pills and thrills
And your world of sodomy
Show unto yourself woman no sympathy

Abortion, abortion
You got to have caution
You got to have caution
Abortion, abortion
You got to have caution

I say throw away the boots
And I want my little youth
Throw away the pills
And I need my little girl
Woman! Don't you got feelings?
Woman! Don't you got feelings?
Woman! You got feelings!
You're bright like a star!

Darkness; seems to cover the world
Darkness; seems to cover the world

What does it worth to put yourself in a wrong-town
Who told you to go? Obligation
Get off my back; Babylon
There's a pride in each an' everyone's stage of life
I must keep Jah work and trim this foundation
Most of all, they go to bed and dem high in their head

Darkness; seems to cover the world
Darkness; seems to cover the world

I see you mothers, and fathers
Wandering all over through material things
Is this a result of their sin?
Every little look over my shoulder, someone die

Darkness; seems to cover the world
Darkness; seems to cover the world
Yes, my structure isn't random
I am among the rioters, eaters of flesh
There is no return to your faulty destruction
My blood is hot, you telling I

Darkness; seems to cover the world
Darkness; seems to cover the world

With the good foot I climb the ladder of life
Darker than blood, in a dis ya attention
Trumpet and voice are not for only celebration
Let us struggle with the new generation
The Deaf, The Dumb, The Blind

The youths of Eglinton
Won't put down their Remington
The youth of Brixton
They have their 45 Smith and
Wesson pistol pistol
The youth of Utica Avenue
They just can't keep cool
So much gun shot some
Cripple some turn fool
They are responsible for a lot
Of children
And they need food
And they want to go to school
I say the youth of Eglington
Won't put down their Remington
I say the youth of Kingston
Won't leave their Magnum
Pistol pistol
A very thin line to start the crime
Who will be the first to
Volunteer
You love you love your fuckery
Get up and get yourself together
You hear the words of Jah Jah
Coming from the hill top of
Dabra Dabra
Keep you strength
The youth of Eglington
Won't put down their Remington
I say the youth of Brixton
They put down their 45 Smith
And Wesson pistol pistol
Stop and listen
They want you to fight the good fight
But save you strength
For strength of life
The youths in Africa
All a dem a thriller
I say the youth of Eglington
Won't put down their Remington
The youth of Kingston
Won't leave their Magnum
Pistol pistol
Poor Jill she was a spill
She got hit by a stray shot
The youths of Eglington
Won't put down their Remington
The youths of Brixton
They put down their 45 Smith

Aussi peu nombreux que des grains de sables

Pendant que tant d'autres ne reçoivent pas leurs du
Ils privent un humain des ses droits

Utterance of a rasta (repeat)
Long long ago

Rastafari going around
Taking little children away
But now time is at hand

Saying was wrong
And that rasta let them
Know their homeland
And seek their culture
What a joy to hear the
Utterance from a rasta (repeat)
I and i was granted
To drink from the fountain of life
I god will make i hold tight
I and i knee will not
Wobble i and i
A v.i.p international
And now they putting
Rasta on the air
Before that they used
Live in fear
What a joy to hear the
Utterance of a rasta (repeat)
There is a way that
Seemeth right to man
And yet in jah jah sight it wrong
