You know that life and love is a heavy, heavy load

Hey, Mr. collie man, why don't you come 'round, no more?

If I think she beautiful, well that's for sure
Give a little loving, but I still gonna need some more, rob it
Stealing from the rich and then give it to the poor
Telling everybody it don't matter anymore, she said
All I really needed was a friend like you
Help me through and together we can change, but
If I was to stay, it wasn't for too long
People sing the same song, everywhere I'm going
Closer to the sun and far from the moon
People screaming out they gonna see me real soon
They say oooohhh, ooohhhhh, ooohhhh,ooooohhh

The taste of this joint
We rollin' it up in Philly
And I gettin' the weed from Cali
Original, cutting the beat
And I getting all the weed
I said, taste of this joint
We rollin' it up in Philly
And I gettin' the weed from Cali

Let's take a plane up out to Philly
We flying outta Dallas
Somewhere ???
Used to land on an empty chalice
Every land, we gon' play
An' I getting the weed from Cali
And rolling it up in Philly
Smoking weed up all day
We never seem to complain, really
And I really need to hear it
It a Kryptonite and don't you know
And we would not get near
No ordinary sensimilla
And the only thing they wanted
When the kryptonite is gone
We started smoking supersonic
If you got money to pay
Better put your money on it
A caption that go on and on and on and on
And a sight you never believe
What I'm smoking is 'semillia
No explanation needed
When I'm high, I don't conceal it
Everything is okay
This joint
We rollin' it up in Philly
And I gettin' the weed from Cali
Original, cutting the beat
And I getting all the weed
I said, taste of this joint
We rollin' it up in Philly
And I gettin' the weed from Cali

Smoked up all my weed from Philly
And everything from Cali
I'm all up in them palm trees
Smoking a pound of Maui-Wowie
Pakalolo, grade A
We go to the Caribbean
Deliver it up by the sea
Ya know connections get paid
Different strap for every season
If you really need a reason
We'd like the Kryptonite and an open red bull, lightin' b's
More than ounce or two of chronic
In the end it's what we needed
No one official type, pretender cut
Oh no, man, we'd say, "come and let the music play"
Full volume, and repeat it
Perfection that go on and on and on and on
From here or Minnesota
From there onto Daytona
We came up in New York
Now up in Cali, so pro-bono
Everything is okay
 (x3)
This joint
We rollin' it up in Philly
And I gettin' the weed from Cali

Girl, we don't need no cocaine
We don't need no ecstasy
To ruin our brains
Only one thing sets us free
Or ease our pain
Talkin' 'bout the herb
Girl, with someone just like you
Everything we do's a sin
Or is that true?
Girl, I love you Mary Jane

Fall, without the herb
So, put your love into this

I tried two weeks without you
I missed your smell in the air
I saw your face in a day dream
But lost you in a nightmare
Your so dangerous
She only wants me when there's two of us
And I ain't sharing her with no one else
I could hate you but don't want to

Money in my pocket but it can't buy me love
Eyes so gray like she come from above
Mona June, without you, I would've never seen the world like I do
Money in my pocket but it can't buy me love
Eyes so gray like she come from above
Mona June, without you, I would've never seen the world like I do

I was a little bit lost before
Before I looked into your eyes
You see in life there's different stories all different ways for you to hide
She keeps a smile upon my face
Knowing your love is always there
She only wants me when there's two of us
And I ain't old enough to share
Money in my pocket but it can't buy me love
Eyes so gray like she come from above
Mona June, without you, I would've never seen the world like I do
Money in my pocket but it can't buy me love
Eyes so gray like she come from above
Mona June, without you, I would've never seen the world like I do

I can't go on without you
Always in my life
I never knew what I'd do
If you weren't always right
In front of me, in times of trouble
Where every day is like another
Little remedy
Well imma keeping you close so I can sleep at night

Money in my pocket but it can't buy me love
Eyes so gray like she come from above
Mona June, without you, I would've never seen the world like I do

Mona June
Needs me too
Without me she wouldn't know what to do
Mona June
Sing the tune
Without her I wouldn't know what to doEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Put up your hands girl, but not so pushy
If you wanna be comin' and makin' sweet love to me
And if you're the type of girl that do anything to please
Maybe, then, I realize you ain't got what I need
To keep my soul alright
It keeps me up high above
Yes me got the reason to come question your love
It keeps my soul alright
It keeps me up high above
Want me girly to come give me some sweet lovin'
And in the morning time, she makes me feel alright
Then me gotta be waitin' till the day turns to night
'Cause in the evening time, she makes me feel alright
Girl you got me wishin' this would happen every night

Said, if you want to get with me
Girl, this is what you'll find
But a man who's got the type of moves to make you lose your mind
You tell me that your love is true on each and every day
You tell me that you've got that type of lovin' here to stay
Sweet honey

You see me laughin' cause it's kinda funny to me
The way she say she never give her lovin' for free
She say she got a man, why she lookin' at me?
Yes, she want a lover with the sensitivity, ya
But won't you tell me that your love's from the heart?
Yes, the type of lovin' that can tear mine apart
Girl, you got to realize before it ever starts
Yes, I am the man who won't come breakin' your heart

She gonna steal my money
Sweet honey
She gonna steal my lovin'
Yes you try to tell me that you're sent from above
Girl you give me reason to come question your love
Sweet honey
She gonna steal my money
Sweet honey
She gonna steal my lovin'

Hello, little darling
Ain't no need to worry
Feels right, in my arms, now
Why go home, be all alone?
But, if the sun shines, know that's because of you
Just know that's true
 (Kyle)
When all your money's gone
Where will you be?
If your love is strong
That's all you need
 (G-Love)
One time, you know i love you
With your funky ass style
I love you twice a month since you had our first child
Our love runs deep like the blood in my veins
I love you always, and always the same
Love remains
Love your every change
Love your every phase
The passing of the day, plus when your away
Oh darling, darling, if you stay, my love will never change
Feel the power when our two hearts will combine
The power is yours and the power is mine
When lovers part, you know the sky must cry
Write you love letters till my pen runs dry
If you stay, good lovin' make me wanna fly
If you go; rise and fall, dip and dive
You who I'm with, so I shine so bright
I love you darling till the day that I die
 (Kyle)
Darling, darling, said, now where'd you go?
I said I'll never know, the way you come and go

When all your money's gone
Where will you be?
If your love is strong
That's all you need
 (Kyle)
Call a 911 and its emergency
But even in the 912, do you feel the urgency?
To people all around the world who never heard of me
Just leave another message please
Lord please guide and protect me
I got the love in my heart
I got fire in my soul
This no type of fire that nobody can control
But when I'm up on the mic
I got the mind overload
They never test me just because they don't rock and roll
I'm singing oh my God, Lord have mercy
Thought fools were gettin' bad
But now they're even gettin' worse, see
Some things can't be healed up by no doctors or no nurses
It's time to stop the fussin' and the fightin' and the cursin'
This world is hopeless, but I love it, anyway
That's why they givin' all the good love away/for free
And if u need love, with your lovin' are you brave?
Come on and give a little good love to me
That's what they want
 (Kyle)
Darling, darling, said, now where'd you go?
I said I'll never know, the way you come and go

When all your money's gone
Where will you be?
If your love is strong
That's all you need
 (Kyle)
It's a long, long way from home, but hold on
It's a long, it's a long, long way, but hold on
It's a long, it's a long, long way, but hold on
It's a long, it's a long, long way, but hold on
(fading out)
Call a 911 and it's emergency

If you want it
Lord, you can have it now
In any way you want to go
And if you need it
Reach right out and grab it love
Some actin' like they never know

Respect is given where respect is due
Your mother lived up with a lot and watched to carry you through
Respect for them becomes respect for you
Mark my words and everybody know it's true
Harder you come will be then harder you fall
Said you wanna back, they're singin' come on come on
Some others knowin' when them back against the wall
While we never see them fightin' for the truth

And if you want it
Then you can have it love
It's any way you want to go
And if you need it
Reach right out and grab it, love
Some actin' like they never know
But if you want it
Then you can have it love
It's any way you want to go
Some them coming said they pick up them chest
Sayin' that they're the best that they're better than the rest
My lovers know there will be no contest
While others going like they are the one man show
Some never listenin' and some never learn
They do battle in the fire and they bound to get burned
They think they know that love is something that's earned
They've gone astray and then they never to return

Well if you want it
Lord you can have it now
It's any way you want to know
And if you need it
Reach right out and grab it, love
Some actin' like they never know

Things that we say for some people sounds outrageous
Hard as them live it and take it as contagious
Some other laugh and think you're just hilarious
Some other feel it and praise you like a savior
The harder they come so the harder they fall
The weaker their mind the eyes to wall
Respect must be given to one and to all
My message spread over love
Some they comin' only with humbleness
Never can be no stress how they living is righteous
The man with love is the one that ya bless
Everything else in them life it will follow
Some they comin' only strictly with love
Like the Lord up above see it's unconditional it
Is the way we should all be thinkin' of
That's the way and that would be one mission road

Well, if you want it
Lord, you can have it now
It's any way you want to go
And if you need it
Reach right out and grab it now
Some actin' like they never know
Lord, if you want it
Then you can have it love
It's any way you want to go
And if you need it
Reach right out and grab it now

This version is way from creation
Creation
This version

There ain't no other like a sister or a brother taking care of one another
Me for you and you for me
Birds of one feather we can always stick together
You and me no matter what the weather
That's the way it's supposed to be
Open the bible to keep our souls alive
Saying love to all mankind
Living strong and living free
Smoking on trees and living life on wislee
In a ghetto by the sea that is  the place where we want to be
Times you know we need to be strong
Lord we need you to took a reload

Making things when mamaâ€™s needs wrong
Help us through  to message this load
Taking me from dust untill dawn
Lord is you we depend upon
Oh we still the glory of dawn
Even when we singing this song
They don't know how to love
And the blessings from above
Keep aside your grudge and see what to see
Waking up and living is what you have been giiven is gift
Just go to prison anytime of the day
We taking love for the life at the moment
We taking love write your name above when you hear us any way
Just have to play this fortune make my a day
It's not that strange for music to pull you out of soul
Lord we need you to took a reload

Like walkin' on the moon was such a good feelin'
I'm lyin' in bed and I'm starin' at the ceilin'
Can't wake up on Monday morning
Thinkin' about work makes me yawn
And as I look outside it's rainin', pourin'
Cats and dogs, don't wanna think no more
And when I gotta get up and get out my bed
I'd rather sleep in late and smoke a b-load instead

Because the harder you try, the less you succeed
Don't try at all and get everything you need
Because the harder you fall, the more it's gon' bleed
Watch where you steppin', 'cause you best not step on me

If you're ugly on the outside, it don't matter
If the beauty on the inside, it over powers
If the beauty on the outside, it won't matter
If you're ugly on the inside, then I don't want
And if you the type of person gettin no recognition
Reach inside your pocket, feelin' all your money missin'
And you wanna shoot your guns, but you got no ammunition
Open up your mind, body, soul, and take a listen
Because the harder you try, the less you succeed
Don't try at all and get everything you need
Because the harder you fall, the more it's gon' bleed
Watch where you steppin', 'cause you best not step on me

It's always hard when you're workin' for the other man
Tryin' to make a dollar with the palms of my empty hands
It seems so easily, but it never seems to last long

All the way to Cali, Cali, that's where I wanna be

I said, you want some?
Even though you never need it
Do you feel it, yeah?
I said, you want some?
Even though you never need it

Girl, you is so fine
Hold you near to me, all the time
Things i'll do for you, would do you for me?
Hold me too
Gold is in your eyes
Need you near to me, all the time
Lord, i understand
Things you'll do for me, do to me


Girl (girl go)
Go slow (nicely for a night just to live- and move on)
Boy (let go)
Go slow (nicely for a night just to live- and move on)
That's been for you, whoa
You're not trying
Coming in hope you be the problem like the lying
You be better than them, so you never biting
Fronting all the shit and then the one they are reciting
Cos you better than them
You're not trying
Coming in you hope you all be burning like the lion
You be tougher than them so, you never biting
Fighting all the shit and then the people are reciting
Cos you better than them

So, when I was just a little young child
Playing every game on the streets
Ghetto, someone says, "Who are fatherless?"
There was a mother, are you bet that you could keys
Speaking out the mind, and then a friend that who will leach
Bless em s-low, body write a double feat
Spirits come out and just to understand the beats
In this wonderland world
I remember the days up in the past
Time didn't matter
I remember the days up in the past
Time didn't matter

I didn't mean to be so late
It's just that I got talking
Had a drink, smoked a couple of Js
Missed a bus and wound up walking
Go to call and let you know
It was busy, and I couldn't get through
I didn't mean to let you down
I know how much it hurts you

Well, I would do for you
All you'd have me do
And all you have to do
Is ask me to
And all you have to say
Is "steal me away"
And I'll come running back again
And I'll come running back again

I don't know what came over me
It must have slipped my mind
I try to make it up to you
Let's leave the past behind
I promise that I'll do my best
Change my wicked ways
Don't believe the things you hear
Or listen to things they say
'Cause I would do for you
All you'd have me do
And all you'd have to do
Is ask me to
And all you have to say
Is "steal me away"
And I'll come running back again
And I'll come running back again

If something's wrong, then let me know
Ya swallow things inside
Your pretty eyes can melt my heart
But your sadness, you can't hide
Try to give me one more chance
To set the record straight
Meet me here, tomorrow night
I promise that I won't be late

'Cause I would do for you
All you'd have me do
And all you have to do
Is ask me to
And all you have to say
Is "steal me away"
And I'll come running back again
I would do for you
All you'd have me do
And all you'd have to do
Is ask me to
And all you have to say
Is "steal me away"
And I'll come running back again
And I'll come running back againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
