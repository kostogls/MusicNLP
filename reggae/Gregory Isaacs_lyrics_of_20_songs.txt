Tell her "try your best" just to make it quick
Come attend to the sick
Cah, there must be something she can do
This heart is broken in two
Tell her it's a case of emergency
There's a patient by the name of Gregory

Night nurse
Only you alone can quench this Jah-thirst
My night nurse (Oh gosh)
Oh, the pain is getting worse

I don't want to see no doc
I need attendance from my nurse around the clock
Cah, there's no prescription for me
She's the one, the only remedy

Night nurse
Only you alone can quench this Jah-thirst
My night nurse
Oh, the pain is getting worse
I'm hurt, my love (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I don't want to see no doc
I need attendance from my nurse around the clock
Cah, there's no prescription for me
She's the one, the only remedy

Night nurse
Only you alone can quench this Jah-thirst
My night nurse
Oh, the pain is getting worse
I'm hurt, my love
And I'm sure; no doctor can cure

Night nurse
Night nurse (Oh gosh)8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Lad-la-la-la

Went to a dance last Saturday night
I was feeling tipsy, the mood was right
Sight a little daughter and a steppin' out the corner
'Cause I feel like dancing all night

But I said, cool down the pace for me little woman
You're dubing it too fast for me
Cool down the pace for me, little woman
That's not how it should be

I told her to try, I dont know why
No use trying 'cause she can't
And, so, she do it how she want

So I said, cool down the pace for me, little woman
You're rocking it too fast for me
Cool down the pace for me, little woman
That's not how it should be
You're rocking too fast for me
Said she would try
But she just don't know why
She keep on trying, but she can't
And, so, she do it how she want (Yeah)

But I beg her, cool down the pace for me, little woman
You're dubing it too fast for me
I said to cool down the pace for me, little woman
That's not how it should be

Please, sister, try
I don't know why
No use trying 'cause you can't
And, so, she do it how she want (Yeah)

But I said, cool down the pace
Please, cool down the pace
You're rocking it too fast
This dance is gonna last

Move a little slower
A move a little slower, not so fast
All night this dance is gonna last
Cool down, cool down, cool down
Not so fast
All night this dance will last
Don't be no haste
Just cool down the pace1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I really wanna know right now

I know you wasn't around when I was slaving myself
Yet you seat back and relax
And you took all the wealth
Is it material things you're running after
Or is it praises that you're giving on to Rasta
I really wanna know right now

I gave a hand onto the wicked
But I give him it with caution
While, I was giving love
He was seeking for reaction (Tell me)
Is it material things you're running after
Or is it praises that you're giving on to Rasta
I really wanna know right now
Yes, I really wanna know right now (Oh, Mister Wicked)

I know you wasn't around when I was slaving myself (Oh, gosh)

You put your trust in vanity
And forget about your liberty
But I really wanna know right now

You are just a material man
And now we get to know, right now
Really wanna know right now

And even if the river should run dry
For me, there'll be nobody else, no, oh, no

But all form of respect unto you is still due
Though staying away make you feel mad, it make you feel blue
But it's not that I really mean to embarrass you, 'cause darling
If I don't, if I don't have you
Then for me there'll be nobody else no, oh no, no

If by chance you've changed your mind
Rest assured that I'll be waiting
Hurry up; I can't go on like this

Without you dear I'm not the same
Can't get over this love I'm missing
Though I try so hard to be strong

In love you win and you lose (win or lose)
You've left me hurt and confused (confused)
But if I had to choose
I'll fall for you again

I've tried to fight the way I feel
I tell myself there'll soon be another
But no one can ever take your place

I've played around I've had a ball
And I think that I've done it all
But in my mind I always see your face
In love you win and you lose (win or lose)
You've left me hurt and confused (confused)
