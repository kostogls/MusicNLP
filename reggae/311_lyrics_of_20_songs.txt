Brainstorm, take me away from the norm
I got to tell you somethin'
This phenomenon, I had to put it in a song
And it goes like

Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

You wanna know what brings me here, oh
You glide through my head, blind to fear
And I know why

Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally


Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

You live too far away
Your voice rings like a bell anyway
Don't give up your independence
Unless it feels so right
Nothing good comes easily
Sometimes you've got to fight
Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

Launched a thousand ships in my heart, so easy
Still, it's fine from afar
And you know that

Whoa, brainstorm, take me away from the norm
Whoa, I got to tell you somethin'21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Today seems like a good day to burn a bridge or two
The one with old wood creaking that would burn right away on cue
I try to be not like that, but some people really suck
People need to get the axing, chalk it up to bad luck

I know a drugstore cowgirl so afraid of getting bored
She’s always running from something, so many things ignored
I might do that stuff if it didn’t make me feel like shit
I’m on some old reality tip, so many trips in it

Beautiful disaster
Flyin' down the street again
I tried to keep up
You wore me out and left me ate up
Now I wish you all the luck
You’re a butterfly in the wind without a care
A pretty train crash to me and I can’t care
I do, I don’t, whatever

I know a drugstore cowgirl so afraid of getting bored
She’s always running from something, so many things ignored
I try to be not like this, but I thought it’d make a good song
There’s nothing to see, shows over, people just move along
Beautiful disaster
Flyin' down the street again
I tried to keep up
You wore me out and left me ate up
Now I wish you all the luck
You’re a butterfly in the wind without a care

Chill
Light on my side as my ego becomes
A funky child with some words on my tongue
Be like intake of breath and my mouth gets loose
So while I scatter my spit, I dream of juice
Have you ever made out in dark hallways?
Displayed a kiss that made the day?
Or, say, play a track from your record collection
It's your mix, congratulations

We changed a lot and then some, some
Know that we have always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you, you
Then just let me do it now

I bet you light up when we start the show
Follow me now, very closely 'cause I told you so
You know we glow because we throw sun rays
Now we be freaky and we want to stay (unh)

We changed a lot and then some, some
Know that we have always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you you
Then just let me do it now
Lighting strikes, yo we be in that violent force of light
Guaranteed to turn it out as bad as Dolemite
Because we're dope, kid, change like the chameleon
And the channel, whatever the whack show the "Real World" is on
You know we dazzle like ghetto box boomin' battles
Rattle inside your head, feel redeemed like cola bottles
Fall in love with your teachers, on the wax we are self made
Check the technique, 311 in LA

We changed a lot and then some, some
Know that we have always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you you
Then just let me do it now

Keep my feet on the ground
Keep my head in the clouds
Electrified by the sound
It comes from the down, and

We changed a lot and then some, some
Know that we have always been down, down
If I ever didn't thank you you
Then just let me do it now8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You’ve got to trust your instinct and let go of regret
You’ve got to bet on yourself now star
‘Cause that’s your best bet

Watch me now with a wicked and wild and I said
We come with the funky style
That gets us known for the show
And we’ll mix the hip hop reggae if we say it is so
And fuck the naysayers cause they don’t mean a thing
‘Cause this is what style we bring

Now it’s morning but last night’s on my mind
There’s something I need to get off my chest
And no matter what may come to shine
The dream will always be mine

All mixed up, you don’t know what to do
Next thing you turn around and find the person is you
Thought a freak might be the thing but the first could be the last
So just get off your ass
All mixed up you don’t know what to do
Next thing you turn around and find the person is you
Thought a freak might be the thing but you know this will pass
So just get off your ass
You’ve got to trust your instinct and let go of regret
You’ve got to bet on yourself now star
‘Cause that’s your best bet

Watch me now with a wicked and wild and I said
Sick sick bit got to have it
Like bustin’ in on a session but you got to call it quits
Sick sick bit just can’t quit
The fact that you don’t even know makes it fully legit

Now it’s morning but last night’s on my mind
There’s something I need to get off my chest
And no matter what will come to shine
The dream will always be mine

You keep me coming
That is a gal that’ll kill them stunning
Keep me coming
That is a gal that’ll kill them stunning
Keep me coming
That is a gal that’ll kill them stunning
Keep me coming
That is a gal that’ll kill them stunning
You make me nervous throat dry
My brain is empty don’t know why
But I saw you doing something
Which is really truly nothing
But you could bust me out all day

Many moons since first I saw you
Many moons since first we did the do
Many moons since first I saw you
Many moons since first we did the do

And why did I try when I knew it was no and
Why did I try when I saw it was so
But save it for late we should just let it skate
'Cause the waiting feel is fine7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
***
Back again I'm holed up
In the waiting room again
Focused on the empty
Getting underneath my skin
How do I keep it?
How do I keep it here?

Look at how the time flies
Burning daylight to the ground
Wash away the ashes
Gonna quiet my head down
How do I keep it?
How do I keep it here?

'Cause I wanna get high
But you're keeping me low
I don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think
I wanna get high
But you're taking me down, down, down
Don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think
Illuminate the shadow
And try to keep the light within (keep the light within)
Avoid another battle
And forget what might have been
How do I keep it?
How do I keep it here?

'Cause I wanna get high
But you're keeping me low
I don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think
I wanna get high (I wanna get high)
But you're taking me down, down, down
Don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I've had too much to think

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of LA
See the faces of the people as they run away
It's a permanent made distraction, the modern reaction
The people don't have to feel the dissatisfaction
It's a slow journey up but a quick ride on down
And nobody here knowing their way around
From the top of the world every which way is down
And who's gonna take the crown?
'Cause I wanna get high (I wanna get high)
But you're keeping me low (But you're keeping me low)
I don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think
I wanna get high (I wanna get high)
But you're taking me down, down, down
Don't got time to waste or time to kill
I've had too much to think

I’ll be here awhile, ain’t going nowhere
I’ll be here awhile, ain’t going nowhere
I’ll be here awhile, ain’t going nowhere
I’ll be here awhile

Far is solace in the maddening pace
Sad state written on my face
Not a tight rope walk but dance
Uncertain game of chance
But I’ll see it through in time

I’ll be here awhile, ain’t going nowhere
I’ll be here awhile, ain’t going nowhere
I’ll be here awhile, ain’t going nowhere
I’ll be here awhile

And if a person, place, or thing can delive I would quiver with delight
Tempted by the hand that could blind my vision and sight
But at twenty years of age
In frolic and in rage
I will see it through in time

I’ll be here awhile, ain’t going nowhere
I’ll be here awhile, ain’t going nowhere
I’ll be here awhile, ain’t going nowhere
I’ll be here awhile

But the dawn has come into the endless night
And everything’s going to be all right
But at thirty years of age
Through frolic and in rage
All regressed and healed in time

I’ll be here awhile, ain’t going nowhere
Said I, said I, said I
I will survive5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Full range of emotion full range of styles
When you come to town you’ll have them comin’ for miles

Come original you got to come original

Black Eyed Peas they comin’ full range and
NOFX they comin’ full range and
Roni Size he comin’ full range
The one Mr. Vegas you know it ain’t easy

A warning to the crews out there who think they’re hot
If you’re not original rockers you will get shot
Down by the kids neglectin’ your art, the stuff you did
Eventually it get so bad it puts you to bed
'Cause when the lightning flashes sweet electricity
All the world then stands revealed with the clarity
Of raw voltage, briefly we see, and the hope is
You’ll be able to tell just what dope is

Come original you got to come original

Funk slap bass mixed with the dancehall and
Hip-hop beats and punk guitar and
Deadly on the mic is the one SA
The name is 311 and you know it ain’t easy

This is not a test there’s no time to mope
How you gonna cope with radioactive isotope
And boss DJ illness upon you now quickly
Infecting you fast upon the airwaves
This message brought to you by the so large system
Activate and attune yourself with meditation
And green plants they’ve got mad life they’re sentient
They’re beautiful as you and they like to dance
(One, two, three, four)

Everything we do we gotta come original
Put your hand up in the air and prepare for battle
Sit upon the rhythm like a tire upon a rim
We do it non-stop and then we do it again
Some a them whine and some a them bitch
They can not do it never switch
Comin’ up from the heart and
Delivered with a wild pitch
Sit up on top the rhythm like a wild stallion
This is the ruling system

Come original you got to come original
All entertainers come original
You got to come original you got to come original

I’ve been spinning in circles
Stuck in the state of contemplate
By the time that you hear this it will be too late
May not do a bit of good
But I cannot stay in a hopeless way
By the time that you hear this it will be too late, too late
Grasping in the darkness
Making it up as I go along
Find what we needed
Right when you read this
It will be too late
Made our way blindly for way too long
Made our way blindly for way too long
It’s human nature’s attraction to danger
You look around but you won’t see the rangers
Just crazy actin' strangers actin' up major, actin' up major
The river cuts it’s way through stone
Not through sheer force but persistence
At the end of the day the relentless always win
If they wanted to stop us
Opportunity passed 'cause they hesitate
By the time that you hear this it will be too late, too late
Grasping in the darkness
Making it up as we go along
Find what we needed
Right when you read this
It will be too late
Made our way blindly for way too long
Made our way blindly for way too long
Only thing to stop us
Or cutting us off of
A road I’ve been told
That ends in a drop off
The universe explodes
New galaxies pop up
New galaxies pop up
Low on gas, going fast, in the passing lane
All the light in the tunnel was an oncoming train
Out of sight, out of mind, and I'm stuck in a bind
That was the end of the line
Lick shot, king of the block
It’s going down another hard knock
That’s all you got
We’ll turn it up in the mix
They'll hear it out in the sticks
Relay the message from the down towns
With loud sounds we expound
It will be too lateEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It is a gift I know
A moment of bliss that we hold
A firecracker flash of light then on to the next plane, soul remain
Come along if you dare
It’s gonna be that you’re scared
Lovely life, I thank you for the reason to see the pain through

Light a candle for the dead
The wick is burning, returning what we have
It’s who we are
We’ll reach you if you’re beyond the furthest star

Don’t give up the fight to stay alive and even if you have to
Find the reason of another’s pain if they lose you
If not for your self then those around who care like I do
One day you’ll see the clear blue

Beyond the Gray Sky
Beyond the Gray Sky
Beyond the Gray Sky

Light a candle…
The wick…
It’s who we are…
One day you’ll see the clear blue
Beyond the Gray Sky
Beyond the Gray Sky
Beyond the Gray Sky

I can’t believe you didn’t call
What made you want to end it all
Wasn’t there something I should have tried
To help you see beyond the gray sky2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Sound boy proceed to blast into the galaxy
Go back rocket man into the sky you’ll see
Hear it all the time, come back rewind
Aliens are waiting up in the sky
Sound boy proceed to blast into the galaxy
Sound boy when you come round
Sound boy won’t you stay
No one gonna harm you
They all want you to play

I watch the birds of prey that
Hunt the canyon below my house
They're looking for a meal like a lizard or a mouse
I wonder if they appreciate the setting like me
To control your own direction choose to be free
And I reserve the right to be as trite as I want
And you can lick but don’t bite I toss you here to Vermont
I kick it lickity split and hand it to the man in the tan van
And as for you and your crew I don’t hate you
Peace is my priority ‘cause marley said for sure-ity
Just what do you think I'm doin’? I’m not just here for screwin’
Yo and if it’s sore take care of it Perhaps from too much sucking
But anytime your aware of it then keep on fucking
You know we cool
(Isn't that random?)
When we come bout people so clear no fear
We're in your ear
You know we will
So get ready
For comes
Picked up so what
(Hey, isn't that random?)
You know
Sound boy
It's gonna rock you
(Hey, isn't that random?)
Oh picked clear
So clear
We're in your ear
You know
People rock steady hey
(Isn't that random?)

To be the one who has it all is not that hard
And I’ll be that type of dude in a funky car
I dream of a suit that will fit my rhyme
When I recognize my girl from a former life
I love it when the only sound that I hear is your infectious laughter
I will hear you again in 800 years if I’m still lucky
Go north on outpost then take a left on mullholland
To me that’s where I like it and macapa drive is callin’
I get up to the sun and then I stretch out
It's beginning to look like summer
And I’m down with no doubt (swing)
You know we cool
(Isn't that random?)
When we come bout make it clear no fear
So dear and we're in your ear
You know people rocksteady
For comes
I Picked up so what

So clear
We're in your ear
You know
People rock steady hey

I break a silly peace for offering
Rap weasel then I’m boffering
I’d give you an exclusive on my playlist
The thought and styles I kick are from a random hat pick
That’s why most radio will never play this tell ‘em again
Me a rude boy from Omaha, Nebraska
Sick as a porno flick yet gold as precious laughter
Many don’t agree but we can’t care about that

When will I stop trying

Spend my time til’ dying, I mean
Champagne, California on the brain
She’s got an appetite for no refrains
Just verses, she curses as blood vessels burst in defiance
She made an alliance to the dark side of Hollywood
Where everything looks good
So I treat her as any other player would
Lightly, then she wants to fight me
Too bad, that’s just too bad
I can’t be around to pick up your bags and your debts
She wants to love me with threats
Not taking chances, I’m hedging my bets
With other girls, I’m not providing pearls
I’m free, free
I will never understand you
When will I stop trying
I mean, 'cause it’s just not how I planned to
Spend my time til’ dying, I mean
I know loving me isn’t easy
I’m home and next thing I’m leaving
But when I look at you it’s like praying with my eyes
I follow you to sleep so I will find
Your dream place and hey, I’m not an angel
But girl you make me feel like I know one, one
Champagne, California on the brain
She’s got an appetite for no refrains
Just verses, she curses as blood vessels burst in defiance
She made an alliance to the dark side of Hollywood

Puttin' on an angle, puttin' on a show
Speaking on nothing makes you a stunt
I’ll tell you right here yo I don’t front
I cross the t’s and skip non-legitimacies
Or else please
I cannot handle all the negative vibe merchants
Is that all you have in you per chance
So much angst and pain it’s so wack
You should take a tip from the one Frank Black
Play some pachinko, play some parcheesi
'Cause all the angst shit is just cheesy

It’s the 311 bliss too smooth for pissed
Lyrics talkin loud again, yeah we are the party men
Cosmetics that you fretted, we sport the high aesthetic
Here go rap kickin the dazzled crazy mathematic
I am what I am mix some old school jams onto tape
'Cause the party’s in the crates I scan step into the realm
What you gonna do
Get the party people something funky to listen to

Misdirected hostility, that’s what you got see
Misdirected hostility, that’s what you got see
Misdirected hostility, that’s what you got see
Misdirected hostility, that’s what you got
Body rock pop and lock here’s an example
Boulevard chrome beats always ampin your temple
Punks get got in the age of hip hop
It’s just begun like stolen bikes on the blacktop born to sing a lyric
Immaculately concepted
No strain in your game if your game is respected
Come as you are radio star
Drown out the hatred with a rhyme
An electric guitar dispatched when rap shattered
The glass of radio access
May we turn some soul on their rhythmless dances
You know the time and they’ll know the scoop
They’ll say it was a rhyme and a beat of a rap group

Your rhymes have been outmoded
Your rhymes have been outmoded
Your rhymes have been outmoded
Your rhymes have been outmoded

Your rhymes have been outmoded
So just quit your belly achin’
You’re saying that your tortured
Give me a fuckin' break and
Maybe take out the source of your dispairing
What do I mean? Kick the fuckin heroin
I speak from experience
Because I didn’t see clearly once
Acting like I dunce
In 1989 I was cocaine and Jim Beam
But now it’s '95 and I’m ginseng

Coming like a nightmare word like I’m gonna go for it
Fuckin’ around what ya got to show for it?
Let it be known that I’m in the zone
And whatever I need I just pick up the phone
‘Cause I’m true with it and you’re new with it
I just swing the thing and then I’m through with it
I don’t need friends to act like foes
‘Cause I’m Nick Hexum the one who knows
About things…
‘Cause it takes two and we swings better than you
Then it’s time for the dub so we roll out the club
And you know just what I do
I’m hitting in the freak mode
Puttin’ on a load
Sippin’ on a guinny then lo and behold
On a vision from bottom to top
And I just can’t stop
311 show them the air is rarified
But you don’t give a damn ‘cause the groove is hellafied
Grew up punk, listening to funk
I’m a hyper type of fella that does not touch junk

You’re the back of the pack and the bottom of the stack
That’s what you get when you’re steady talkin’ shit
Not goin’ for self that shit is on the shelf
It’s '95 and we go for the hive
Listen up this you’re gonna bump to this
And if I’m feelin’ mean I’m gonna clutch my fist
Now when I say mean, I mean I’m gonna rock it
You’re gonna find out kid I’m bout to shock it
When I’m on I’m gone I hear the beat that spawns
The way we freak it and we kick up a storm
The day we turn to pop the show will stop
So feel the beat and get lost now
Back to part two the hard way we play
Sublime on time to all the fans I’m SA
And if you don’t know I say check the show
Do what you got to on the dance floor
Some say the style is wack but I say fuck that
Get the hell back and watch us rock the set
We cast the mold bust it cold explode
Mega trend-setters known around the globe
Friends takin’ you where you never been
We done what we wanted craftin’ poems
You can rock there is a glow around you
Lose control holmes just like we do
Hard to obtain brotha’ what’s my name
Mad to find unlike ya mamma and your masquerade
I drive a mach-1 no dashboard Jesus
I hear voices say "that’s Doug Martinez"
You’re all up in my mix like fuckin’ Betty Crocker
You think you’re playing me but actually you’re a jocker
You bad mouth me bitch man you're givin' me juice
It ain't nothin’ but a party everybody get loose
Notice what I don’t do when stress steps to me
Whatever your complaint, so sue me
I say fuck the naysayers and keep goin
Gotta do what I gotta do to get the people glowin’
So let everybody gather the more the better
I represent the traveler him he’s a shredder
At ease with yourself and don’t try to please me
I’m just here today then quickly I’m out
On the town one light I’m a glow worm
For several hours wiggle jiggle like I’m a huge sperm
Can’t appreciate a brothers love of funky music
You think I’m a silly rabbit ‘cause my style has tricks
Of the way I feel now I just got to rock
The music be poppin through me like electric shocks
I think and blink and I wink but that shit's not tiny
‘Cause in a blink of an eyelash you will not find me

You’re the back of the pack and the bottom of the stack
That’s what you get when you’re steady talkin’ shit
Not goin’ for self that shit is on the shelf

Now I know fools get their own when they chit chat
Haven't heard yet, but you can bet I'm not with that
With that talk, with the digi walk
I struck a bird, you heard, absurd, word to the fact

I'm a cat, nippin', sippin' on the flask
Passin' it, talkin' shit, but only if you're an ass
In front of me 'cause you could run from me but
In the end, revenge send ends to the defendant
I can't get caught in the spiral
'Cause every bit of energy, it goes to my survival
Out my way, I'm a flicka flacka blotter
Ya try to find a weakness, but the shit keeps gettin' harder

Fourth of July
With Lucy in sky
I remember pine trees and the coat of many colors
I was nineteen
I'd do anything
Shit like that now scares me, but I'd like to do it again
It was Independence Day
I've seen the other side and I say
Oh, I've been insane
And I won't ever be the same
'Cause we flow we must be fly
First to flow, Nick, oh my brother, so wise, and then I rise
Nick, he is an ill kid pimpin' 'cause he is so slick
Steps from darkness, his body electric
A drone buzzes the air, a cracklin' tone
Then boomin' like thunder in a cosmic jungle
Death defyin' like Evil Knievel
Words that will wobble awkwards and evil

'Cause he flow and rock the hardest of the crowds
A marvel pow, how you like me now
I've returned the kiss of death, the last Damien
From the abyss, a fresh eternal alien
Now famished from pathless ways, I'ma do damage
To the wack MCs, I know you can't stand this
Right about now, get down, I'm the annihilator
Rockin' with the rhythm of my rhyme detonator

Before you’re pointing at me
There is a possibility
You better turn that thing around
Nothing comes easily
So don’t you tread on me
'Cause I will knock you down

Some days it seems it’s not worth it
The fight in me is all gone
And I’m not trying to be perfect
But just get one damn thing done
Before I lose control
I pick myself off the floor

Before you’re pointing at me
There is a possibility
You better turn that thing around
Nothing comes easily
So don’t you tread on me
'Cause I will knock you down

Never come a day that I’ll solve you
Consequently I could never leave you
In the shadow of those looming battleships
I love our canoe
I’m ready for the falls
And the still waters we will find our truth
Oh, there’s a clock in my head
And despite what it said
Another one on the wall
They don’t agree at all
And there’s a schism in me
And despite what you see
You might see me as calm
But I go off like a bomb

Before you’re pointing at me
There is a possibility
You better turn that thing around
Nothing comes easily
So don’t you tread on me
'Cause I will knock you down

Oh, in the comfort of strangers
You don’t see the danger
Of just letting it flow
This I know

There is a possibility
You better turn that thing around
Nothing comes easily
So don’t you tread on me

My name is volatile

I’d surely like to rest but the energy gets the best of me and
It’s been a wild ride
I wouldn’t change a minute
I can’t slow down inside, guess that’s why I live it
(Watch it now!)

The years of mischief
Followed by weeks of thrift
I land on earth’s hard face
No legs could keep that pace
And through the rest I sift

Is there ever a time
When the state of sleeping willingly leaves my mind

Highly frustrated wanna feel elated
Come Monday morn', you feel checkmated
You can be uncool and become the rule
Exceptions were made to drown
I’m not used to it, you’d think I’d be by now
The ins, the outs, the ups and the downs

I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures for a while
I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures, just creatures

It comes and goes and comes and goes
Sometimes I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do

I know what you were gonna say
But were afraid to cause dismay
Your lyrics switched around
The mixture watered down
And now a pointless display
It’s something one won’t understand
Unless they're in it with me hand in hand

Don’t buy the fear, don’t buy that my dear
The things you love you must keep near and
Carry on and you won’t feel withdrawn
Even if you’re coming down

Sometimes it’s wearable, sometimes it's bearable
I careen towards balance til’ the glass is full

I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures for a while
I wanna make a mess
I wanna blow off stress
I wanna stoke the fire
Just creatures, just creatures
It comes and goes and comes and goes

Sometimes
Sometimes I get a little out there
Sometimes I go off
Sometimes just like you
I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do
Sometimes I go a little crazy
Sometimes I go a little crazy just like you I do1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hey!
Check it out
You got clout and you know that

Large in the margin, my drama unfolds behind closed doors
Told on the down low I believe that I’m sold but really, I don’t know
Maybe it’s better but I can’t think so
Maybe it’s better to fight, one never ever knows
Believe the rumors that grow like tumors
It’s more fun than the truth that we know
Trying to hard to reach a higher plain

Will fuck you up when you least expect it
You think you’re moving closer when suddenly you wrecked it
But all the same the pain gains wisdom
As if you ain’t had enough then you’re in some
Prison of your own creation mental dilation
Look at what you’re facing placing blame in every direction
But in the end it’s your own infection

There’s no way to avoid listening
You’ll always end up listening
Here’s hoping the voices aren’t too unkind
Here’s hoping the voices are benign
It’s easier when you hear it
There’s no reason to fear it
It’s you, you
You think they’ll probably find you
Well then, you’re probably right
'Cause they’ll come back to remind you for eternity
Of when you gave up the fight
Somehow they always will find you
The voices in the night, every night
Keep coming back to remind you for eternity
Of when you gave up the fight

There’s no way to avoid listening
You’ll always end up listening
Here’s hoping the voices aren’t too unkind
Here’s hoping the voices are benign
It’s easier when you hear it
There’s no reason to fear it
It’s you, you2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If you want more beats for your buck there’s no luck
If you want more beats for your buck there’s no luck
If you want more beats for your buck there’s no luck
Then there’s no luck
Then again if you came for drama then I can’t understand
Music critics, music critics
Not afraid of a guy who’ll tell you he’s never been in a mix
Been in a mix, been in a mix
We’re from the grassroots so big up to our friends
Every crew, every clique, and every posse
Big up to all the heads not of hypocrisy

You’re a transistor
Lightning resistor
Conducting to the mother star
That’s what you are
Yeah, yeah

Brothers from another planet and here once again
Automatic, automatic
Quantum saints of the universe in a holographic
Cosmic remix, cosmic remix
From the mysterious blue planet we can breathe anywhere
Underwater, out in space, and in L.A
Your polluted air’s no problem for these homeys
You’re a transistor

I believe in your purpose baby
Coming up to the surface and maybe
I’ll never see you again, then again, who knows?
Make me quiver, hands will shiver
Still got all the things that I woulda give her
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
But it’s slow going, something’s showing, yeah, yeah

They say love is a stream that will find its own course
Making due is a thing, a thing I will do no more
Whenever you come back I’ll be waiting
Trifling the slack, no head gating
This is all pure fiction, you know that’s right
Just pure fiction, that’s alright

I believe in your purpose baby
Coming up to the surface and maybe
I’ll never see you again, then again, who knows?
Make me quiver, hands will shiver
Still got all the things that I woulda give her
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
But it’s slow going, something’s showing, yeah, yeahEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
