Doesn't make sense now
Shit just got real, things are gettin' intense now
I hear you talkin' 'bout "We" a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like "Do you wanna hang right now?"
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's askin' a lot of you right now

All she talkin' bout is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she ever say is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"

I been up for two whole days thinkin' what I did to keep you goin'
Thumbin' through the voicemails that you left me tellin' me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded, no (Yeah, you said that)
And I believed you when they told me don't
(Yeah, I thought you meant that)
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you
Swear these days all you say is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she hit me with is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once, oh
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"

Why you gotta start, girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standin' in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questionin' what you get out the deal
Doin' things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm comin' home?
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking like inside of your place
Or how it's decorated
This thing is gettin' one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now
Yeah

All she talkin' bout is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she hit me with is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"135EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Celebration on me, well what's up
Pay homage, I roll through the city like young Sheikh Mohammed
It can't be that hard to find us
Go to Jungle, pick up my Ethiopian goddess
That's when words spread, a Bugatti is in the projects
The boy home, used to take the bus to the block
Now summertime whips come through and bust up the block
I remember seeing Nikk's having to bust up a block
And sell the work right to hush, y'all niggas must have forgot
But I was there Nas don shit, a couple things sit on my conscience
With that said, look at all we accomplished
Yea, sure this ain't Compton but this ain't a fairytale land neither
We all lost mad people, the city wild
They gave the task to a purposeful child
Verses start to get a little more personal now
But that’s cause everybody else sound is so played out though
Oliver North in the cut Dolce'd out though
A thousand dollar bottle it get poured straight out though
I'm screaming OVO on the whole way out though
I'm back boy for real, I'm that boy for real
I got hits nigga, you just a batboy for real
Backwoods get peeled, I smoke away all the tears
Nothing was the same man, including y'all careers
The new Cash Money, the new Roc-A-Fella
Bunch of young rich niggas, turn around if you jealous
