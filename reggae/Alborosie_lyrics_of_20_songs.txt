Some man have no money, still ah try fi beg a ting
If you no drop no green, ah straight up dissing ting
Sun ah bun traffic, it's a slow riddim
JCF ah move ruff, dem buss di M-16,
Some man ah drive up and down, dem have di latest ting
Machine fit inna dem jeans ah show off girls and bling
Smell of marijuana round di corner dem juggling
One mad man get him food straight out ah di garbage bin
Ay!

Sipple it down-down
Sipple it down-down
It's a rudeboy town
It's Kingston town

Dis ah di gun land
Blood run cold pon di white sand
Concrete ah bun but some part up your team bad
Babylon bwoy dem kill a youth, an one old woman a chant psalm
While a next set ah man start di rat-ta-ta-tan-tan
Dem dig more grave than rooms up ah Hilton
Small community get wash out by a blood storm
Every weekend same routine whole new function
Push and dem count more dead than 9/11 destruction
Ay!
Sipple it down-down
Sipple it down-down
It's a rudeboy town
It's Kingston town

Di gyal dem pants tight like rubber suit
And ah dem blouse one tiny sup'm hide up perfect boobs
Dem always ah smile if you ago pay di I
Dem ago play you one trick if you ah mama's bwoy
It's a tuff man town, there's no crown and no throne
It ago, lick you down, with a, dancehall sound
If you a stranger and you ah drive, mek sure you know the route
You don't wanna get salute by a gun dispute

Inna the streets busy life is a chapper
While you at you work you affi stay on the upper
Those who disagreed choose the way of a Dapper
Those who blend right  in choose the book and the laptop
Who have hears to hear listen to what mama said
Sit down Inna church and  be quiet and pray
You taking on the wrong pledge
Your life not granted
So your story echoes in my head

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

This is the story of a man I used to know
He never listen to his dad an mama words
He found shelter inna wrong place
Friends with a screw face
Then Killed by their wrong ways
Justice no kind
It's vision blind
Forward with the sentence
No judge can't rewind
Rest indeed yoooh
Rest in peace bro
Rest in me
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

There's still place that once you called your own
Not a war zone not a funeral home
Silent, no more music, no sound
Under the moonlight inna a Small town
Guiltiness rest on their shoulder
So for the wicked man
His days are numbered
Rest indeed
Rest In peace
Rest in me
What I've felt
What I've known
Never free
Never me
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I and I hold a meditation and be stand in reverence
Babylon press di trigga nuh Rasta nah go jump the fence
A wah do dem dead dem catch a mental pestilence
Di cross and di rifle a fi dem ultimate defence
Di temple of di Most High neva build upon di earth
Why you pastor pray and purify your actions inna di church
Cursed be di one who nah go put God first
Nevamore shall be di one who dash it thought inna di dirt

This got be the first trumpet, might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die, don't ask me why
There's a natural mystic blowin' through the air
Such a natural mystic blowin' through the air

This could be the first trumpet, might as well could be the last
Watch di wicked dreadful man a drownin' inna one glass
Judgement a go lick down every race and social class
Armageddon control come and put we all 'pon past

There's a natural mystic blowin' through the air
Such a natural mystic blowin' through the air
We comin' in from the cold and so we marchin' to di light
Jah Jah people stop di tension got a dream let's get unite
It's natural and mystic, you must feel it inna di air
If you don't feel it simply mean seh all this time you neva care
I'm the child, I'm the man, I'm the messenger, the slim
I'm the keepa have di secret, the one who run the game
I see the prophecy di legacy, di Bible is my soul
Jah please bless up me chantin' and just take it to di worl'

There's a natural mystic blowin' through the air
Such a natural mystic blowin' through the air

Okay
Yeah, yeah
Alborosie say
Strolling inna town with Protoje
Well well
Tell the people

Over the mountains, across the seas
And when they need it, then they send for me
The Rastaman strolling into town
The fyah man strolling into town
Over the mountains, across the seas
You feel it mystically in the breeze
When the Rastaman strolling into town
The fyah man strolling into town

Them a hail you an' a praise you
Me no trust when dem a talk
Words a fly over me head like shooting stars
Me see dem inna garrison, stage shows and bars
Mouth a talk peace, but dem heart a beat war
The truth is taking off like copa
Rastafari youth dem shining like a supernova
Protoje and Alborosie them a no push over
Strong signal straight from Selassie I router
Over the mountains, across the seas
And when they need it, then they send for me
The Rastaman strolling into town
The fyah man strolling into town
Over the mountains, across the seas
You feel it mystically in the breeze
When the Rastaman strolling into town
The fyah man strolling into town

Well, the thing yah balance from the woofer to the twetter
Can't get it better flawless like a Lupita
Oh no, they wanna be your friend to get a feature
Disciples them a coulda Judas, coulda Peter
One will tek yuh life and one would never leave yah
Pray for the wisdom so you know before it reach yah
When to be the student, when to be the teacher
When fi talk you mind and when fi never ever speak
And 'pon that note you know I probably shouldn't say
But them man deh the business looking sloppy from weh day
Topic a the day, animosity fi popularity
Haffi stop it microscopic a the pray
Take a look a panoramic me a say
While them sit down and a watch them Panasonic every day
So when Alborosie call me and say 'Yeh'
Link up and drop it internationally
Over the mountains, across the seas
And when they need it, then they send for me
The Rastaman strolling into town
The fyah man strolling into town
Over the mountains, across the seas
You feel it mystically in the breeze
When the Rastaman strolling into town
The fyah man strolling into town

If you can't walk neither fly, you should run like a train
Maybe Usain should ah say it
Take me inna capsule just like a pain killer
Listen to my music while you puffing sensimilla
Apart from the business, music ever inna me heart
Music from me heart so Selassie take the charts
All Zion youth him a sing about that
That show you seh we all inna one class

Over the mountains, across the seas
And when they need it, then they send for me
The Rastaman strolling into town
The fyah man strolling into town
Over the mountains, across the seas
You feel it mystically in the breeze
When the Rastaman strolling into town
The fyah man strolling into town, heyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

An' who di hell you think you are, I'm not Jah superstar
Mi nah drink di gold wine and smoking cigar
And I don't drive di satan's car, with jesus mi a par
I'm just a revolutionary fighting my own war
A mi name Alberto D'Ascola, dont hitch pon it
I'm very humble, don't yuh ask, I just walk with it
Down inna Jamaica life no pretty, mi no ramp with it
White boy a prove himself to di world and crew it's fumbling
I left my mother dropping tears just to chase a dream
Mi hit my time, son your empire was in slavery
Di wicked man stole mi life and I identity
So watch yourself and watch your mouth before you judging mi
An' who di hell you think you are, I'm not Jah superstar
Mi nah drink di gold wine and smoking cigar
And I don't drive di satan's car, with jesus mi a par
I'm just a revolutionary
Mi bredda died, he was killed by bandits in di streets
My father try , and him still a dweet
At certain points I war with god and satan was da shit
And then one day Selaissie come and save mi from di trick
Oh well, so here I am, di puppet of your show
The man on stage that sing some stuff that yuh don't know
The clown a pleased da crowd and can appease his soul
The artist with da funny name, a fun it go
The price fi come to give for yur culcha and di money dat you earn
The idiot boy want little bit in return
An' who di hell you think you are, I'm not Jah superstar
Mi nah drink di gold wine and smoking cigar
And I don't drive di satan's car, with jesus mi a par
I'm just a revolutionary fighting my own war
Who you think you are, I'm not Jah superstar
Mi nah drink di gold wine and smoking cigar
And I don't drive di satan's car, with jesus mi a par
I'm just a revolutionary fighting my own war
I had a gun right on my face and I was scared to die
I sex so many girl so, mi did nah tell nuff lie
I was alcoholic and depressed, one day I'll tell you why
So just for now we leave it so, so please just give mi a bly
An' who di hell you think you are, I'm not Jah superstar
Mi nah drink di gold wine and smoking cigar
And I don't drive di satan's car, with jesus mi a par

This is for my people
Oh my Jah Jah people
The conquering Lion, shall come
(Oh, yeah yey)

I don't want to live in the past
So I'm looking for a brand new day
My homeland is right there behind the horizon
God Almighty watch me same way
Someone is judging my spirituality
Laughing at my meditation
Don't be afraid of diversity
There is no confliction
Blessed shall be the one
Who live in love, respect and dedication
Blessed shall be the one, who live in love
 
Love you, King Selassie
Promise you I'll keep your crown
Love you King Selassie
No man will bring me down

Live in love and life shall bloom
God is waiting there
Don't be scared of where you're going
'Cause you don't really nowhere
Simple people with simple life
We don't seek perfection
For many years we've been living in
One life of illusion
 
Love you, King Selassie
Promise you I'll keep your crown
Love you King Selassie
No man will bring me down

I don't want to live in the past
So I'm looking for a brand new day
My homeland is right there behind the horizon
God Almighty watch me same way
Someone is judging my spirituality
Laughing at my meditation
Don't be afraid of diversity
There is no confliction
Blessed shall be the one
Who live in love, respect and dedication
Blessed shall be the one, who live in love
 
Love you, King Selassie

Mystical Reggae

History of Reggae
We have come a long long way (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, oooii)
Mystical Reggae
Music that the I-Drens love to play (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

From then till now we nah stap sow
The seed 'affi plant and grow
Must say I'm proud to see its growth
From the vinil shops to sound cloud
While the pioneers who set it
Me give credit
Too much to mention
But I don't forget it
Wise up yourself like King Solomon weed
Teach yourself some history

History of Reggae
We have come a long long way (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, oooii)
Mystical Reggae
Music that the I-Drens love to play (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Everything start from scratch
From when the artist them a' do it for the love an' not cash
Long before the first sound clash
Long before sting, rebel, salute
Sunfest and sunsplash
When yuh shirt and pants mismatch
An' mama tell me no bother with the locks
And di dance ram from 10 o'clock
Selector play Dennis Brown, Bob Marley and Tosh

History of Reggae
We have come a long long way (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, oooii)
Mystical Reggae
Music that the I-Drens love to play (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

I'm looking through the eyes of a rebel
I see their corruption in red
And just like my foreparents did too
I'm keeping it dreader than dread
Steppin in Bablyon wit no fear
Sing against the people and never give care
Chant like Abyssian's Burning Spear
There's a natural mystic inna di air
History of Reggae
We have come a long long way (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, oooii)
