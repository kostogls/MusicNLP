Out in the street, they call it murder

Welcome to Jamrock
Camp whe' the thugs dem camp at
Two pound a weed inna van back
It inna yuh hand bag, yuh nap sack
It inna yuh back pack
The smell a give yah girlfriend contact
Some bwoy nuh know dis
Dem only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories, and pose like dem name Chuck Norris
And don't know the real hardcore
'Cause Sandals ah no "Back-To"
Di thugs dem wi' do whe' dem got to
And won't think twice to shot you
Don't mek dem spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
A bear tuff thing come at you
When Trenchtown man stop laugh and block off traffic
Den dem wheel and pop-off and dem start clap it
With the pin file down and it a beat rapid
Police come inna jeep an' dem can't stop it
Some say dem ah playboy, a playboy rabbit
Get drop like a bad habit
So nuh bother pose tuff if you don't have it
Rastafari stands alone
Welcome to Jamrock
Welcome to Jamrock
Out in the street, they call it murder

Welcome to Jamdown
Poor people a dead at random
Political violence, can't done
Bare ghost and Phantom
The youth dem get blind by stardom
Now the king of kings ah call
Old man to pickney, so wave unno hand if you with me
To see the sufferation sick me
Dem suit nuh fit me
To win election dem trick we
Den dem don't do noting at all
Come on, let's face it, a ghetto education's basic
And most of the youths dem waste it
And when dem waste it
That's when dem tek the guns replace it
Then dem don't stand a chance at all
And that's why ah nuff little youth have up some fat 'matic
With the extra magazine inna dem back pocket
And a bleach a night time inna some black jacket
All who nah lock Gloc, say dem a lock rocket
Dem wi full you up a current like ah shock socket
Dem wi run a road block which part the cops block it
And from now till a morning nuh stop clock it
If dem run outta rounds ah bruck-back ratchet

Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority

Di youngest veteran a come murder dem slow
Raggamuffin sent to call me from di bush bungalow
Mi nuh watch it mek I clear out my voice now, Figaro
Emerge from the darkness with mi big blunt a glow
Di hammer dem a slam and spectator getta low
Some bwoy could a big like Bam Bam Bigelow
Buss off trigger finger, trigger hand and trigger toe
A two gun mi have mi buss dem inna stereo, 'cause

I got to keep on walkin', on the road to Zion, man
Hey, we got to keep it burnin', on the road to Zion, man

Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem take you like who dem took out
Jah will be waitin there we a shout

In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority

Instead of broken dreams and tragedy
By any plan with any means and strategy, say

Sometimes, I can't help but feel helpless
I'm havin' daymares in daytime, wide awake, try to relate
This can't be happenin' like I'm in a dream while I'm walkin'
'Cause what I'm seein' is hauntin'
Human beings like ghost and zombies
President Mugabe holdin' guns to innocent bodies in Zimbabwe
They make John Pope seem Godly, sacrilegious and blasphemous
In my lifetime, I look back at paths I walked
Where savages fought and pastors taught
Prostitutes stomp in high-heel boots
And badges scream at young black children: "Stop, or I will shoot!"
I look back at cooked crack, plush cars that pass by
Jaguars mad fly
And I'm guilty for materialism
Blacks is still up in the prison, trust that
So save me your sorries, I'm raisin' a army
Revolutionary warfare with Damian Marley
We sparkin' the ions, marchin' to Zion
You know how Nas be, N.Y.C. state of mind I'm in
In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns we nuh know bout variety, boom

Di youngest veteran a come murder dem slow
Ragamuffin sent to God before di bush bungalow
Mi nuh watch it mek I carry out my voice now figarow

You're the prettiest of flowers, girl me can't complain
When I'm with you I feel so high I rise above the rain
And you no do people damage, like that bitch cocaine, no
And leave them lonely, feeling only pain
Cause your DNA is of the highest strain
Your effect is so potent, it's so insane
You so gummy and sticky like a plasticine
When me grind out your body, only stems remain
And to love you is so risky, I might get detained
You always keep me flying on the highest plane
And anybody know, will always proclaim

Look how Babylon so duppy, dem fight you fi years
Fi your love whole heap a man serve years
Babylon so duppy, dem fight you fi years
And now the whole a dem a buy shares

Across the seven seas, for your energy

For the remedies in your recipes, whoa

No cross pollination, she's a real pure breed
Cultivated in love and she's not grown for greed
She's everything I want and also all I need

And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more

Well did you know the pen
Is stronger than the knife
And they can kill you once
But they can't kill you twice
Did you know destruction of the flesh
Is not the ending to life
Fear not of the anti-christ
Did you know that I
Exist before the earth
And did you know my eyes
Are windows to the world
Did you know you can't go to Zion and wear jheri curls
Can't tell the boys from the girls
Your body’s just a vehicle
Transporting yo' soul
It's what’s inside ah people
Is beauty to behold
Fear not of evil
Everyday dem flesh it grow old
Changes of the times take the toll
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more

The one ya name, fear is in the eyes of the beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer
Fear is in the eyes of the beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer

A vest around his chest and Rastafari is his name
The gift of everlasting life for us to all sustain
Blessing that you all begot
Lessons that you all forgot
Rasta call it shit you not
Do you remember Elijah
And his chariot of flames
Same blood that runs thru my veins
The one ya name, fear is in the eyes of the beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer
Fear is in the eyes of di beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer
Careful how you entertain stranger
Selassie never born inna nuh manger
And I'm never crucify as nuh savior
Elect off himself inna the ruler
Babylon ah nah malfunction well dem a failure
So be careful of dem cellular and pager
Cause I sign see dem I see danger
So dem great but Selaisse I greater

That a man shall
Endure forever more
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more
Me think me wanna lick upon shots
Upon a bloodclot
And fill the block with bumbaraas cops
Cops mi dun talk you know you watch me walks in
While black woman is getting raped across New Yorks And
Before another brother's in chalks And
I imagine somebody said that's your son dead, see him?
See us we do the crime we do the time
Y'all get away scott-free
So police mi gonna pop you before you pop me
Cause if you get me you got me you shot me
Know'll lot me carry shotty since moms slap me
Cause my room sloppy
The youngest nigga out the camp is me
But nobody pampered me
So you better don't ramp with me
Fi see me, me don't play plenty
Chicks me blazed many
Raised plenty fi dollars
Storm upon mi prada
Watch a bomb holla
Watch 'im run, hit the floor
Told I'm come, come no
Throw ya ganja pon de air
'plah!'

And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more

So watch for sticks and stones, stumbling blocks in piles
Life is one big road, miles on top of miles
So blessed be the soul that always remains a child
When most people don't even smile
There's a natural mystic, blowing tru the air
So keep it realistic, and always be aware
The truth is crying out, and it's so loud and so clear
But most people won't even hear
Spiritual pollution in the atmosphere
And with so much confusion, can one be happy here
The gift of Rastafari is for all man to share
But some would rather to be so unfair

And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more
And it was written

Affairs of the hearts
Together we’ve grown
If ever apart
All I want you to know
Is your love is life changing
And I couldn’t be the same without you darling
Your love is life saving
You always catch me when I fall

When the tour bus drop off
And all light lock off and I’m a mere mortal again
Promoter belly full and all the fans gone home
I’m glad that you’re more than a friend
Woman your love is life changing
And I couldn’t be the same without you darling
Your love is life saving
You always catch me when I fall
There’s people just like you and me
We pass them in the traffic
That never fall in love and so me have it say me lucky
‘nuff a dem nuh fortunate enough to have somebody
Some just cannot see beyond the flesh and its so funny
Never get too caught up in yourself to feel the magic
True love come and pass you by in life that is so tragic
Opportunity is scarce so take it while you have it
Nuh wait ‘til you a panic
Well the last man yu deh wid mek a big mistake
Lef’ an’ gone fi good and miss out something weh great
Loyal and full a faith when nuff a dem a move fake
Our ting separate we can’t separate
‘cause I would miss you baby
And I can’t do without you darling
Yes and I would miss you baby
Girl yu know I love you bad

Affairs of the heart
Together we’ve grown
If things fall apart
All I want you to know
Woman your love is life changing
And I couldn’t be the same without you darling
Your love is life saving
You always catch me when I fall
When I’m away it’s like my songs all waste because you’re not near to hear me
If I lost my way I’d know I’d be ok ‘cus you’d be there to care me
And woman I can see tings clearly
You genuine because you love sincerely
You never let me down not even nearly
Not even barely
Girl you know I love you bad
Some see the laughter and don’t see the tears
Some see the courage and don’t see the fear
Some for themselves and they don’t intend to share
Some say a love and only pretend to care
Well nuff a dem a just miss congeniality
Dem pretty face and dem nah face reality
Well dem a quantity woman you a quality
Girl yu know I love you bad

Affairs of the heart
Together we’ve grown
If ever apart
All I want you to know

I couldn’t be the same without you darling

For some of them it's a phase thing (Wo-Oooah)
So they're gazing
On the street lights
Till dem catch up in street fights
Cause are pretending they're street wise
And put a end to a brief life
I feel Like
It's a mystery (Wo-Oooah)
How we keep repeating our history (Wo-Oooah)
Making the same mistakes as our ancestry (Wo-Oooah)
Seems like all of life lessons missed we (Wo-Oooah)
It's risky
So give praises
One day you may find your oasis
Rise up to the challenge you're faced with
Be upful and creative
You'll make it
It's basics (Wo-Oooah)
People been doing it for ages (Wo-Oooah)
Many other cultures and places (Wo-Oooah)
On a regular basis (Wo-Oooah)
There’s so many cases
Lets face it, man
Way too much time has been wasted, man
Building military bases
Fighting a war with no basis
Life is sacred (Wo-Oooah)
And every baby born naked (Wo-Oooah)
Some man ah gwaan like dem raise big (Wo-Oooah)
And don't care what they're making (Wo-Oooah-oh)

You'll be doing good my brother
You're working for the greatest cause

May he throw the first stone
And not even a pebble can cast

Two sides to a coin
And one must chose which side they join
You know?
Brotherman
Yeah
And meanwhile one man's meal
Is another man's poison
Mankind will do what they must to survive
Innit
Hear me now

In a gunman world
Any night him clock in at work
Marrow splatter, the toolbox pull
The magazine inna the two Glock full
And he's watching as the days go by
And he's counting as his peers all die
Sleeping with the rifle 'cross his chest
So he never gets a good night's rest
And then he's cranky in the morning times
And more victims have to lose their lives
The community a twist and twirl
Wishing that they wasn't in a gunman world
In a gunman life
He might not come home from work one night
So every minute matter
Ignores advice
From his weeping baby mother and child
That he won't win every game he plays
So she know he'll meet his end one day
Some juvenile will have to earn his stripe
And have to take another gunman's life
What if a backstabber names his price
And how ironic if him dead from knife
The 'mount of bullet weh him put 'pon boy
Job description: kill and destroy

Now tell me is it worth it all?
If one don rise then a next must fall
Tell me is it worth it all?
Those sleepless nights on patrol roll call
Tell me is it worth it all?
One child smile while a next one bawl
Tell me is it worth it?
Is it worth it?
Is it worth it all?

Well in a gunman world
Life is so stressful
Back to school time come
'cuz when a gunman work
If he is successful
And the job is well done
Then there will be an unsolved crime
With no one to fill out all blank line
John Public haffi hear and deaf
Informer get a kuff, kaff, kweff
Does he get nervous just like you and I?
Watching out if the police pass by
'cuz any day you hear a gunman fail
Then it's either dead house or jail
What will it cost to make a gunman rich?
How many lives before a gunman switch?
The truth me want the youth them stop ignore
Say the majority of gunman poor, oya oh
Now tell me is it worth it all?
If one don rise then a next one fall
Tell me is it worth it all?
Those sleepless nights on patrol roll call
Tell me is it worth it all?
One child smile while a next one bawl
Tell me is it worth it?
Is it worth it?
Is it worth it all?

And when a gunman makes choice
I wonder what goes through a gunman's mind
And does a gunman think twice?
Before him takes another someone's life?
I wonder what it is a gunman say
To the Father when a gunman pray
Does he kiss his kids to bed at night?
Making sure the blanket tucked just right?
Nothing no scary like a gunman voice
When people beg a gunman think twice
And him say no
Wha coulda scary like a gunman voice
When people beg a gunman think twice
And him say no
Can you tell me is it worth it all?
If one don rise then a next must fall
Tell me is it worth it all?
Those sleepless nights on patrol roll call
Tell me is it worth it all?
One child smile while a next one bawl
Tell me is it worth it?
Is it worth it?
Is it worth it all?5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Black Thought from the legendary Roots crew in the flesh
I slid up in here with the brothers from the Marley family, crestin, we 'gon set for y'all

Hey! She loves to party, have a good time
She looks so hearty, feeling fine
She loves to smoke, sometimes shifting coke
She's laughing when there ain't no joke, hey!!!

(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was, now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was

Cause coke was a thing that once she first tried
Was once a blue moon to once a blue sky
And now she's wonderin who else wants to go buy
She don't got no money and wants to get high
Story sounds familiar like born to be wild
But she sillier, not quite the same but she similiar
A waste of a sarsaparilla
Used to look good in the videos now she look hideous
Now it's broken crack pipes with lipstick traces
Work the cold nights red district places
She seen more hotels then my tour suitcases
More male customers than Old Navy
She love limelight more than John Swayze
Seen more miles than a rental, Avis
She don't slow down then some day maybe
She lost then she can't find her way to safety

Check it out! She keep her head up in space like a satellite
Because she got a insatiable appetite
For stayin out late night with all the parasites
Plottin on the way to cop a little piece of paradise
Her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice
Just get the monkey off her back and she be back in like
Five minutes, she stay on the move
She done smoked up the stone that the builder refused
All coked up, alone she ain't even in tuned
And it's sad cause she ain't really have a reason to use
She was a pretty girl cleaner than the board of health, studied and enjoyed herself
I don't know what drove her to avoid herself
Destroyed herself and took a taste of the yay
And now she on the track workin while she wastin away
It's safe to say she lookin for some place to stay
Whoever got a lil' paper to play could get a slice of this..
 (Background Singers)
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was, now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was
For no reason a seasoned spliff was the first thing
One spring season while she's out flirtin
Now she season me and don't need rehearsin
Esteem get a beatin', life is uncertain
Ego need feedin now no one's mercy
Beneath the demons she's a warm person
When she's not fiendin swearin and cursin
Behind the curtain she's really hurtin
And while her people don't even trust her at home
The dealer that bring and cook the rock down
And she without sinnin will spot the first stone
The feelin kicks in she's in the dark zone
Old friends walk pass goin bout their own
As if she is someone that they don't know
Then the King Of Kings lift her off the floor
Sayin life is a thing when you learn you grow
 (Background Singers)
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was, now
(Pimpa's paradise) That's all she was

She rise and fall like a star, her life write off like a car
Her face full of all kind of scar, always quick fi start a war
She can't keep herself up to par, she plays like a broken guitar
She always want take it to far
I doubt she ah go make it too far
She rise and fall like a star, her life ride off like a car
Her face full of all kind of scar, always with fist start a war
She can't keep herself up to par, she plays like a broken guitar
She always want take it too far
Mi wonder if she make it so far, wuy!!!!5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I can remember when huh those slavery times...

What you won't and what you will
Working for your dollar bill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Walking home, a youth gets killed
Police free to shoot at will
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Nine to five you know the drill
Weekends are a short lived thrill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Cup runneth over till it spill
Take until they've had their fill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still

Some of us think we're too big
'Cause the system gives us jobs
Even though it's just a low paying gig
Some of us will boast and brag
And those of us who think we're small
Just because we don't have much
That's really not the case at all
There's riches that the flesh can't touch
Some of us won't respect names
Some of us won't respect loves
Some of us don't respect life
Even though we worship God
And some of us won't let go faith
No matter what the price may cost
Some of us won't practice hate
Because we still believe in love
What you won't and what you will
Working for a dollar bill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Walking home, a child gets killed
Neighbors free to shoot at will
Hurt' to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Nine to five, we know the drill
Weekends are such a short-lived thrill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Cup runneth over till it spill
Take until they've had their fill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still

Most of us think we're too good
Just because material gain
If we were living as we should
Then less of us would be in pain
Those who are misunderstood
Still deserve a voice to claim
The things that are still meaningful
To each and all of us the same
And some will say the cups are full
And give Jah thanks to what we've gained
And some will say there's much more weight to pull
And them will tell you that straight up and plain
And some will think outside the box
While some of us will hold our lanes
And some of us we write the facts
While some of us a chop down cane
What men won't and what they will
Working for a dollar bill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Walking home, a child gets killed
Police free to shoot at will
Hurts to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Nine to five you know the drill
Weekends are a short-lived thrill
Sad' to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow but grinding still
Cup runneth over till it spill
Take until they've had their fill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still

Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Those slavery times... I can remember when huh...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When one duty start it's when one duty stop, one nine to five, one five to twelve o'clock
You see me

Beautiful, Here we go again
My love, you know, I will never let you go
My love, beautiful. Here we go

And I remember when we met and we began dating, and everything was copacet' and we began mating
And the way then the way mi love her good, she gimme don ratings
Because mi style dem plentiful and ah nuh one way thing
And she get her belly full and ah nuh pot scrapings, and the closer we become the more she gravitating
Until we buckle down and there is no escaping
Now it typically become an everyday thing, regulary physically communitcating
Sexually, scientifically penetrating, until she start spiritually resonating
Ah so mi know she real and seh she ah nuh play thing
She is the only Queen the King is desognating, I know it's kinda deep but keep on concentrating
Cause jazzy lay di beat and I am clearly stating
Beautiful, Here we go again
My love, you know, I will never let you go
My love, beautiful. Here we go

And me and she we trampoose alot, several mornings she shampoos my locks
Always have my back she standing true to dat mi ya da general I'mma chew for that

Here we go
My big ego is gonna get me in trouble
Trying to play hero
My jeans can't tight like Michael Phelps speedo
We no play follow fashion, when we lead out
Now looky here, my big ideas
Gonna get me in trouble now amongst my peers
But have no fear, no bother cry tears
You're just miles ahead when I'm ahead light years

(Here.. here I come again)
Gong originally, run fi the grand finale
(Have no fear.. for it is only I)
I do it regularly, through every hill and valley
(I'm here to teach you only truth)
It's Mister Warm and Easy
Somebody please believe me
(For the things you do, Jah is watching you)

Man a wah do some likkle bomboclaated
Weh feel like them big 'cause dem album charted
Well all bad card will be disregarded
No punk cyaan finish weh what Bob Marley started
Gong to the Zilla, I'm the Don Die-Hearted
Anywhere me go, dem roll out red carpet
Some man a buy car and nah no house fi park it
Nah unify dem selfish like market
Dem sell out dem souls just to be rewarded
Bleach out dem skin, dem favour dead to rahtid
Soul too corrupt and dem blemish and faulted
Real Rastaman we cannot be outsmarted
Gong's not the one fi a bwoy take chance with
Ancient Nazarite weh make the Red Sea parted
Provide the harvest, in drought and shortage
With Jah by my side I've got all advantage
(Here.. here I come again)
Gong originally, run fi the grand finale
(Have no fear.. for it is only I)
I do it regularly, through every hill and valley
(I'm here to teach you only truth)
It's Mister Warm and Easy
Somebody please believe me
(For the things you do, Jah is watching you)

So buy your tickets to the show, get there early grab a seat
The real Gong is in the house, everything else counterfeit
If I have not been around, it's a part of my mystique
I've been busy so to speak, I've been winning on a streak
I've been feeling like a Wednesday, surrounded by the week
Be strong alone continue, fi di justice where we seek
So doh follow some DJ cah dem swimming up a creek
Dem inna deeper shit when time dem an dem maker meet
And if you buy the bullshit, then don't lose your receipt
Them bound fi self destruct, mi ago lowe dem, mek you see it
Dem sow weh dem a reap, dem think say Jah no seet
When the stage show full a demon and the club dem full a freak
And the dancehall full a pagans and dance like dem a Greek
Dem renk and dem a reek, dem pop down one a week
Dem always overdweet, but turn the other cheek
The earth is for the meek, huh
(Here.. here I come again)
Gong originally, run fi the grand finale
(Have no fear.. for it is only I)
I do it regularly, through every hill and valley
(I'm here to teach you only truth)
It's Mister Warm and Easy
Somebody please believe me
(For the things you do, Jah is watching you)

Me do a thousand video shooting, ten thousand chariot
Hundred thousand photo shoot and million radio drop
Mi deejay til' me hoarse a welcome people to the rock
You think a silver spoon or like it drop inna mi lap
Me sign a billion autograph, up to now the tour no stop
Trade privacy for privilege, it balance when it swap
Tony Rebel say a reggae put Jamaica 'pon the map
Who am I to disagree when I've been reaping up the crop
My first release was '93, when dem a feed pon Similac
First Grammy at 23, tell me which one a dem do that
Another tour at 27, add it up and do the maths
The weight weh dem a carry that no heavy like me locks
I'm a veteran, the youngest to be exact
Ghetto people love me bad, I'm guessing opposites attract
Uptown me born and grow, Stony Hill to mark the spot
Big Gong to the Zilla and the return of the mac7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Dread shine your light
So a child may follow
Many have been lost along the way
Until tonight
Turns into tomorrow
Teach them to be careful while at play
There’s nothing wrong with having fun
Don’t let the system tame you
It’s just a part of being young
And even though they’re quick to blame you
Picking on you like a plum
Because your dream became true
Now look what they’ve become
In open sight and plain view
They’ve already had a run
So meanwhile they try to change you
It’s not over till it’s done
So please remain the same you

Hey young world (hey young world)
Hey young world (hey young world)
Hey young world
The world is yours
Hey young world (hey young world)
Hey young world (hey young world)
Hey young world
The world is yours

Dread shine your light
So a child may follow
Many have been lost along the way
Until tonight
Turns into tomorrow
Teach them to be careful while at play
You might not think you know enough
Don’t let that deter you
It’s all apart of growing up
And we’re all young enough to learn to
And don’t you live life in a rush
The past cannot be returned to
And when you feel like giving up
Remember patience is a virtue
When you fall try to get up
Have some guts, I’m trying to urge you
Be proud of owning up
The truth will never hurt you

Hey young world (hey young world)
Hey young world (hey young world)
Hey young world
The world is yours
Hey young world (hey young world)
Hey young world (hey young world)
Hey young world
The world is yours

Dread shine your light
So a child may follow
'Cause many have been lost along the way
Until tonight
Turns into tomorrow
Teach them to be careful while at play
So when you’re rising start, be wise and smart
Try make your mark
Don't you hype and floss, and drive to fast
'Cause life’s too short
Try make good times last 'cause time fly past
And if time is money, that means time cost
But it don’t cost money to joke and laugh
So if you love somebody hurry up and talk

Hey young world (hey young world)
Hey young world (hey young world)
Hey young world
The world is yours3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh Autumn seems to never end
Leaves are always brown
Summer seems to never tend
To ever come around
Springtimes are for beginnings
When true love is found
Winters are for finishings
True love stands it’s grounds
Now I hear no happy songs
Birds have all gone south
Bright Green pasture drying up
And plenty turn to drought

Life is full of ups and downs
The carousels of love
Good times, bad times, smiles, and frowns
Don’t give up on me
Don't give up on me

Time flies by while having fun
It’s all gone in a wink
And now the days feel more like months
Don’t know what to think
Life is full of ups and downs
The carousels of love
Good times, bad times, smiles, and frowns
Don’t give up on me
Don't give up on me

Time flies by while having fun
It’s all gone in a wink
Now the days feel more like months
Who knows what to think?

Life is full of ups and downs
The carousel of love
Good times, bad times, smiles, and frowns
Darling, don’t give up on me
Up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Mr. President, Distinguished delegates...

''The security of the world
Those who disturb (terrorise) the peace at this time
We are going to describe them now''
Since the beginning of modern civilization
Generations have witnessed and inherited the only conflicts of world wars
But behold the marriage supper of the lamb and the bridegroom onto his bride
Then shall the earth's children know the true expression of ONE LOVE
Then mother earth shall honeymoon in peace
Forever eliminating the aspirations, lust and anguish of wars and rumors of wars...
SELAH!

See it deh know the innocent going up in vapors
And propaganda spreading inna the sunday papers
Not even superman coulda save you with him cape cause
Red-a Judgement a blaze, blaze ya
And Babylon a gamble the youth dem life like racehorse
And gi dem a uniform and a shave dem head with razors
And now the clock a strike war, don't be amazed cause
Dem inna dem churches tryin to save... saviours
Can we do it? We can do it, we shall do it!

Boom!
Tell dem fi nuh draw mi out when the world government inna falling out
Only few men survive crawling out
Run left him colleagues dem sprawling out
NEARLY DEAD!
Medic haffi haul him out
And gi him two tranquilizer fi stall him out
DEH PON BASE!
Can't get no calling out when him hear from the shout last week
Him mistress find a new shoes
Wife can't get no news and lately she starting to doubt
She still searching!
And the youth dem bawling out
Working hard not to let it all come out
Well it's not safe to go walk about
A slaughterhouse from Baghdad to Waterhouse
She start to arouse sometime she want a spouse
She start go out, start beat a darker stout
GUNS COME OUT!
Working people funds run out
Keep a show last week and no one come out
BOMBS COME OUT!
Mi gas tank just run out
BOMBOCLAAT!
The scotch tape just run out
WEED RUN OUT!
Yuh senses must dumb out, Mi have a pound round a back deh a gwan sun out
NAH COME OUT!
Till the chalice bun out
NAH COME OUT!
Till the malice bun out, A WAR!
Zimbabwe to Berlin Wall
Blazin' like a burnin' ball, loose ball...dat no work in war
Sleepin dat no work in war
Can't wear jheri curl in war
No diamond and pearl in war
Can't drink weh a serve in bar cah
Gas wi fuck up yuh nerves in war
Shot wi blood up yuh shirt in war
Can't go lift up no skirt in war
Now disease and germs in war
Can't go release your sperms in war
Stamina must preserve in war
Fire constantly burn in war
RED...IT RED...IT RED...IT RED...IT RED!

If you cannot do it, if you are not prepared to do it...then you will die
You race of cowards, you race of imbeciles, you race of good for nothings!
If you cannot do what other men have done
What other nations have done, what other races have done
Then you yourself shall die!

See it deh know the innocent going up in vapors
And propaganda spreading inna the sunday papers
Not even superman coulda save you with him cape cause
Red-a Judgement a blaze, blaze ya
And Babylon a gamble the youth dem life like racehorse
And gi dem a uniform and a shave dem head with razors
And now the clock a strike war, don't be amazed cause
Dem inna dem churches tryin to save... saviours
SEE IT DEH NOW...Hey!
Now wi fore parents sacrifice enough
Dem blood sweat and tears run like syrup
Any day a revolution might erupt, and the skies over Kingston lighting up
For the new generation rising up, of youths now a days weh dem sighting up
And through reasoning dem biding up
Searching for the sign and the sign is us
Searching for the truth all you find is us
Searching for the troops still behind is us
The almighty we recruit and we come from the root
We build like roach killing boot
Weh just can't done, Rastafari design me tuff
If a the fight for freedom sign me up
Cause you Tell-Lie-Vision can't blind me up
Soldiers and police dem wising up, realizing they're no more right than us
Realizing there's no use fighting us
Realizing their opening their eyes to see the same demoralizing life as us
So we nah tek talk nor smiling up
Cause the word temper tantrum boiling up
And who calling the shots and nah bust none
Controlling the mind of the young, bring down...
Bear famine, no rain nah fall from London to Dadeland mall
All the son of the virgin bawl
Institute of the church in war
Preaching and researching war
Practice and rehearsing war
Teaching and dem learning war
Instigating and urging war
Always keep alert in war
Cause man will jump out a swerving car
Now bees and birds in war
And the freaks and nerds in war
And the straight and curves in war
Forward and reverse in war

Here we are, here we are, yeah
This one right here is for the people
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkonte
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kiye
Ni kera mogo
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkonte
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kagni (Hey, yo, D, let's go all the way in on this one)
Ni kera mogo
Some of the smartest dummies can't read the language of Egyptian mummies
Plant a flag on the moon and can't find food for the starving tummies
Pay no mind to the youths 'cause it's not like the future depends on it
But save the animals in the zoo 'cause the chimpanzee them make big money
This is how the media pillages, on TV the picture is savages in villages
And the scientist still can't explain the pyramids
Evangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids
Stereotyping the image of the images and this is what the image is
You buy khaki pants and all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones
And thief out gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones
Some of the worst paparazzi's I've ever seen and I ever known
Put the worst on display so the world can see and that's all they will ever show
So the ones in the West will never move east and feel they could be at home
Get tricked by the Beast but where them gon' flee when the monster is fully grown?
Solomonic linage where them can't defeat and them could never clone
My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever own, Lord
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkonte (yeah, that's patience, it's what the old folks told me)
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kiye (can you get with that?)
Ni kera mogo
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkonte (discoverin' the world before this world, a world buried in time)
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kagni (uncovered with rhymes, it gets no realer)
Ni kera mogo
We born not knowing, are we born knowing all?
We growing wiser, are we just growing tall?
Can you read thoughts? Can you read palms?
Can you predict the future? Can you see storms coming?
The Earth was flat, if you went too far, you would fall off
Now the Earth is round, if the shape change again, everybody would start laugh
The average man can't prove of most of the things that he chooses to speak of
And still won't research and find out the root of the truth that you seek of
Scholars teach in universities and claim that they're smart and cunning
Tell them find a cure when we sneeze and that's when their nose start running
And the rich get stitched up when them get cut
Wanna heal them broken bones in the bush with the wet mud
Can you read signs? Can you read stars?
Can you make peace? Can you fight war?
Can you milk cows even though you drive cars?
Can you survive against all odds now?
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkonte (it's crazy)
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kiye (when you feed people the truth, you don't know how they gon' react)
Ni kera mogo
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkonte (you scared of wrong-doers, people that's just ignorant)
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kagni (and scared of the truth, we patient for now)
Ni kera mogo
Who wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an, and was it a lightning storm
That gave birth to the Earth and then dinosaurs were born?
Who made up words? Who made up numbers, and what kind of spell is mankind under?
Everything on the planet we preserve and can it, microwaved it, and try it
No matter what we'll survive it
What's hu-? What's -man? What's human?
Anything along the land we consumin', eatin', deletin', ruin
Tryin' to get paper, gotta have land, gotta have acres
So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson, watch niggas play the game like the Lakers
In a world full of fifty-two fakers, Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers
You superstitious, throw salt over your shoulders, make a wish for the day 'cause
Like somebody got a doll of me, stickin' needles in my arteries, but I can't feel it
Sometimes it's like, "pardon me, but I got a real big spirit"
I'm fearless, I'm fearless, don't you try and grab hold of my soul
It's like a military soldier since seven years old
I held real dead bodies in my arms, felt they body turn cold, oh
Why we born in the first place ff this is how we gotta go? Damn
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkonte (yeah)
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kiye (yeah, yeah, what)
Ni kera mogo
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkonte (this goes to all the wisdom and knowledge seekers of the world)
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kagni (Sabali, patience, yeah)

There's a lot of silly young girls wanna show off
And you're wishin' one day they will grow up
But it's alright, it's alright
They only hear of the things that you know of
And they're wishing one day you will soar
But it's alright, it's alright
So let's have a talk
Like grownups do
Let's do the things, that grown folks do
Me, you
Grown folks slackness
Big woman hotness
Watch it mek me knock this
Experienced fatness
Love it how mi lock this
Gong to the Zilla
I'm a monsta like a Loch Ness
Look how long my locs is
All bills paid, all bets made
House well clean, all bugs sprayed
Vacation tripping, she ain't tripping
Island skipping, fine wine sipping
Gourmet cooking, no Facebooking
Nothing to see 'cause she ain't looking
Tag team masseuses, D Brown's music
Natural juices, so therapeutic
Lips on my earlobe, softer than a q-tip
Getting kinda stony, actin' kinda stupid
Pretendin' we're in highschool, kissing at the movies
So do your grown an' sexy, baby 'cause you're awesome
See some likkle young girls, don' beg you no pardon
Teach 'em how to walk it, welcome dem to stardom
There's a lot of silly young girls wanna show off
And you're wishin' one day they will grow up
But it's alright, it's alright
They only hear of the things that you know of
And they're wishing one day you will soar
But it's alright, it's alright
So let's have a talk
Like grownups do
Let's do the things that grown folks do
Me, you
Early mornin' wake-up, bringin' me the papers
Continental breakfast, smoked salmon an' capers
The eggs are over easy, you're puttin' on your makeup
We do some exercises, strolling through the acres
A mansion out in Gables, cottage in the Naples
Fingles out in Bordeaux, horses in the stables
Baby we're connected, like tv is to cable
Like paper is to staple, like syrup is to maple
If Madonna's like a virgin, age is just a number
So tired of searching, gimme weh me come fah
She feelin' kinda naughty, I'm feelin' kinda rumpish
She is my accomplice, we're gettin' things accomplished
Call ya by your last name, tell ya that you're gorgeous
When I get around you I'm nervous till I'm nauseous
Tell me what's the holdup, baby 'cause I'm anxious
Both of us are grownups, drop your drawers to ankles
There's a lot of silly young girls wanna show off
And you're wishin' one day they will grow up
But it's alright, it's alright
They only hear of the things that you know of
And they're wishing one day you will soar
But it's alright, it's alright
So let's have a talk
