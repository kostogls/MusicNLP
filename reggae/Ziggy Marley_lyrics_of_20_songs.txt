Every day when you're walking down the street
And everybody that you meet
Has an original point of view

And I say hey! (Hey!)
What a wonderful kind of day
If you can learn to work and play
And get along with each other, hey

You got to listen to your heart
Listen to the beat, listen to the rhythm
The rhythm of the street
Open up your eyes, open up your ears
Get together and make things better
By working together

It's a simple message
And it comes from the heart
Oh, believe in yourself (Believe in yourself)
For that's the place to start (Place to start)

And I say hey! (Hey!)
What a wonderful kind of day
If we can learn to work and play
And get along with each other, hey

Open up your eyes, open up your ears
Get together and make things better

Oh, believe in yourself (Believe in yourself)

Life has come a long way since yesterday (I say)
And it's not the same old thing over again (I say)
Just do what you feel and don't you fool yourself (I say)
'Cause I can't make you happy unless I am (I say, I say)

I've got to be true to myself, I've got to be true to myself
I've got to be true to myself, I've got to be true to myself

Day in day out, I've asked many questions (I say)
Only to find the truth it never changes (I say)
If you don't deal with it, it keeps killing you a little by little (I say)
Call me selfish if you will, my life I alone I can live (I say, I say)

I've got to be true to myself, I've got to be true to myself
(In a way now)
I've got to be true to myself, I've got to be true to myself

I don't care if it hurts, I'm tired of lies and all these games
I've reached a point in life, hey, no longer can I be this way
Don't come crying to me, I too have shed my share of tears
I'm moving on, yes I'm grooving on
Hey, well I'm finally free
I've got to be true to myself, I've got to be true to myself
(In a way oh)
I've got to be true to myself, I've got to be true to myself
(Come on now)
I've got to be true, I've got to be true
I've got to be true to myself (In a way oh)
I've got to be true, I've got to be true
I've got to be true to myself1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

On the beach in Hawaii
I wish you were here with me
Walking on the beach in Hawaii
Playing on the golden sand
Looking at the ocean now I understand
Love is like the open sea
And I wish you were here with me
On the beach in Hawaii
Since you've been gone away
I think about you everyday
Don't you know I miss you much
And you know I need your touch
I'm on a rocky cliff
Oh I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
On the beach in Hawaii
I wish you were here with me
A little pakalolo
And I say mahalo
Ujjayi breathing
To get a real feeling
Yogi gonna let you know
That I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
On the beach in Hawaii
I wish you were here with me
In Hawaii
I wish you were here with me
On the beach in Hawaii
Oh I wish you were here with me

Everybody's worried about time
But I just keep that shit off my mind
People living on twenty four hour clocks
But we're on a ride that never stops
Hey Mister Bee, the world change but you remain the same
And I wonder how you'll survive with the environment going down the drain
Hey Miss Dragonfly, I see you look at me with your beautiful eyes
You must be wondering what type of creature am I
A dog looked at me and said Ziggy why can't we trust man
Puss and me get together why can't you all just understand
An old tree stood there silently listening to every word we said
As a tear fell he cried what type of creature is man
I said hey Mister Tree, the world change but you remain the same
And I wonder how you survive with the environment going down the drain
Hey Miss butterfly, I see you look at me with your beautiful eyes
You must be wondering what kind of creature am I
You must be wondering what kind of creature am I

We are the people, we're not corporations
We are the people, we're not labels for your stock
We are the people, we're not crayons in a box
We are the people, we're not donkeys and elephants

Taking over from machines who you think you can trust
For the ballads that we play are like the bullets in a gun
Wake up and open your heart, now, don't be deceived
Oh, when you see yourself for who you are, you'll be truly free

We are the people, listen to our song
We are the people, together we are strong
We are the people, stronger than one race
We are the people, stronger the one fate

To divide us, to define us, categorize us and neutralize us
Like robots living in a dream doing what they think they must
Scenes in black and white, painted with the brush

So, you think they care, it's a paper town
With paper politicians, oh yes
Hey, you think you're safe in your hiding place
Way up on the cloud
Spread it all around the world
Our voices must be heard
With dignity and might
Oh what a beautiful sight

(Verse 1)
I found a place where the weekend's long
Don't check no luggage just carry on
Why should you laugh instead of cry
Why should you live instead of die
I'll be your reason
It's okay go on and give me a try
Walk with your head way up above the sky
I'll be your reason yeah
Don't be afraid for what is to come
It's been too long since that bell was rung
Ooh yeah I'll be the reason
Why you should even have a little faith
Why you should grow and cultivate
I'll be your reason yeah
(Chorus)
I found a place where the weekend's long (found a place)
Don't check no luggage just carry on (all night long)
Leave the sorrows indoctrinated
Cause now you've been emancipated

Say come on it couldn't be a sin
Maybe your god could see the heart of things
And I'll be your reason
Sometimes you need some time to play
You think you lost but you just found your way
Ooh yeah I'll be your reason
Come on now

I found a place where the weekend's long (found a place)
Don't check no luggage just carry on (all night long)

Hey... I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
Mommy loves to work and daddy loves to play
Sometimes daddy got to go far away
I'm too young to go quiet in the night
Try to put me to sleep I'm gonna give it a fight
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
Wake you up at 5 am
Before the sunrise I'll be your friend
And you know I don't like for you to take too long
Just come running when you hear this song

Well now....I'm gonna miss you now Mr. Far Away
Paint a picture of you and send it off today
And when you come home you can bring it back to me
Color in the lines, define this whole world for me

Practice makes perfect and that I agree
So don't be surprised that I want to be free
I know what I know and that's all that I know
But I been told you reap what you sow
Mama's telling me what to eat today
But I don't feel like I'm gonna go that way
What I need is something sweet and nice
What I need is a treat alright
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
Set the children free. Set the children free
Set the children free
Free up their hearts, free up their minds
Set the children free
Free up their dreams and their imagination
Set the children free

There are times we choose to wear our shoes
Feet need to be protected
But when it's safe to go without, here's something unexpected
Those little piggies on your feet, they love to wiggle free, exploring nature, skin to earth, footloose and fancy wee-wee-wee-wee
All the way home
Set your piggies free
Set your piggies free
It's time to lose those socks and shoes and set your piggies free
Set your piggies free, exploring naturally
The greatest way to do it is to really get into it and set your piggies free
Take off your shoes
Feel the morning dew
Let the cool breeze blow in between each toe
Make a barefoot stand in the soft, warm sand
And don't forget to let your feet get wet
Watch out, little piggies
That water's cold
So set your piggies free
Set your piggies free
It's time to lose those socks and shoes and set your piggies free
Set your piggies free, exploring naturally
The greatest way to do it is to really get into it and set your piggies free
At times you're going to need a shoe
Your foot's just got to wear it
But when there's nature to explore, then you got to grin and "bare" it
Not that kind of bear feet
I'm talking bare feet


Set your piggies
I got to set my piggies
You got to do it
You know you got to do it
Set your piggies freeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

A fire burns for freedom, the smell of dissent is high
I'm standing for the truth, too long it's been denied
The tide of change is rising, let hope be realized
Unchain these wings, let angels fly

I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free
I see marijuana trees blowing in the breeze
I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free, wild and free

A crime against nations, a war is waged
There's a message in the wind, for every race
Peace and love we sow, so let us grow
It's good for the body, it's good for the soul

I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free
I see marijuana trees blowing in the breeze
I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free, wild and free

Sold us the kiss of death, denied us the tree of life
This damn hypocrisy, cost so many lives
Corporation greed, can't own this seed
Small farmers will survive by planting weed
I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free
I see marijuana trees blowing in the breeze
I see hemp fields forever, growing wild and free, wild and free

A crucified savior, to save your face
Demonizing nature our saving grace
We got to put to good use, what the lord has gave
Fruits of the tree, the herbs of the field

Needs of the many, the wants of the few

Changes, changes, yeah

I just can't help the way that I feel
We all want our dreams to be real
Yet circumstances that I just can't understand
Why does money got to make the man?
Everyone has an ego to feed
And every want is filled with greed
So here's one thing that I've got to say
Changes, changes, yeah, yeah
For ordinary people now
Yeah, changes, changes
For ordinary people now, y'all

Change for the better and not for the worse
Let's stand together and break our curses
We look off in the distance chasing dreams
But the things that I see with my eye's obscene
Let's plant a new tree, make a change
Need it for you and me, brighter days
Will come and you'll see, make the change
Necessary for ordinary people

There's so much beauty in every breath that we take
Oh, tell me, can you relate?
Needs of the many and the wants of the few
You can find religion in the freedom you choose
There's so much hurt all over the place
And I can tell by the look on your face
And there's one thing that we've got to say

Changes, changes
(Danny man say, brighten up your day and never feel no weight)
For ordinary people now
(Hear what we say, hear what we say)
Changes, changes
(Brighten up your day and don't feel no weight)
For ordinary people now
(Do you hear what we say? Do you hear what we say?)
Changes, changes
(Brighten up your day and don't feel no weight)
For ordinary people now
(Can you hear what we say? Hear what we say)
Changes, changes
(Brighten up your day, ain't gonna feel no pain)
For ordinary people nowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

One Love!
One Heart!
Let’s get together and feel all right
Hear the children cryin’
(One Love! );
Hear the children cryin’
(One Heart! )
Sayin’: give thanks and praise
To the Lord and I will feel all right;
Sayin’: let’s get together
And feel all right
Wo wo-wo wo-wo!
Let them all pass all their dirty
Remarks (One Love! );
There is one question
I’d really love to ask (One Heart! ):
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner
Who has hurt all mankind just
To save his own beliefs?
One Love! What about the one heart?
One Heart!
What about?
Let’s get together and feel all right
As it was in the beginning
(One Love! );
So shall it be in the end
(One Heart! )
All right!
Give thanks and praise to the Lord
And I will feel all right;
Let’s get together
And feel all right
One more thing!
Let’s get together to fight
This Holy Armagiddyon (One Love! )
So when the Man comes there will be no
No doom (One Song! )
Have pity on those whose
Chances grows t’inner;
There ain’t no hiding place
From the Father of Creation
Sayin’: One Love!
What about the One Heart?
(One Heart! )
What about the?
Let’s get together and feel all right
I’m pleadin’ to mankind!
(One Love! );
Oh, Lord!
(One Heart)
Wo-ooh!
Give thanks and praise to the Lord
And I will feel all right;
Let’s get together and feel all right
Give thanks and praise to the Lord
And I will feel all right;
Let’s get together and feel all rightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
