No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry

'Cause, 'cause, 'cause I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites, yeah
Mingle with the good people we meet, yeah
Good friends we have had, oh good friends we've lost along the way, yeah
In this bright future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say, yeah

No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, eh, yeah
Little darling don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

Eh, Said, said, said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown, yeah
And then Georgie would make the fire light, I say
A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge, I say
Of which I'll share with you, yeah
My feet is my only carriage
And so I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
So No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, I say
Oh little, oh little darling, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry, eh

No woman, no woman, no woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
One more time I've got to say
Oh little, little darling, please don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

Old pirates, yes, they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Redemption songs

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Ooh, some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book
Won't you help to sing

"Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright"
Singing, "Don't worry about a thing

Three little birds pitch by my doorstep
Singing sweet songs of melodies pure and true
Saying, "This is my message to you-ou-ou"

Singing, "Don't worry about a thing

Buffalo soldier, dreadlocked rasta
There was a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
I mean it, when I analyse the stench
To me it makes a lot of sense
How the dreadlocked rasta was a Buffalo Soldier

And he was taken from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said it was a Buffalo Soldier, dreadlocked Rasta
Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America

If you know your history
Then you would know where you're coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the 'eck do I think I am

I'm just a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier, in the war for America
Said he, woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!
Woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!

Buffalo Soldier troddin' through the land, wo-ho-ooh!
Said he want to ran and then you want a hand
Troddin' through the land, yea-hea, yea-ea
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier in the war for America
Buffalo Soldier, dreadlocked Rasta
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Driven from the mainland to the heart of the Caribbean
Said he, woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!
Woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!

Trodding through San Juan

Trodding through Jamaica, a Buffalo Soldier
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

Superior and another Inferior

Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race

Many more will have to die
