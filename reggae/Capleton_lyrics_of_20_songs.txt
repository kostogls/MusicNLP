Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly

After me lef' from Jamaica, go a foreign pon tour
Preaching teaching the people fi sure
Answer to Jah when him a knock pon your door
If you ignore you goin' perish fi sure

Come back a Jamaica, everything insecure
Rich a get rich and the poor a get poor
Come back come hear say Pan Head skull bore
Come back come hear say Dirtsman skull bore
Hear say, John Pope Paul all come yah pon tour
DJ down yah a rinse out mi what more
Boogerman a plan all fi march and tour
Tour Kingston, and all go tour Portmore
But me know the whole of dem woulda must dead fi sure
And the DJ dem nah teach people no more
A pure clashing and fighting, dem no unite no more
All a tell the gyal dem fi bruk out like a sore
It seems like the people dem no love God no more
If slackness a the sickness, then culture a the cure
Ice all mi block and all a whole city
After me lef' from Jamaica, foreign pon tour
Preaching, teaching the people fi sure
Answer to Jah when him a knock on the door
If you ignore -

After mi come back a Jamaica, nuff things gone wrong
Cyan know di woman dem different from di man
Whole of dem a dress inna di same pollution
Dawn and John a run competition
Man a take dem money and a go Obeah man
Man a grudgefull and dem no stop envy man
'Bout dem PNP right, and dem Labor wrong
Man a walk pon road and lick down innocent man
Lick down the little pickiney inna di Prom
This is one thing me got fi overstand
Most of the youth dem stop diss Rastaman
Dem get fi know say Rasta a di right tradition
And respect Selassie as the Almighty one
If slackness a the fault, culture a the solution

Lef' from Jamaica, go a foreign pon tour
Preaching teaching the people fi sure
Answer to Jah when him a knock pon your door
If yuh ignore yuh goin' perish fi sure
Come back a Jamaica things nah run right
Man all a fuss and dem no stop from fight
Some long icepick and some ol' rusty knife
Man a walk a road and take an innocent life
'Bout dem PNP wrong, and dem Labor right
Man a walk a road and take an innocent life
Say Selassie I, di whole of dem start to fight
Say Emanuel, and nuff of dem all a fight
Say Marcus Garvey, and nuff of dem a fight
Woman all a shine, and man no stop bite
If slackness a the darkness, then culture a the light
Ice all mi block and all a -

And mi say, after me lef from Jamaica, go a foreign pon tour
Preaching teaching the people fi sure
Answer to Jah when him a knock pon your door
If you ignore you goin' -
Oh!

Answer to Jah when him a knock pon the door
Make sure your hands clean and make sure your heart pure

Things you used to do, you nah go do dem no more
Place you used to go, you nah go go deh no more
Food you used to eat, you nah go eat dem no more

Babylon done again
Fire burn again
Dem can't escape
There's no where to run again
Knowing dis
My daughters and my son again, yea
Let Jah rise
All his enemies scatter
Blessed is the man who walks not in the council of the wicked, nor stands in the ways of sinners, nor shall be seated with scornful
Righteousness exalts a nation; sin is a reproach to any man or any people
Love Jah and livity, man done, uh! boom!
Jah is my lifeline
Protect me from the plagues there in the nighttime
Always make my light shine
Be in the right place at the right time
No go tell me say fi fight crime
Live good and have a nice time
Don't lock off the pipeline
I'm quite fine
Chorus:
I know someday
Jah is gonna set us free
From all this misery
I knew it's true
No matter what they say or do
Jah is gonna see us through
Show love not only sometime
Tell the youths ah overcome time
Make hay while the sun shine
Nuh fall in-a captive and go done time
Tell them a fire burn time
Burn the war and burn the gun crime
Flattering lips a wit dem tongue line
Tell them fi come listen to me punchline

I know someday
Jah is gonna set us free
From all this misery
I knew it's true
No matter what they say or do
Jah is gonna see us through
Said if you feel like nuttin nah gwaan
Still give thanks for the day when you born
Keep the faith and live on
Harm no one and you won't be harmed
Nah bad, nah gun ya hol', no man a go bomb
Nah make no pagan come grease your palm
After the storm it must be a calm

I know someday
Jah is gonna set us free
From all this misery
I knew it's true
No matter what they say or do
Jah is gonna see us through
Jah keep my light shinin (Shining bright)
Seek and search and you will find it (Find your light)
Everything takes timing
Mountain steep; tell dem I'm still climbing
Don't have your sight and act blindin
Babylon time unwindin
Sell you out for nickel and dimin
See dem with plastic smiling

I know someday
Jah is gonna set us free
From all this misery
I knew it's true
No matter what they say or do
Jah is gonna see us throughEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Her bumper cock off and her breast stand up stiff
Me like her figure, she got a nice little hip

Me just step down beside her without any resist
And said, "Hi there, come here, me love your cherry lips"
"A girl like a you, me surely wanna kiss"
Nuh pon her jawbone me fling half dozen kiss
And inna her ears me talk some conscious lyrics
That's why me tell unuh say

Me tell her inna mi kitchen me have  a pot a lick
Hear her nuh, "What's the menu Caple', make me hear it?"
Hear me, rice and peas, and ackee and saltfish
Fruit, and carrot, and pop chow, and lettuce
Hot pepper, sweet pepper, tomato, and Irish
Onion, and scallion, and thyme, and garlic
And pumpkin, cucumber, and turnip
A jug of sour sap juice with nuff ice inna it
That's why me holler out

Everybody-ody-ody-ody

Everybody-ody-ody-ody

As the gyal her mi menu her mouth start to drip
She push out her tongue and then she lick off her lip
And she say, "Lord Massa, me can't wait fi taste it!"
What you're waiting for? Now, let's move to it!
Now on fi mi way fi go prepare mi dish
Nuh down inna mi alper, mi settee, she sit
Now something fi drink fi her body feel fit
Me just inna the buffet, take out the puss stiff
And give the gyal the liquor, tell her fi drink it
And I'm off to the kitchen to prepare the dish
Sametime me hear a voice say, "Capleton, come yah quick!"
Me haffi fling 'way the fork, the spoon, and the dish
And run inna the house without any resist
A that, me sing it out

But big, big surprise weh the gyal see me with

She start to scratch up herself like when cow have ticks
A hawk and spit like when puss have ticks

And make some funny sound like rabbit and cricket

And so great is a man goin to be praised
Selassie I every time
I say Jah shall execute judgment and justice
And none shall escape, what me say
Selassie I leave em terrified, what me say
Boy you better put on the wings of de morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I
Flying on the income must fall to the sea
There is no escape from his Majesty
A long time he a tell you bout the duttie square breed
A long time he a tell you bout the brutality
A long time he a tell you bout the him fantasy
But why yo, boat men shan manakhe
But why yo, a-bout the black he body
But why yo, I vote with equality
But why yo, a-bout Marcus Garvey
We there yo, I feel love his Majesty
Selassie I, soul that kept me
Selassie I, for I the trinity
A ex amount of action been dumped onto me
No stop from wicked them no stop from flee
Ah nowhere to run and there is no void
Boy you better put on the wings of de morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I
Flying on the income must fall to the sea
There is no escape from his Majesty
Here come that rude boy shit, criminology lefit
Legalize dude to get me mega-rich Selassie I
We can all get by if we unify
Gettin chinky eye off the stimuli, blazin the gun
And all that good stuff, six-three walk with a strut
On these New York streets like baby what
Anything can happen, it usually does
I'm from Staten, the Island, peep me on G-Street, Ticallion
Everything is real ain't nuttin fronted
Down a fake rapper haveta bungee
He's in it for the munties, money
But you can't take it witcha when you die, Selassie high
If you put-ta on de wings and tempt to exit
Then no conjure Christ and none gone bullshit
Ay Selai for the righteous but the wicked are to perish
With them burn the gun and them whole poli-tricks
Half the people dem a turn and half the people dem a twist
Now shoot dem, another ear-trick done perish
Get M some 16 and some rusty-matic
After the whole of them from gone then push up them fists
Leave the ship them a strip, you must get punish
Go ahead, speed up your judgment, stand up boy boy
Boy you better put on the wings of de morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I
Flying on the income must fall to the sea
There is no escape from his Majesty
So ahh, and one of these day
When you hear a boy faint then uhh
Where you gonna run too, ohhhh woyyyy
I said they gonna run to the rock
And mountain but they will be no rock, no rock
They're gonna run to the rocks
And mountain but they will be no rock, so what we say
Wu-Tang Clan's in the area, Capleton's in the area
We got Shaolin in the area
Big up yourself black man, my brothers
Hell is the plan for the other, discover, discover, discover, c'mon, c'mon
New lands for you man and your family
Reminisce on back in the days, can it be
It was all so simple then, we all kin
And black-skinned, original Don set the trend
Let's be men, if not for us, then for the babies
The little ones the revolution has now begun
(Put on put on the wings of the morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I)
Now, owwww, everybody
Get in where you fit in
For nine-five, the nine-nickel
Cold as an icicle, Method Man

Dynamic Duo on the trackEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
