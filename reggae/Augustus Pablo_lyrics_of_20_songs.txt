From the east to west
Seek Jah, Rasfari, righteousness
For Jah is liberty, Selah
Java!
(… Java!)
(… Java!)
(… Java!)
Long time, I and I
Suffer in the worst, you know
A no need is, Babylonians to sustain
But I and I have no fear
For Jah, is always near, Selah
(… Java!)
(… Java!)
(… Java!)

(… Java!)
(… Java!)
Seek Jah first, and all things
Shall be added unto the I, you know

Look what-a-happened to the young generation
So much pain-a-happenin jah jah know it's confusion
Said it's time, it's time, it's time, for repopulation
Said it's time, it's time, it's time, to build nation
Well if you're not feeling the voice of the people
You're not dealin with nothing
You got to feel the voice of the people
Before you're dealing with something
Said it's time, it's time, it's time, for repopulation
Said it's time, it's time, it's time, to build nation
Oooh
Well if you're not feeling the voice of the people
You're not dealin with nothing
You got to feel the voice of the people
Before you're dealing with something
Said it's time, it's time, it's time, for repopulation
Said it's time, it's time, it's time, to build nation
Look what-a-happened to the young generation
So much pain-a-happenin jah jah know it's confusion
Said it's time, it's time, it's time, for repopulation
Said it's time, it's time, it's time, to build nationEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
