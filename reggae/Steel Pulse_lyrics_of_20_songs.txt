Walking along just kicking stones
Minding my own business
I come face to face with my foe
Disguised in violence from head to toe
I holler and I bawl (the Ku Klux Klan)
Them no let me go now (the Ku Klux Klan)
To let me go was not dem intention (they say)
One nigga the less
The better the show
Stand strong black skin and take your blow
The Ku Klux Klan
The Ku Klux Klan
Here to stamp out black man
The Ku Klux Klan
To be taught a lesson not to walk alone
I was waiting for the Good Samaritan
But, but, but waiting was hopeless
It was all in vain
The Ku Klux Klan back again
I holler and I bawl (the Ku Klux Klan)
Them no let me go now (the Ku Klux Klan)
(They say)
One nigga the less
The better the show
Stand strong black skin and take your blow
The Ku Klux Klan
The Ku Klux Klan
Rape, lynch, kill and maim
Things can't remain the same you know!
Black man, do unto the Klan
As they would do to you
In this case hate thy neighbour
Those cowards only kill who they fear
That's why they hide behind
The hoods and cloaks they wear
I holler and I bawl (the Ku Klux Klan)
Dem no let me go (the Ku Klux Klan)
Oh no, oh no
The Ku Klux Klan
The Ku Klux Klan
Here to stamp out black man
Rape, lynch, kill and maim
Things can't remain the same you know
No, no, no, no1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Out on the corner
With my roller skates
Having fun with the girls
Says I'm feeling great woo
In the dark of the night
Street lamps glowing
On full blast is my radio
Radio
Up comes this guy in his flashy car
In his mouth stuck a big cigar
Needed my help said he lost his way
I never heard a word he said
To find some street, said he wanted instructions
So I turned down the music
To point out directions, guess what?
Guy jumped on me messed up my clothes
Smashed and grabbed my radio
Calling all detectives
A criminal at large smoking
A big fat cigar in a flashy car
And think him some superstar
CHORUS
Life life without music
I can't go go no
Life without music I can't go
I'm gonna get him
The last thing I do
Must get a beating
Till him red and blue
Didn't take long to catch him
Parked up car and music blasting
On the sidewalk he was dancing
Stealing the show, the people watching
Roller skate gang
Was hot on his tracks
Stick him up mister
Give me back Give me back
Give me back Give me back
My radio
Guy jumped on me messed up my clothes
Saaahed and grabbed my radio
Calling all detectives
A criminal at large smoking
A big fat cigar in a flashy car
And think him some super star
CHORUS
Life life without music
I can't go
Life life without music
I can't go
Life without music
Bimma! murder style
Dem have fe get a beatin'
Say dem have fe get a beatin'
Nothing greater nothing best
Like the music from my wireless
And the only thing that I detest
Is the man who steal my wireless
Him ha fe run like a fugitive
Him ha fe run from detective
Samuel Thomas is the thief name
Lie must a lead life of shame
Some a dem call him Uncle Sam
Some a dem call him Uncle Tom
Uncle Sam and Uncle Tom
Yes they are the same man
S.A.M. means "stealaway music"
T.O.M. means "thiefer of music"
The druna and the bass
Have fe move me waist
The ridim and skank
Me have JAH fe thank
The lyrics and song
Me have fe keep me strong
Samuel Thomas him have fe get vank
Him have fe get a beatin'

Of robots yes yeh
All forms of life
Would eventually stop
But now dem dog gone crazy
Mass producing test tube babies

On a wild goose chase
Laws of nature they just can't face
Ambition is to mash up the place
Who shall save the human race?
Chemicals in the food
To control population
Intentions to build
A plastic nation
Cloning cats to have dogs
Human beings breeding hogs
On the moon in search of aliens
But now dem dog gone crazy
Mass producing test tube babies

This world is an unconscious laboratory
Using my people as guinea pigs

Soon the old will inject
Themselves to keep young
Ain't no telling what they do next
All I know that JAH must vex
0 righteous one keep in check
Thunder will roll and break evil's neck

‘Cause out of Africa
Came the Garden of Eden

Hidden from me I was never told
Ancient prophets black and gold
Like Daniel, King David and Abraham
Israel were all black men
I don't wanna lose you
Japhet tried his best to erase
The godly parts we played
I says he came and took
And never mention in his book... so
CHORUS
A dis ya version
A no King James version
‘Cause out of Africa
Came the Garden of Eden

In Esau's chapter of history
So little mention of you and me
We rulers of kingdoms and dynasties
Explored this Earth for centuries
I don't wanna lose ya
Phoenicians, Egyptians and the Moors
Built civilisation, that's for sure
Creators of the alphabet
While the West illiterate..yeh
CHORUS

A no King James version
‘Cause out of Africa
Came the Garden of Eden

African heritage
I don't wanna lose ya
Oh, no

Said we turned our backs on God
Lost the powers that we had
Now our backs against the wall
Ask ourselves about the fall
Rise rise rise
Hold on to your culture

And the struggle goes on---
Some say the earth
Will keep on turning
Dread times are near
And I'm not joking I a warning
As we continue that same old moaning
The chosen race just keep on begging yeh
And I wanna know who's responsible?
They don't give a damn no
Mother's joy turn to
Pain and hollering
Weeping for their babes and sucklings
Spirits of the innocent wandering
Sufferation everlasting
But I wanna know who's responsible?
They don't give a damn no
Oh Papa dem chest keeps on burning
Fist clench tight a grit dem teeth
And blood is boiling
The price is high yet they keep on paying
The little bundles of love
They are all missing
And I wanna know who's responsible?
They don't give a damn no
Brothers and sisters
This plight we're facing
Get involved problems to solved
Yourselves concerning
Divided we are so
One by one we are falling
The front line of the battle is hottest
Your duties calling
I demand to know who's responsible?
They don't give a damn no
Talking down south Atlanta killings
Talking down south Deptford bombings
Talking down south Azania coming
They'll cut your hearts out
And I'm not joking
Turn no blind eye brothers be willing
Yeh the front line of the battle is hottest
Your duties callingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My people are in a mess
But nobody wants to know
Cos when you're down and out and oppressed
You've got to fight your battles from the
Lowest of the low
So keep your distance and take your stance
Cos this could be your utmost chance
You've had all night and day to
Consider and pray
You've brought fire on my head and
Now you must pay

Babylon makes the rules
Babylon makes the rules
Babylon makes the rules

Where my people suffer...
Take Rastaman culture for instance
Dem think is political joke
But we people know better then that
Cos what keeps us together is
Jah Herb that we smoke
I and I know the truth of it all
Cos we have smashed our heads
'gainst that wall
And now I seh we must create a scene
We must recapture our culture
By any means
CHORUS
Babylon makes the rules
Babylon makes the rules
Babylon makes the rules
Babylon makes the rules
Where my people suffer ...
Count the times we've been let down
And left us in despair
And woe betide that evil man
Who giveth not a care
You've gotta check yourself just
One more time
Reassure your mind -
Cos those who are chosen
By the father's hand
Must not get left behind
Rasta seh - guidance

Babylon makes the rules but
Jah love will carry I homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Rastafari sins forgiven
Woy! Desperation has return...
One has returned without one's soul
And has squandered all his possessions
Let us cleanse your body now
From your service to the swine, because
You've been dead and now to anoint your head
With wisdom, knowledge and overstanding
A lesson has been taught unto you my friend
Time for a feast and rejoicing

So...
Give I back I witch doctor
Give I back I Black Ruler
Me no want no dictator
Me no want no tyrant on yah
Dutallee!
Dutallee!
Dutallee!

The Earth is the Lord's
And the fullness thereof now
Gave man his love and they
Reward him with violence
And in these last days
Lend ears to what I say
Man in his ignorant state
Has signed and sealed his own fate
Doctrines of the fallen angels
To quench eternal flames of hell
Doctrines of the fallen angels
To quench eternal flames of hell
Earth crisis Earth crisis
All this suffering
Earth crisis Earth crisis
Misguided people
They don't seem to care
They carry the symbol
Of the eagle and the bear
Across the globe
Far east to far west
High tax and cutbacks for military defence
Doctrines of the fallen angels
To quench eternal flames of hell
Doctrines of the fallen angels
To quench eternal flames of hell
Earth crisis Earth crisis
All this suffering
Earth crisis Earth crisis
Super powers have a plan
Undermining Third World man
Suck their lands of minerals
Creating famine and pestilence
You hear what I say hear what I say
The Earth is the Lord's
And the fullness thereof now
Gave man his love and they
Reward him with violence
And in these last days
Lend ears to what I say
Man in his ignorant state
Has signed and sealed his own fate in this
Earth crisis
In a Earth, in a Earth, in a dis ya time yah
Earth crisis, Earth crisis
You life in there hands just waiting to explode
Earth crisis
A touch of a button fingertip control
Earth crisis
It hardly surprising
Earth crisis
JAH kingdom rising
Earth crisis
All this suffering1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Woooh! Man no sober
The drunkard he staggers around
The alleys of cities and towns
His sorrows he tries to drown
Solution to his problems
Can never be found
Booze is what he choose
Like a gipsy he's tipsy
He drinks too much whiskey
Like a gipsy he's tipsy
He drinks too much
A Mr Winehead stagger deh
Booze is what he choose
Watch him how topples over
CHORUS
------
Man no sober
In and out of discotheques
In and out of wine bars
Burnt out shell looks a wreck
Got to help him somehow oh
Greets bartenders drink firewater
Dance bossanova he topples over
CHORUS
------
Man no sober
With a bottle in his hand
Hangover
(Repeat)
In and out of discotheques
In and out of wine bars
CHORUS
------
Man no sober
From dust till dawn he
He staggers around
From dust till dawn
He drinks it all day long
Yow yow watch him how he topples overEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
