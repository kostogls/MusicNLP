Many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering, I am lost
As I travel along White Cliffs of Dover

Many rivers to cross
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years
And I merely survive because of my pride

Oh, that loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left and she didn't say why
Well I guess I'll have to try

Many rivers to cross
But just where to begin? I'm playing for time
There'll be times I find myself
Thinking of committing some dreadful crime

Yes, I've got many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering, I am lost
As I travel along the White Cliffs of Dover...4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well the years have come and the years have gone
Still the son of man keeps a trotting on
Journey, Journey on
Yet from innocence to experience
From dependence to independence
Journey, Journey on
Well now I have love and I have been loved
I have judged and I have been judged
Journey, Journey on
So where there come a storm there's a victory
Cause I live all and all lives in me
Journey, Journey on

Journey, Oh Journey
And I never get, never get weary yet
Journey, Oh Journey
Still I never get, never get weary yet
I was captured on the banks of the river Nile
Carried far beyond the seven seas
Journey, Journey on
So I left my home in the morning
I wanna go home in the evening
Journey, Journey on

Like the sun and sea life is flowing free
I've got to be free 1983
Journey, Journey on
So from the lessons learned and the tables turned
The victories earned and my heart still yearns
Journey, Journey on

Hey, Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Yesterday, I got a letter from my friend fighting in Vietnam
And this is what he had to say
"Tell all my friends that I'll be coming home soon
My time'll be up sometime in June
Don't forget", he said, "To tell my sweet Mary
Her golden lips are sweet as cherry"
And it came from Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
It was just the next day, his mother got a telegram
It was addressed from Vietnam
Now mistress Brown, she lives in the USA
And this is what she wrote and said
"Don't be alarmed", she told me the telegram said
"But mistress Brown, your son is dead"
And it came from Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, hey, Vietnam
Somebody please stop that war now

Well, they tell me of a pie up in the sky
Waiting for me when I die
But between the day you're born and when you die
They never seem to hear even your cry

So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine

And then the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all
Ooh, the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all

Well, the oppressors are trying to keep me down
Trying to drive me underground
And they think that they have got the battle won
I say forgive them Lord, they know not what they've done

Cause, as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all
Ooh, the harder they come
Harder they fall, one and all


And I keep on fighting for the things I want
Though I know that when you're dead you can't
But I'd rather be a free man in my grave
Than living as a puppet or a slave

So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share right now, what's mine

And then the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all
Ooh, the harder they come
Harder they fall, one and all
Hey, the harder they come
Harder they fall, one and all
What I say now
What I say now

You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try, try and try, try and try
You'll succeed at last

Persecution you must fear
Win or lose you got to get your share
You've got your mind set on a dream
You can get it though hard it may seem now

You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try, try and try, try and try
You'll succeed at last

Rome was not built in a day
Opposition will come your way
But the hotter the battle you see
Is the sweeter the victory now
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try, try and try, try and try
You'll succeed at last

When I was a cool young one
(When he was a cool young one)
I worked in the colony
Paying my dues
Accepting without question the prevailing views
That a young man's life was one long grind
Diggin' holes, standin' guard, 'til it crossed my mind
I was wrong
All along
All that I needed
Was to have heeded

Hakuna Matata
What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata
Ain't no passing craze
It means no worries
For the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata
When I was a shallow youth
(When he was a shallow youth)
Cool calm reflection
I was never that good
I was a pawn in the game
I saw no trees for the wood
My future stretched behind me
I was over the hill
I put my best foot forward
But the other stood still
Take my word
I have heard
All that I needed
Was to have heeded

Where he sat down
And there he wept
When he remembered Zion
Cause the wicked carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
How can we sing King Alpha's song
In a strange land?

And the meditation of our heart
Be acceptable in Thy sight

Wonderful world, beautiful people
You and your girl, things could be pretty
But underneath this there is a secret
That nobody can reveal
Take a look at the world
And the state that it's in today
I am sure you'll agree
We all could make it a better way
With our love, put together
Everybody learn to love each other
Instead of fussing and fighting
Cheating, backbiting
Scandalizing and hating
Baby we could have a
Wonderful world, beautiful people

This is our world, can't you see?
Everybody wants to live and be free
Instead of fussing and fighting

Hey you, I'm up from the bayou
Where wildlife runs free
You could say that I'm country
But let me tell you what I see
Your world is plastic
Can see through to the other side
Your cities are made of wood
Antiques are what you've got inside
Houses are paper but folks don't hear a word you say
Friendship's like acid
It burns, burns, burns as it slides away
So you see, my patience is growin' thin
With this synthetic world we're livin' in
The word imitation is goin' cross the nation
What's real has become a freak
Someone's tryin' to make me weak
Strange initials to keep me blind
Psychedelic music to blow my mind
So you see, my patience is growin' thin
With this synthetic world we're livin' in
Spray to clear the air and its filled with spray
Makin' people die every day
Now I find I'm out of place
If I only have one face
All my friends have more than two
No longer must you be you
They found out how to transplant
Maybe it has, replaced can
So you see, my patience is growin' thin
With this synthetic world we're livin' in
Na na na nee na na na na..EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There's a day of feasting and a day of famine
Day of sadness and a day of joy
You could see in the day of feasting
Life isn't just a little play-like toy
So the day arrived when you least expected
Cos you always thought you were well protected
Now you feel like a fish out of water
So now you're wondering what's the matter
Oh remember you said it wouldn't happen to you
Now you're thinking how to start a new
A drowning man will catch at a straw
You were warned but you wouldn't take heed
Everything in creation must obey a law
Its true in words as it is in deed
You were so puffed up in your pomps and pride
You're exposed you got none to hide
Yes, you used to look down on the folks beside you
Never they think you would have come down too
Remember they said you got to reap what you sow
Simple truth everybody know

So rock on
And jam on
We're rockin'
We're jammin'
For all the lonely, lonely people
For all the lonely, lonely hearts
For all the people who needs people
There is a chance to make a new start
We got sunshine in the music
Saw the power in the song
We got sunshine in the music
Music keeps me full of love
We got sunshine in the music (We got sunshine)
There is light in every month of May (We got sunshine)
We got sunshine in the music (We got sunshine)
Music brightens up a cloudy day
So rock on, huh
And jam on
We're rockin'
We're jammin', huh
We ain't got no cold ambition
We are not a politician
We ain't got no nuclear weapon
Just the soul and power in the song
We got sunshine in the music (We got sunshine)
There is light in every month of May (We got sunshine)
We got sunshine in the music (We got sunshine)
Music keeps me full of love
So rock on, huh
And jam on, huh
We're rockin', huh
We're jammin', huh
We got sunshine in the music
We got sunshine in the song
We got sunshine in the music
We got sunshine in the song
We got sunshine in the music
We got sunshine in the song
We got sunshine in Jamaica
