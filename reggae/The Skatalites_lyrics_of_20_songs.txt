Ska, ska, ska, guess got them all pretty bad

Sweet dreams when the night time come

So we're gonna ska, ska, ska, ska till we can't

We've gotta ska, ska, ska, roll me around like a lady
And there ska is the father of rock-steady
Grandfather of reggae music
Which come first the chicken or the egg
Back to the original family
Ska, ska, ska, ska till you can't ska no more
Baby, pretty lady

Time to have some fun, after a hard day's work is done
Time to have some fun, after a hard day's work is done

In the winter of nineteen sixty-four came this movie to Jamaica
The Skatalites took the music from the movie, put it to the ska
And came up with this sound, it's call:
"The Guns of Navarone"

Everybody knows I'm a rude boy
Walking the streets of dreams
Everybody knows I'm a rude boy
Walking the streets of dreams
I'm just an ordinary man
With ordinary plans
I'm just an ordinary man
With ordinary plans
I had a dream last night
That I was a rich man
But when I woke up this morning
I found out I was a poor man
I dreamt I was the president
Living in a tent
But when I woke up this morning
I was thrown out for not paying the rent
No mama, no papa, and I live in the ghetto
I'm just a child from a broken homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm in the mood for ska
Simply because you're near me
Funny but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for ska
Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for ska
Why stop to think that whether
Each little dream I pray
We'll put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud above
If it should rain well let it
Over tonight forget it
We're in the mood for ska
Why stop to think that whether
Each little dream I pray
We'll put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraidEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Here we are face to face
And greeting on and all
Here we stand freedom sounds
A echo for so long
Forget your troubles
Forget your worries
Come and jump and dance
And make merriment
Irie vibrations groovy so groovy
Come and jump and dance
And make merriment
Let's be like one big happy family
Sharing the joy that
Togetherness will bring
Forget your problems
Forget for a moment
Come and jump and dance
And make merriment
Feel the Spirit

When I fall in love
It will be forever
Cause I`ll never ever
Fall in love again
When I fall in love
There will be no other
Only you and me
In soul wide world
If I`ll should fall
In love again
To me could
Be a pleasure
If it don`t take
All my leisures away
When I fall in love
There will be no other
Cause I`ll never ever
Fall in love again
If I`ll should fall
In love again
To me it would
Be a pleasure
If it don`t take
All my leisures away
When I fall in love
There will be no other
Only you and me
In the soul wide world
If I`ll should fall
In love again
To me it would
Be a pleasure
If it don`t take
All my leisures away
When I fall in love
It will be forever
Cause I`ll never ever
Fall in love again
When I fall in love
There will be no other
Only you and me
In the soul wild worldEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I don't know if it's black
I don't if it's white
I don't know if it's girl
I don't know if it's boy
Split personality

Is insecurity
Split personality
It don't matter what the people say
Life was meant to be this way
It don't matter what the world say
People got to be this wayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Goodbye
No use leading with our chins
This is where our story ends
Never lovers, ever friends
Goodbye
Let our hearts call it a day
But before you walk away
I sincerely want to say

I wish you bluebirds, in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss, but more than this
I wish you love
And in July a lemonade to cool you in some leafy glade
I wish you health, and more than wealth
I wish you love
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So with my best, my very best
I set you free
I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all, when snowflakes fall
I wish you love
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So with my best, my very best
I set you free
I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all, when snowflakes fall
I wish you love
I wish you love
I wish you love
I wish you love
I wish you love
I wish you loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Feel it in the one drop;
And we'll still find time to rap;
We're makin' the one stop
The generation gap;
Now feel this drumbeat
As it beats within
Playin' a riddim
Resisting against the system, ooh-wee!I know Jah's never let us down;
Pull your rights from wrong
(I know Jah would never let us down)
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
They made their world so hard (so hard):
Every day we got to keep on fighting (fighting);
They made their world so hard (so hard):
Every day the people are dyin' (dying), yeah!
(It dread, dread) For hunger (dread, dread) and starvation
(dread, dread, dread, dread)
Lamentation (dread dread)
But read it in Revelation (dread, dread, dread, dread):
You'll find your redemption
And then you give us the teachings of His Majesty
For we no want no devil philosophy;
A you fe give us the teachings of His Majesty
A we no want no devil philosophy:Feel it in the one drop;
And we still find time to rap;
We're making the one stop
And we filling the gap:
So feel this drumbeat
As it beats within
Playing a riddim, uh!
Fighting against ism and skism,Singing: I know Jah's never let us down;
Pull your rights from wrong:
I know Jah's never let us down
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
They made their world so hard
Every day (we got to keep on fighting), every day;
They made their world so hard
Every day (the people are dying), eh!
(dread, dread, it dread, dread) Oh, whoa! Make dem a-go on so:
(dread, dread, it dread on dread) Ah, whoa!
(dread, dread) I'll walk (it dread, dread)
Ah, whoa! Frighten dem, ah whoa!
(dread, dread) Ah, whoa! Frighten dem, eh!
Give us the teachings of His Majesty - with a stick-up!
