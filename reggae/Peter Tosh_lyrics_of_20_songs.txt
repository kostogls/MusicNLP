Deep down in Jamaica, close to Mandeville
Back up in the woods, on top of a hill
There stood an old hut made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named, Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read and write so well
But he could play his guitar like ringin' a bell, yell

I said go, go Johnny!
Johnny be good tonight! Yeah ah
I said go, go Johnny!
Johnny B. Goode...

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Dee-oo-doo, dee-oo-doo
Sitting in a tree in the railroad track
Dee-oo-doo, dee-oo-doo
Old engineer in the train sittin' in the shade
Choo-chooooo
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
Dee-oo-doo, dee-oo-doo
People passing by would stop and say:
Dee-oo-doo, dee-oo-doo
"Oh my, oh my, oh what a boy can play"
I said go, go Johnny!
Johnny be good tonight!
Said go, go Johnny!
Johnny B. Goode...


Mama said: "Son, you gotta be a man
Go, be a man
You got to be the leader of a reggae band"
Skengay skengay, skengay skengay
People comin' in from miles around
Dee-oo-doo, dee-oo-doo
To hear you play until the sun goes down
Dee-oo-doo, dee-oo-doo
Boy, someday your name will be in the lights
Dee-oo-doo, dee-oo-doo
Sayin' "JOHNNY - JOHNNY B. GOODE TONITE"

I said go, go Johnny!
Johnny be good tonight! Yeah ah
Said go, go Johnny!
Johnny you better be good
Said go, go Johnny!
Johnny be good tonight!
Play! Go Johnny!
Johnny B. Goode...
I said go go, go, go go Johnny!

Oh bumbo klaat, oh ras klaat
Oh bumbo klaat, oh ras klaat

I said I came upon this land
To guide and teach my fellow man
But one thing I can't overstand
Is why them don't love his brother man

Oh bumbo klaat, oh ras klaat
Oh bumbo klaat, oh ras klaat

Sometimes I sit and look around
And listen to the daily sound
But when I check, there's so much lies
And that's the reason why the children cry

It's been so long, we need a change
So the shitstem we got to rearrange
And if there's obstacles in the road
We got to throw them overboard
Oh bumbo klaat, oh ras klaat
Oh bumbo klaat, oh ras klaat

One night, an evil spirit held me down
I could not make one single sound
Until Jah told me, "Son, use the word"
And now I'm as free as a bird

The rich man's wealth is in the city
Vexation of the soul is vanity
Destruction of the poor is their poverty
The poor man's wealth is in a holy place
Why do you fight each other?
Why do you kill your brother?
Then your reward will be the cemetery
We got to build a better nation
Clean up, clean up Jah creation
Or there will be no future for you, you and meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Said If you live in a glasshouse
Don't throw stones
And if you can't take blows brother
Don't throw blows
If you live in a glasshouse
Don't throw stones
And if you can't take blows sister
Don't throw blows

Harm no man
Let no man harm you
Do unto others
As they would do to you
And to every baldhead
Respect the Rastaman
Cause he's the only man left on creation

And if you live in a glasshouse
Don't throw stones
And if you can't take blows brother
Don't throw blows
Said if you live in a glasshouse
Don't throw stones
And if you can't take blows sister
Don't throw blows
'Cause 'cause to see I
Looking so humble
Would you like to try something
But your world would-a crumble
Caught behind I back
You lied to grumble
And before I face
You always a fumble, yeah

And if you live in a glasshouse
Don't throw stones
And if you can't take blows brother
Don't throw blows
Said if you live in a glasshouse
Don't throw stones
And if you can't take blows sister
Don't throw blows


You build your world on lies and illusions
But you never know that
This is the conclusion
No chance no hope for those
Who kept it a-goin'
Cause you never know that
The truth was showing
And if you live in a glasshouse
Don't throw stones
And if you can't take blows brother
Don't throw blows
Said if you live in a glasshouse
Don't throw stones
And if you can't take blows sister
Don't throw blows

I'm on this earth
To give Jah praise
And all I ask for
Is longer days
I come to do the things that are right
And if you don't like my do it we're gonna fight

And if you live in a glasshouse
Don't throw stones
And if you can't take blows brother
Don't throw blows
If you live in a glasshouse
