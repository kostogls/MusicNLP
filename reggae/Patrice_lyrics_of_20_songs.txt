Now we’re walking down an alley
Now I’m talking spiritually
We got one eye on the future
And the other on our money
And all our feeling goes dead
When we switch on that channel
So over fed with the terrible flannel
Try to switch off my head
Use my soul instead
So I’ll get ahead of these things
I said
(Chorus)
There’s a soul
Soul
A soulstorm everywhere
It’s a everywhere
Everywhere
A soulstorm everywhere

I was taught that talk is cheap
And I have learned that love is deep
God gave me my soul to keep
So I talk love a whole big heap
And I will not point a finger
For it is timeless and will linger
I keep my own words down
So I won’t drown
Repeat one more time, don’t hinder
There’s a soul
Soul
A soulstorm everywhere
It’s a everywhere
Everywhere
A soulstorm everywhere

There’s a soul
Soul
A soulstorm everywhere
It’s a everywhere
Everywhere
A soulstorm everywhere

Some people might be wondering
Is his head in the clouds
And no ground under him
What the so and so’s he on about
So I’ll just break it down, down (no doubt)

I got up out of bed one misty morning
Found myself sitting there and brainstorming
About how to be true without being corny
Do some soulstorming
Must be the benefit of the global warming
I realised that there ain’t no harm in
Planting soul and a little farming
Do some soul farming
Soul…

There’s a soul
Soul
A soulstorm everywhere
It’s a everywhere
Everywhere
A soulstorm everywhere

There’s a soul
Soul
A soulstorm everywhere
It’s a everywhere
Everywhere
A soulstorm everywhere

There’s a soul
Soul
A soulstorm everywhere
It’s a everywhere
Everywhere
A soulstorm everywhere

There’s a soul
Soul
A soulstorm everywhere
It’s a everywhere
Everywhere
A soulstorm everywhere1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Monday is my day Tuesday is my day
Wednesday to Friday to Sunday is my day
Tripping on the highway
Mind on these flowers
And the powers in my psyche
Lord God Almighty
Would like to find Afrodite
And make her my wifey
But first got to win all this fighting
For the soul that's inside me
They're just noisy like thunder
We are striking like lightning
Peace and love to the people
Let's bring light to this world
Peace and love to my people
Let us fight for this world
We are hippies with guns hear them sing wadadadangdang
Music is my only weapon
I shoot to kill them with every song
We are hippies with guns hear them sing wadadadangdang
We may not live to see tomorrow sun
Live today like you can't die and can't done
Monday is my day Tuesday is my day
Wednesday to Friday to Sunday is my day
Music is my way to murder like Ini
When it hits you don't feel no pain
That's highly unlikely
Someone ring the sireenes
We're gangsters with guitars
Riding with timing
Skatebording with Nile
Jah Mike's give me my Key
Look the city then go country
And farm under pine trees
Peace and love to the people
Let's bring light to this world
Peace and love to my people
Let us fight for this world

We are hippies with guns hear them sing wadadadangdang
Music is my only weapon
Shoot to kill them with every song
We are hippies with guns hear them sing wadadadangdang
We may not live to see another sun
Live today like you can't die and can't done1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Take me away
Them false prophets want to lead I astray
I beg you father shine on my way
I say, thy name shall be praised, thy name shall be praised
I say, thy name shall be praised, thy name shall be praised

Life about here is inhuman
Babylon is no place for a man who doesen't worship illusions Who believes in all truth and love and in the Almighty One
They pressurize you from yourself all day long
Give you bad influence until your eyes ears and your heart lock down
They lead you from the right road right into confusion
And when you speak up, all of them mock at you and take it for fun
Well, the truth they take for fun

Jah, Jah hear my song
Take me away
Them false prophets want to lead I astray
I beg you father shine on my way
I say, thy name shall be praised, thy name shall be praised
I say, thy name shall be praised, thy name shall be praised

Them all worship illusion
Long time I've thought I could have changed their plan
But I gave in because they don't want no change to be done
To live at the expense of the poor - that, I just can't stand -
That, I just don't want
That's why I leave this land
I want to rule my destiny, I don't want to put it in their hand
So take me away from babylon civilization
'Cause they thieve the power from I-man
Jah, Jah hear my song
Take me away
Them false prophets want to lead I astray
I beg you father shine on my way
I say, thy name shall be praised, thy name shall be praised
I say, thy name shall be praised, thy name shall be praisedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Last night when i went to bed
I wrote this letter in my head
I was too spaced out for you to reach me
I used to teach you now you teach me
I never thought that you were gonna realise
What you had inside, so now I'm well suprised
They say my head is in the clouds
They say my head is in the clouds
Cloud nine to be precised

You see the world is turning on
And somethings are
Just the way they are they are
The world is turning on
And somethings are
Just the way they, just the way they are

I take the best words that come to my mind
The nicest melody that i can find
I write the greatest song that i can write
To bring you back into my life
Back then god had sent me to make you angry
To send you on your journey
Coz there were things you had to learn
They say my head is in the clouds
They say my head is in the clouds
Cloud nine to be precised
You see our world ain't in this world
You see our world ain't in this world
Cloud nine to be precise

The world is turning on
And somethings are
Just the way they are they are
The world is turning on
And somethings are
Just the way they just the way they are

I turn my back on this
It wouldn't change a thing
It's just the way it is
You couldn't change a thing
It's been from ever since
From before time begins
I surrender all there is no joy like this again
You take all my songs
I wrote them for you
See I didn't know
I only thought i knew
You were invisible
Now you visible
Was I too blind to see
Like the sun it dawns on me

The world is turning on
And somethings are
Just the way they are they are
The world is turning on
And somethings are
Just the way they just the way they areEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Feeding my demons, they get stronger everyday
I'm feeding my angels so they can take me away
Stop feeding my demons, they get stronger everyday
I'm feeding my angels so they can take me away
Away, away

My demons called me pussy, they say prove that you're a man
I told 'em I may not female and they laughed and said "You're not half a man"
They say "Girls only hurt you, so don't treat them well"
The day you open up, does send you to hell
Hell, oh well, oh well

Feeding my demons, they get stronger everyday
I'm feeding my angels so they can take me away
Stop feeding my demons, they get stronger everyday
I'm feeding my angels so they can take me away
Away, away, away

I took all of the 
 imaginary 
Put a fence around my house, god to save  me 
But now my guns started talking and says "You're just half a man"
And unless I hold it, they talks again and again and again
Feeding my demons, they get stronger everyday
I'm feeding my angels so they can take me away
Stop feeding my demons, they get stronger everyday
I'm feeding my angels so they can take me away
Away, away


Feeding the demons, they get stronger everyday
I'm feeding my angels so they can take me away
Stop feeding my demons, they get stronger everyday

This one is
Dedicated to the truth
This is Babatunde the original conscious youth
When I look in your eyes I can feel the sun come rise
It seems like you give me the thing I was missing in my life
The thing I gave up to search
Cause I thought I'm not going to find
But how could I find when there is no light in my night
'how could I find when there are clouds and no sunshine?
You fill me up with joy. every moment's a suprise
You set me free from Babylon. you make me leave this place for
Miles
You're no illusion. no, you are the truth
Never forget, it's you, always you
Na. na. na
Na. na. na. na
It's you, always you, my sweet dream
Yes you are my earth and you make me give birth to
Melodies and thoughts, enliven by your love
Yes, I'm a global villager, but you give me home
Wherever I may wonder, wherever I may roam
While I write this song the world around me disappears
I dip into my thoughts and I speak this niseless prayer
Lord of lords and king of kings. conquering lion, Jah Jah
Almightly One who arts im mount Zion
I beg you guide and protect the woman I call queen of
Queens and dreams lioness reflection of patrice
You are right the word restricts the sense
But I think you know what I mean I mean what I really
Mean when I call You my sweet dream
Na. na. na
Na. na. na. na
It's you, always you, my sweet dream
When I look in your eyes I can feel the sun come rise
It seems like you give me the thing I was missing in my life
The thing I gave up to search
Cause I thought I'm not going to find
But how could I find when there is no light in my night
'how could I find when there are clouds and no sunshine?
You fill me up with joy. every moment's a suprise
You set me free from Babylon. you make me leave this place for

Don't give up the fight no no
Everyday is good, because of being alive
-from the day I was born till the day me ago die
In high tide and in low tide I know that Jah will always be by my side
He might the one that carries me through the night
Everyday he makes me open my eyes, and I will never give up the fight
No, and I will never give up my pride and if tomorrow I shall die, I know that today is good because I am alive
-chorus-
Oh, mother nature, often me I disrespect you but I love you
Oh, father Jah Jah, many times I do not appreciate the things were you giving me
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, but I don't have no fear
Cause I know that at the end of the day, Jah Jah will be waiting there

And when I feel
Life's heavy labours calling
I make my self
Light as light
I think of things
As they come to me
Without warning
A train of thoughts passing through on the tracks
Sunshine
We be cruising
It's in our music
That's where the truth is
Cos we have done
That cos we haven't been there
I wanna go there
Cos we will run that
I wanna go for real
See the sun shine
In winter time see snow falling in summer time
It's all crazy like our minds
All this anger makes us blind
For all these poisons that are mine
I know I can not rewind
As I struggle to be more kind
As the train lies
And I mess around
I'm so young but not without a sound
Been seen double,keeping me down
I fiddle with a thought
But not without a sound
Sunshine
We be cruising
It's in our music
That's where the truth is
Cos we have done
That cos we haven't been there
I wanna go there
Cos we will run that
I wanna go for real
(I wanna feel it
I wanna be there
I want you to feel it
The way that I feel it
Don't you conceal it
Come on reveal it
You better kiss me
You better love your self.)
My body and your body
Can fuse into one
Shadow on the wall
Your body and my body
Produce somebody
A soundbody
Just look what we conjured
Out of nowhere like the notes
That thrill the air
Sunshine
We be cruising
It's in our music
That's where the truth is
Cos we have done
That cos we haven't been there
I wanna go there
Cos we will run that
I wanna go for real

I wanna be there
I want you to feel it
The waythat I feel it
Don't you conceal it

Love don't have to hurt
Forget, forget who you once were
No you're wrong to beat the song
With your head against the wall
You're just too proud to make the call
Please respond, you've lost it all

I thank the Lord for making ripples in the sky
Can't just sit around and cry

We were born in an open war
Can't remember how it was before
Born in an open war
Can't remember how it was before
Wakey Wakey clack boom!
Light up the night
With the bridges I burn

On this open road
Don't know where but we'll just go
In my old red cameo
And if I find you in the dust
I'll clean you up and call the bus
We'll be home when we want to
I thank the Lord for making ripples in the sky
Won't just sit around and cry
Let's go too far drop the pedal and we fly
Oh baby, at least we try

We were born in an open war
Can't remember how it was before
Born in an open war
Wakey Wakey clack boom!
Born in an open war
Can't remember how it was before
Wakey Wakey clack boom!
Light up the night
With the bridges I burn
Never gonna to learn, never gonna learn
Light up the night with the bridges I burn
Never gonna to learn, never gonna learn
Light up the night with the bridges I burn
Never gonna to learn, never gonna learn
Light up the night with the bridges I burn

We were born in an open war
Can't remember how it was before
Born in an open war
Wakey Wakey clack boom!
Born in an open war
Can't remember how it was before

And everything I say is to you
And my tears running rivers
They run to you
And now that I feel I know you do

You’re crazy let’s see who’s crazier
You or me !
Be with me
Just be with me
And you will see

You said that you’ll jump, so jump already
Broke the glass of our picture to cut yourself
But it’s the unspoken that cuts the deepest
I can’t make you love yourself

You’re crazy let’s see who’s crazier

I will change the world today
I don't care what the people say
There's a brighter day to come
Cause I'm a rebel, I kill the devil

I was so close to resigning
Saying fuck the world and just move to an island
All of these people seek dem neon enlightenments
We are blinded
World leaders too money minded
(But then)
Music is my mission and jah works my assignement
I come from Iceland, Freetown salon, land of diamonds
We're pushing stones bigger than a girl in the 9th month
See Americans ah turn the world in a timebomb
We ain't got no hoods, we have real slums
Where ten year olds have you leaving
On two hands with two stumps
And no clothes and no funds
I was deep down in a hole giving up my life once
So insecure I couldn't even see the sky once
So my energy would grow out of silence
How you gonna change the world?
I will change it with my hands
We haffi response before the rivers run dry
And the stars fall from the sky these days
Love is just a word but I will try and
I will change the world today
I don't care what the people say
There's a brighter day to come
Cause I'm a rebel, I kill the devil
I will change the world today
I'm gonna pave the way
For a brighter day to come
Cause I'm a rebel, I kill the devil

I failed, I lied, betrayed, got played
Was scared, was blind, not straight, had hate
Gone astray, was lost, was vain, loved fame
But my strength of today lays in yesterday's pain
I stole, was sold, was bold, I chilled
I killed, I fell, I rose, you know
I've lost a fight before
But I won't lose the war

I will change the world today
I don't care what the people say
There's a brighter day to come
Cause I'm a rebel, I kill the devil
This ain't about the bad ones, it's about the one who no care
Who's too fat to be bothered, too lazy and scared
To whom changing this world, would mean send his world to hell
And destroy an illusion, that served him so well, yeah
Good things never come easy, start with reflection of self
To some this might sound cheesy, but the truth afi tell, yeah
Some caught up in survival, think it's them that need help, yeah
You never know that material, 'could never be wealth, yeah

I will change the world today
I don't care what the people say
There's a brighter day to come
Cause I'm a rebel, I kill the devil
I will change the world today
I'm gonna pave the way
For a brighter day to come

When my feet were in shackles
And my hands were in chains
You took my mind and made it settle
In a land so far away
When I was toiling in the fields (yeah)
You made me push on through
Yes I'm head over heels
Over heels in love with you
Yes I'm head over heels
Over heels in love with you

When I was in the womb
You made me wanna see this world
Every setting of the moon
I dreamt of you being my girl
Say ooh I can't deny
Without you I would be dead
And the day that I die
I die with you in my head
Yes the day that I die
I die with you in my head
In my head in my head

There's just no get away
When you're dancing in my brain
When I'm cruising on your waves
Coulda never go astray (ooh)
Everything is music
I just put parts in a frame
To capture this very moment
And never let it go away
They use you and abuse you
And treat you like a thing
Forever I'll be faithful
Have your back untill the end
Forever I'll be faithful
Have your back untill the end

There's just no get away
When you're dancing in my brain
When I'm cruising on your waves

CHORUS
How do you call it when autumn leaves keep falling?
Tell me how do you mean it?
You think I was dreaming not feeling
I was feeling for you as I was falling for you
(Say) I need your love so bad
You make me feel so close to God
You deal with the truth of the heart (yeah)
And you have so much of that
Tell me what do we have but love (yeah)
There's nothing much I could think of
You run from love like you're in a rush
But anything love builds your doubts will crush
CHORUS
Ohhh ohhh
(Say) girl you have those eyes
I'd do anything for you if they cried
Even when you curse
I love to watch your lips building bad words
When ever we be talking on the phone
I just love to hear your tone
Even silence sounds good with you
(Say) girl you have so much soul
CHORUS
How do you call it?
How do you mean it? (how do you mean it?)
I was feeling (I was feeling)
As I was falling (I was falling)
I was feeling for you,as I was falling for you, my soul was crying for you, as I was dying for you as l was falling for you (rpt)

Forever and always we know who we are
The blood in my veins came from afar
What will you do when I’m walking ?
What if I’m done with the talking ?
What will you do ?
We are the future in the present
And though the past it tried to kill us yet we made it
We are the future in the present
And though the past it tried to kill us yet we made it
And we do it with the class and style.
We cut and we clear, we sign and we seal
Not playing the game with the cost that you deal
What would you do when we’re walking ?
What if we’re done with the talking ?
What would you do ?
We are the future in the present
And though the past it tried to kill us yet we made it
We are the future in the present
And though the past it tried to kill us yet we made it
And we do it with the class and style.
We’re real queens and kings
We are why the caged birds sings
Things don’t happen to us we happen to things
Happening, happening - we are happening
Dap-dap-dapper when we turn up the melanin
Fufu pounded yam
curves curves curves ...
We are the future in the present
And all the past they tried to kill us yet we made it
We are the future in the present
And all the past they tried to kill us yet we made itEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Come an hold me tight she said
Feels so right
Can you check if it’s full moon tonight
I never felt this way and I wonder way
See this vibe I’m feeling ain’t normal
Believe me all I want is for you to hold me tight
And she say
Usually it’s not my style maybe the hormones are going wild
She say I need you to need me the way that I need you though I know this is never wise
I’m lonely lonely lo
You are the only one I want
My mama warned me of your type
My father would have shot you down on sight
Who controls this tides
I’m high and I’m low same time
Want to go fast and slow alike
Done roll the dices
My only choice is to obey this voice inside
I’m lonely lonely lo
You are the only one I want
My mama warned me of your type
My father would have shot you down on sight
Come an hold me tight, baby come an hold me tight
Feels so right
And I say
Not one thing is free in life I gladly pay whatever price
But I’ll be gone in the morning at first light
When you yawn an empty pillow is all you’ll find
Are you sure you have made your choice
I am a man that don’t keep no ties
God first, then my youth, then my music then you
When you could have any other man you like
She say..

You are the only one I want

All the things you made believe
Things we said we should achieve
You took it all like a thieve
Why'd you do that?
Till that day I was so naive
But then I saw a face
I had never seen
You wear a different one anytime you leave
I never knew that!
Bowing down to who's above
While looking down on who's below
Looks are deceiving
I believe in something
Bigger than me
Looks are deceiving
I believe in something
Bigger than me
Wearing FACES
A screw face knows who to frighten
Who to profile and who to beguile
Her pretty faces knows who to blind
And when to tell lies
And when to be nice
The aloof face
Makes you wanna find things you cannot find out
And you'll keep trying
God forbid that we lose face
Show me your true face
And I'll show you mine
Bowing down to who's above
While looking down on who's below
Looks are deceiving
I believe in something
Bigger than me
Looks are deceiving
I believe in something
Bigger than me
Wearing FACES
Swim with the tide sway with the wind
Join the choir along your sing
Sell out to win
I don't kow you!
Faceless shadowless
In between more or less
And more and more
At what expense...I don't know, you?
Looks are deceiving
I believe in something
Bigger than me
Looks are deceiving
I believe in something
Bigger than me

Bang bang
I am making a ghost
When my gun barrel smokes
Poor thing jumped out of her clothes
Her body dropped undressing her
Another girl with a broken heart
The world just doesn't need
Not one more lonely thought
Singing a sad song
I'm begging please
I do anything
Bang bang
I am making a ghost
When my gun barrel smokes
Poor thing jumped out of her clothes
Her body dropped undressing her
Another girl with a broken heart
The world just doesn't need
Not one more lonely thought
Singing a sad song
I'm begging please
I do anything
Woi woi woi
Never wanna see my girl
Cry Cry Cry
No way no way
Woi woi woi
Never wanna see a girl
Cry Cry Cry
Again I say
Woi woi woi
Never wanna see my girl
Cry cry cry again
I say woi woi woi
Rather I would wanna die
Rather I would wanna die
Bang bang
He was putting her down
Ice cold
Like America
Pour thing was enjoying the ride
She thought she was on a marry go round
Bad boys move in silence girl
The night is still with no soul around
So smooth
No violence now
Hush don't make a sound
Woi woi woi
Never wanna see my girl
Cry Cry Cry
No way no way
Woi woi woi
Never wanna see a girl
Cry Cry Cry
Again I say
Woi woi woi
Never wanna see my girl
Cry cry cry again
I say woi woi woi
Rather I would wanna die
Rather I would wanna die
Woi woi woi
Never wanna see my girl
Cry Cry Cry
No way no way
Woi woi woi
Never wanna see a girl
Cry Cry Cry
Again I say
Woi woi woi
Never wanna see my girl
Cry cry cry again
I say woi woi woi
Rather I would wanna die
Rather I would wanna dieEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
