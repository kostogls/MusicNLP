On a cargo ship ('Cause)

Though, a boy they call Philly Freddie
Ten pound a cocaine in his belly

But he was digging his own grave
So they put him on the next plane
Send him back to J.A
Dip 'em again (Two pound a coke on dem)
Dip 'em again
Bust him again (Cocaine in him belly an' dem)
Bust him again (Bong-ding-dong-ding-dong-ding)
