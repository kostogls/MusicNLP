...demonstrates while we wait to conflate the economy. Inflation is high, will it stay under control as the economy revives because of a steep drop in oil prices...

In the quest for the test to fulfill an achievement
Everybody's always going to pursue themselves
When the fact of the matter is they just don't care
To extend a helping hand to anyone else
So tell me uh-why, did you have to lie?
And try to make me all confused about the U.S.A
When the fact of the matter is you just don't hear
To comprehend or understand a single word I say

I don't wanna have I go against I
I don't wanna have I go against I
Well let me tell ya

The same old story, no fact or glory
I against I against I against I against (Ooh)
I say I don't like it, and I know I don't want it
I against I against I against I against I a⁠—(Ooh)

About the drugs, mugs, bugs, and the police thugs
About the rotten, stinkin' rackets and the fantasy
Around the nation, around the nation
Oh what you gonna do?

Oh baby, baby, baby what you gonna do?
I tell you the truth is lookin' straight at you


Come on
I know I got a brass continental with a 300 Z

For all my family, around the nation

I make decisions with precision
Lost inside this manned collision
Just to see that what to be is
Perfectly my fantasy
I came to know with now dismay
That in this world we all must pay
Pay to write, pay to play
Pay to cum, pay to fight

And all in time, with just our minds
We soon will find what's left behind

Not long ago, when things were slow
We all got by with what we know
The end is near, hearts filled with fear
Don't want to listen to what they hear
And so it's now we choose to fight
To stick up for our bloody right
The right to ring, the right to dance
The right is ours, we'll take the chance

At peace together, apiece apart
A piece of wisdom from our hearts3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You don't want me anymore
So I just walked right out that door
I play the game right from the start
I trust you, you use me, now my life's all torn apart

So I'm sailing, yeah, I'm sailing on
I'm moving, yeah, I'm moving on
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on

Tried to see if I'll give up
But there wasn't any luck
It's a fact, a fact of life
That's the game, game of strife everything is all in stride

So I'm sailing, well, I'm sailing on
I'm moving, well, I'm moving on
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on


So I'm sailing, yeah, I'm sailing on
I'm moving, yeah, I'm moving on
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on
Too many years with too many tears
And too many days with none to say
So how will we know when there's nowhere to grow
The fact of life, life too short, oh2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Cosmopolitan reflection well thin
When our action cause reaction what starts
A transmission of a love in one heart

Re-ig-ni-tion

That this gross sphere is not Jah land
Apart-outside, who can escape
Our destiny, confirmed in fate

No celesty ever resting begin
When grace melts inside your hand and my heart
Is the glory that much closer or apart

I like to cram their chivalry inside their guts
I'd like to leave it all behind with the rest of the nuts

I'd like to forget about you and try to break it somehow
I'd like to push it aside until I can see some more
I'd like to leave you where I found you lying on the floor
I, oh

I guess it's too bad, I guess its too bad
I guess it's too bad, too bad
