Put yo' hand up on yo' head
Jump up and spread
Before I make a move and soon buck you down dead
Put yo' hand up on yo' head

1 - Bad boys, bad boys
What'cha gonna do
What'cha gonna do when they come for you?
Bad boys, bad boys
What'cha gonna do
What'cha gonna do when they come for you?

What's the reason for the harass?
All up in my ass
Be bubblin' in my stomach like gas (damn)
I feel the grass smoke circulatin' through my vains
Thankful, in control of the brain, not goin' insane
Yo, check 'em at a very young age
He gon' make the front page
Too bad they caught you out the blitz with the 12 gauge
They got mommy screamin' all in the rangin', changin'
Re-arrangin' the atmosphere
I guess your moms shoulda made the message much clearer
In your ear
Maybe you learned your lesson, count your blessin's
And the ? is like this
You really know it is gettin' bad
When they shootin' babies up in shitty diapers
So run, go get your ten, wipe this
We'll make ya welcome test real, out the blue
Tell me what you fo' do, when the bad boys comin' fo' you
Put yo' hand up on yo' head
Jump up and spread
Before I make a move and soon buck you down dead
Repeat 1

Nobody now gettin' no break
Boys now give ya no break
Nah, oh, soldier man'll give you no break
Not ? nah, give ya no breaks, hey hey
Repeat 1

Uh-oh, yo, I check (see, here they come)
I figure that it's the bad boys playin' the diggy-dum-dum-dum
Yo, what do you want with my life?
Ya see me on the block tryin' to sell my rock
But how do you make a deal with a nigga
Played until your head tock
(Tek, tell 'em how to head 'em)
Maybe it's time for me to quit (why?)
'Cause I'm tired of all the bullshit
Snakes fickin' all over my grave
It's my age, feel like I'm runnin' with slaves
I'm on the next SOUL train
Soon ?? fool procrastinate and immitate
Whether you're phony or fake, it's just how you hate
How you gonna knock me in the belly of the beast
When I'm already doin' time in the New York streets
So run around, go get your gats
Don't forget your crew
Tell me what'cha gonna do
'Cause the bad boys comin' for you
Repeat 1 to fadeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Isn't it strange how princesses and kings
Can clown their capers in sawdust rings, just like
Poor people like you and me
Will be builders for eternity
Each is given a bag of tools
Shapeless lives and a book of rules
Each must make his life as flowing ink
Tumbling back on a stepping stone, just like
Poor people like you and me
Will be builders for eternity
Each is given a bag of tools
Shapeless lives and a book of rules
Pow wa pow pow, pow wa pa pa pow pow
Wa pa pa pow pow, wa pow pa pow pow pow
And I say small people like you and me
Will be builders for eternity
Each is given a bag of tools
Shapeless lives and a book of rules (note 1)
Look where the rain is fallen from the sky
I know the sun will be only missing for awhile
And I say small people like you and me
Will be builders for eternity
Each is given a bag of tools
Shapeless lives and a book of rules
Pow wa pow pow, pow wa pa pa pow pow
Wa pa pa pow pow, wa pow pa pow pow pow
And I say small people like you and me

I was born a disciplined child
Never knew how I got so wild
I was born a disciplined child
Never knew how I got so wild
When I used to go to school
They taught me the golden rule
They said "Son you better know yourself
'Cause in times to come, it's gonna be dread"
I didn't heed this advice
Now I've got to pay the price
I didn't heed this advice
Now I've got to pay the price
Now I'm on death row, only one place to go
Now I'm on death row, only one place to go
Oh ma, I wish you were around
To see how they tracked me down
Oh ma, I wish you were around
To see how they tracked me down
They had me cornered in a little alley
A thousand shot guns over me
I never stood a chance, I didn't want to die
I had to reach for the sky
Now I'm on death row, only one place to go
Now I'm on death row, only one place to goEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

And buys a 20 carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly standing at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing, yes
In a couple of years
They have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running
In the yard of Desmond and Molly Jones
Don't worry be happy let the good vibes flow
Lyrics to lyrics to rock your soul
Lightnin' a flash and the thunder a roll
Music a play and we out control
Love is not gamble, love is not a toy
Love is just a thing that everybody enjoy
Don't worry be happy, make the good vibes flow
Big it up, big it up and let the whole world know
Ob-la-di-ob-la-da, life goes on, yeah
Na, na, na, na, life goes on
Ob-la-di-ob-la-da, life goes on, yeah

Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know; it's been comin' for some time
When it's over, so they say, it'll rain a sunny day
I know; shinin' down like water
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?
Yesterday, and days before, sun is cold and rain is hard
I know; been that way for all my time
'Til forever, on it goes through the circle, fast and slow
I know; it can't stop, I wonder
Yeah!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Whatever happened to my
Garden of black roses
Oh nurturing years of so long
Whatever happened to my
Garden of black roses
They say a stranger treated them wrong
When I was a boy
I planted a garden yeah
That meant so much to me
One of reality
A garden of love none like this
Before me
One of a kind equality
A prayer for you and me
Wo ho ho ho ho
Whatever happened to my
Garden of black roses
Oh nurturing years of so long
Whatever happened to my
Garden of black roses
They say a stranger treated them wrong
If we can keep
The candles burning
To shelter them from pain
And let them live again
Shower the world with their innocence
Who's tears felt like rain, history remains the same
Wo ho ho ho ho
But one by one they come up missing
Strangers thought that I was sleeping
Some life somelife means nothing to some
Watch out now we've got them on the run
Whatever happened to my
Garden of black roses
Oh nurturing years of so long
Whatever happened to my
Garden of black roses
They say a stranger treated them wrongEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You say you love me
I think you don't
You say you want me
But you change your mind every day
Talk about the times we shared
Loving you's my only care
My heart cries for you every day
But you don't want to hear me say
All I need
Is to be wrapped up
In your love, girl
Wrapped up
In your arms
Wrapped up
In your love tonight
Wrapped up
In your love tonight
Just one more thing, baby
After all we've been through
My love for you still rolls through
And when you call my name
Your force's like a burning flame
Of all the treasures that I adore
You're my crown and jewel
The one that i
Can't ignore
The way I feel about you
I can't live without you
What more can I say
I just can't keep living this way
Sometimes it hits like a rock
And that's when I don't look back
My heart cries for you every day
But you don't want to hear me say
All I need
Is to be wrapped up
In your love, girl
Wrapped up
In your arms
Wrapped up
In your love tonight
Wrapped up
In your love tonight
Come on, baby, give me some sugar
Oh, baby
Aw, when you do those things, you make shivers run up and down my spine
I just want to whisper in your ears, you see
All I need
Is to be wrapped up
In your love, girl
Wrapped up
In your arms
Wrapped up
In your love tonight
All I need
Is to be wrapped up
In your love, sugar
Wrapped up
In your arms
Wrapped up
In your love tonight
Wrapped up
In your love tonight
I love the way you make me feel, baby, just one more time
All I need
(Wrapped up)
Yes, baby
(Wrapped up)
In your love, baby
Wrapped up
In your love tonight
Wrapped up
In your love tonightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Dj
That is then and dis is now
Sing a song of praise and shout it out load
To reach Zion you have to be strong like a lion
Unity and strength divided we fall
Stand up for your right and pure in your want
Keep it in your mind and lock it in your thoughts

By the river of Babylon
Where we sat down
Yeah, where we wept when remembered Zion
For the wicked carried us away captivity
Required from us a song
Now, how can we sing king alpha song in strange land
Sing it loud, sing a song of freedom
Sing along brothers, sing along sisters
Oh, let the words of our mouths
And the meditation of our hearts
Be acceptable in thy sight oh for I
For the wicked carried us away captivity
Required from us a song in a strange land
Oh, Oh let the words
Let the words of my mouth
Be acceptable in thy sight
