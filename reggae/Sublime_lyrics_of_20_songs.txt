I don't practice Santeria, I ain't got no crystal ball
Well, I had a million dollars, but I, I'd spend it all
If I could find that jaina and that Sancho that she's found
Well, I'd pop a cap in sancho and I'd slap her down

What I really wanna know, ah, baby, mmm
What I really want to say, I can't define
Well, it's love that I need, oh
My soul will have to

Wait 'til I get back, find a jaina of my own
Daddy's gonna love one and all
I feel the break, feel the break, feel the break, and I got' live it up
Oh, yeah, huh, well, I swear that I

What I really wanna know, ah, baby
What I really want to say, I can't define
Got love, make it go
My soul will have to

Mmm, what I really wanna say, ah, baby
What I really wanna say is, "I've got mine
And I'll make it, yes, I'm comin' up"
Tell Sanchito that

If he knows what is good for him, he best go run and hide
Daddy's got a new .45
And I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down Sancho's throat
Believe me when I say that I got something for his punk ass

What I really wanna know, my baby
Ooh, what I really wanna say is, "There's just one"
Way back, and I'll make it, yeah
My soul will have to wait

Yeah, yeah, yeah94EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Fuck, you can't even sing

Early in the mornin', risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet
Got to find the reason, reason things went wrong
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot

Well, life is (too short), so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start no static, I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity-ty-ty-ty
Love is what I got, it's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve
Try and test that, you're bound to get served
Love's what I got, don't start a riot
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot

Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
And remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
(I got, I got, I got)
Why I don't cry when my dog runs away
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Fuckin' and fightin'; it's all the same
Living with Louie Dog's the only way to stay sane
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me

Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
And remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got

Mucho gusto, me llamo Bradley
I’m hornier than Ron Jeremy
And if you wanna get popped in your knee
Just wipe that look off your batty face
You hate me 'cause I got what you need
A pretty little daughter that we call, "Mexi"
If you wanna get beat physically, it will be over in a minute if ya...
So, she told me to come over and I took that trip
And then she pulled out my mushroom tip
And when it came out, it went, drip-drip-drip
I didn’t know she had the G.I. Joe kung-fu grip

And it went, "uh"
And the girl caress me down
"Uh", and that’s that loving sound
And it went, "uh"
And the girl caress me down
"Uh", and that’s that loving sound

When I kiss Mexi, she makes me feel horny
'Cause I’m the type of lover with the sensitivity
When she kiss my neck and tickle me fancy
She give me the right kind of lovin on Sunday morning
En otro lado, es donde viví
Con mijita, que se llama, "Mexi"
Y su hermana, sí me quiere
Y ahorita, tenemos un bebé
Sus padres, sus tíos, me trataron matar
But they did not get too far
Un poco después tuve que regresar
Con un chingo de dinero, 'cause you know I’m a star
Yo fui a Costa Rica para tomar y surfear
Platicaba con la raza, 'cause they know who we are
Si no me dió cuenta than I bet you never will
You must be a muñeca if you’re still standing still
And we ball, "uh"
The girl caress me down
"Uh", and that’s the loving sound
We go, "uh"
And the girl caress me down
And that’s the loving sound

Me gusta mi reggae
Me gusta punk rock
Pero la cosa que me gusta más, es panochita
Pon la nalga en el aire if you know who you are
Pon la nalga en el aire, empieza gritar
No tenga miedo, I’m your papí
Take your chones y los manden a mí
Levanta, levanta, tienes que gritar
Levanta, levanta, tienes que bailar

Because, "uh"
The girl caress me down
"Uh", and that’s the loving sound
"Uh", and the girl caress me down
That’s the loving sound
"Uh"
Caress me down
"Uh", that's the lovin' sound
"Uh", and the girls caress me down
That’s the loving sound22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When you grab a hold of me
You tell me that I'll never be set free
But I'm a parasite
Creep and crawl, I step into the night

Two pints of booze
Tell me, are you a badfish, too?
(Are you a badfish, too?)

But, I
Ain't got no money to spend
I hope the night will never end
Lord knows I'm weak
Won't somebody get me off of this reef?

Baby, you're a big blue whale
Grab the reef when all duck divin' fails
I swim, but I wish I never learned
The water's too polluted with germs

I dive deep when it's ten feet overhead
Grab the reef underneath my bed (It's underneath my bed)

But, I
Ain't got no quarrels with God
Ain't got no time to grow old
Lord knows I'm weak
Won't somebody get me off of this reef?

Annie's twelve years old, in two more, she'll be a whore
Nobody ever told her it's the wrong way
Don't be afraid
With the quickness, you get laid
For your family, get paid
It's the wrong way

I gave her all that I had to give
I'm gonna make it hard to live
Salty tears running down to her chin
And it ruins up her makeup
And never wan' give
A cigarette pressed between her lips
But I'm staring at her tits, it's the wrong way
Strong if I can, but I am only a man
So I take her to the can
It's the wrong way

The only family that she's ever had
Is her seven horny brothers and a drunk ass dad
He needed money, so he put her on the street
Everything was going fine, until the day she met me
Happy are you sad, wanna shoot your dad?
I'll do anything I can, the wrong way
We talk all night, tried to make it right
Believe me, shit was tight
It was the wrong way
Don't run away, if you wanna stay
Cause I ain't here to make you, oh, no
It's up to you what you really want to do
Spend some time in America
Dub style!


She'll give you all that she's got to give
But I'm gonna make it hard to live
Big, salty tears rolling down to her chin
And it smears up her makeup
An' never wan' give
So, we ran away
And I'm sorry when I say that straight to this very day
It was the wrong way
She did the hike, don't matter if I like it, or not
Because she only wants the wrong way
I gave her all that I had to give
She still wouldn't take it, whoa, no
Her two brown eyes are leaking like a sieve
And it still ruins her makeup, and never wan' give17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

("I don't know if you can
But can you get an owner for Ons, that's O-N-S, Junior Market?
The address is 1934, East Anaheim
All the windows are busted out, and it's like a free-for-all in here
And, uh, the owner should at least come down here
And see if he can secure his business, if he wants to...")

April 26th, 1992
There was a riot on the streets, tell me, where were you?
You were sitting home, watching your TV
While I was participatin' in some anarchy
First spot we hit it was my liquor store
I finally got all that alcohol I can't afford
With red lights flashing, time to retire
And then we turned that liquor store into a structure fire
Next stop we hit it was the music shop
It only took one brick to make that window drop
Finally, we got our own P.A
Where do you think I got this guitar that you're hearing today?
Hey!

("Call fire and tell them to respond at a Mobil station
Alamitos and Anahiem

"10-4, Alamitos and Anaheim")
Homicide, never doin' no time

When we returned to the pad to unload everything
It dawned on me that I need new home furnishings
So, once again, we filled the van until it was full
Since that day, my living room's been much more comfortable
'Cause everybody in the hood has had it up to here
It's getting hotter, and hotter and harder, each and every year
Some kids went in a store with their mother
I saw her when she came out, she was getting some Pampers
They said it was for the black man
They said it was for the Mexican, and not for the white man
But if you look at the street, it wasn't about Rodney King
And this fucked up situation, and these fucked up police
It's about coming up and staying on top
And screaming, "187 on a motherfuckin' cop"
It's not in the paper, it's on the wall
National Guard
Smoke from all around
Bo, bo, bo!

We took this trip to Garden Grove
It smelt like Lou Dog inside the van, oh yeah
This ain't no funky reggae party, five dollars at the door
It gets so real sometimes, who wrote my rhyme?
I've got the microwave, got the VCR
I got the deuce-deuce in the trunk of my car, oh yeah

If you only knew that all the love that I've found
It's hard to keep my soul on the ground

You're a fool
Don't fuck around with my dog
All that I can see, I steal; I fill up my garage
'Cause in my mind

Music from Jamaica, all the love that I found
Pull over, there's a reason why my soul's unsound

It's you
It's that shit stuck under my shoe
It's that smell inside the van
It's my bed sheet covered with sand
Sittin' through a shitty band
Gettin' dog shit on my hand
Gettin' hassled by the man
Wakin' up to an alarm
Stickin' needles in your arm
Pickin' up trash on the freeway
Feelin' depressed every day
Leaving without making a sound
Pickin' my dog up at the pound
Livin' in a tweeker pad
Gettin' yelled at by my dad
Sayin' I'm happy when I'm not
Findin' roaches in the pot
All these things I do
They're waiting for you15EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"She was living in a single room with three other individuals. One of them was a male and the other two, well, the other two were females. God only knows what they were up to in there. And furthermore, Susan, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to learn that all four of them habitually smoke marijuana cigarettes... Reefers."

I smoke two joints in the morning
I smoke two joints at night
I smoke two joints in the afternoon, it makes me feel alright
I smoke two joints in time of peace, and two in time of war
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints
And then I smoke two more
"Smoke cigarettes 'til the day she dies!"
"Toke a big spliff of some good sinsemillia"
"Smoke cigarettes 'til the day she dies!"
"Toke a big spliff of some good sinsemill..."
"Eazy-E were ya ever caught slippin'?" "Hell no!"

Daddy, he once told me, "Son, you be hard workin' man"
And Momma, she once told me, "Son, you do the best you can"
But then, one day, I met a man who came to me and said:
"Hard work good and hard work fine, but first take care of head"

Stolen from an Africa land
Chased out with a knife
With a face like Bob Marley
And a mouth like a motor bike

Oh well, the bars are always open
And the time is always right
And if God's good word goes unspoken
The music goes all night
And it goes:

If I were Bob Marley, I'd say "Could you be loved?"
And If I was Half Pint, or with my Lord, up above
If I was Mike Tyson, I would look for a fight
And If I was a Boomtown Rat, I would be staying up all night
If I was the king Ad-Rock, I would get stupid dumb
If rhymes were Valiums, I'd be comfortably numb
But if I had a shotgun, you know what I'd do
I'd point that shit straight at the sky
And shoot heaven on down for you

I want a lover, but I can't find the time
I want a reason, but I can't find the rhyme
And I want to start some static, but I can't afford
To get slammed to the ground like I fell off my skateboard, hey
Nowadays, as clear as you please:
Get strapped with protection, or strap with disease

Laughter, it's free
Any time, just call me:

When you're down with Sublime, you get
Funky fresh hits
You get nothing

Stolen from an Africa land
I was chased out of the bar
I saw my best friend tonight so
Don't push me too far

I'm gonna run, come down with the new lyrics
Get hip, get hip
Don't slip, you knuckle heads
Racism is schism, on a serious tip
You don’t believe me, then I g'won bust your lip
Higher the mountain, it hard to climb
Rougher the rhythm, then it must be Sublime
Listen Yellow Lover, yeah dem right on time
We got Cricket with the quickness and the bassline
Go and raid the sound, an' tell the people the news
Oh, hey
Tell them reggae music is on the loose
(Here I am, like a raging storm with a brand new style and a unique fashion)
(I am from the place where the sun keeps shinin', shinin')
And good, good vibes that keep on playing, playing
Dem a fire one shot for peace equality
Come, come, dem a come with a rougher stylee
Come, come, dey no care about your reggae stylee
Come, come, if ya come with your reggae style
Dem a fire one shot
Pump-pump, lick-a-shot

Fear who are launch, dem attack me wit they armor

Wait, hold up...

Got your hair permed
You've got your red dress on
Screaming that second gear was such a turn on
And the fog forming on my window
Tells me that the morning's here
And you'll be gone before too long
Who taught you those new tricks?
Damn, I shouldn't start that talk
But life is one big question when you're starin' at the clock
And the answer's always waiting at the liquor store
40 ounces to freedom
So I'll take that walk
And I know that

Oh, I'm not going back
Oh, not going back
Oh, God knows, not going back
Not going

And you look so fine
When you lie, it just don't show
But I know which way the wind blows
A 40 oz to freedom is the only chance I have
To feel good, even though I feel bad
And I know that

On the east side, that's where I met my Ramona
"I wanna go to a party", that's what she said
"Lonely, that's what I've been
Here's my telephone number, call me"
And to a party, a house party
All the bad people, just rally 'round me and love
She send the message of love

She said, "I love up the way you move
I love the way you rap", bump-bump
Ramona, please step back
Now she's my Ruca
I'm barely waiting for my jaina

She moved from Long Beach down to L.A
Right now, she's selling oranges by the freeway
I wanna know, Ramona am I the only one? Tell me

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
Had a drink about an hour ago
Sitting in the corner by herself, in a bar in downtown Hell
She heard a noise, and she looked through the door
And saw a man she'd never seen before
Light skin, light blue eyes
A double-chin and a plastic smile
Well, her heart raced as he walked in the door
And took an empty seat next to her at the bar
"My brand new car is parked right outside
How'd ya like to go for a ride?"
And she said, "Wait a minute, I have to think"
He said, "That's fine, may I please buy you a drink?"
One drink turned into three, or four
And they left and got into his car
And they drove away some place real far
"Now, babe, the time has come
How'd ya like to have a little fun?"
And she said, "If we could only please be on our way
I would not run"
That's when things got out of control

She didn't want to
He had his way
She said, "Let's Go"
He said, "No Way!"
"Come on, babe, it's your lucky day
Shut your mouth, we're gonna do it my way
Come on, baby, don't be afraid
If it wasn't for date rape, I'd never get laid"


He finished up and he started the car
He turned around and drove back to the bar
He said, "Now, baby, don't be sad
In my opinion, you weren't half-bad"
She picked up a rock, threw it at the car
Hit him in the head, now he's got a big scar
Come on, party people, won't you listen to me?
Date rape stylee
The next day, she went to her drawer
Looked up her local attorney at law
Went to the phone and filed a police report
And then she took the guy's ass to court
Well, the day he stood in front of the judge
He screamed, "She lies, that little slut!"
The judge knew he was full of shit
And he gave him twenty-five years
And now his heart is filled with tears
One night in jail, it was getting late
He was butt-raped by a large inmate, and he screamed
But the guards paid no attention to his cries
That's when things got out of control

The moral of the date rape story:
It does not pay to be drunk and horny

But that's the way it had to be
They locked him up and threw away the key
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind
Even though he now takes it in the behind
That's the way it had to be
They locked him up and threw away the key
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind
Even though he now takes it in the behind
Date rape!

She didn't want to
She didn't want to
She didn't want to
She didn't want to
Take it!

One...
Rollin', rollin, rollin
Keep those doggies rollin'
Rollin', rollin, rollin, rawhide
Well good for leather
Windy rain or weather
Wishing my girl was by my side
All the things I'm missin'
Good vittles, love, and kissin'
Are waiting at the end of my ride
Move 'em on, head 'em up
Head 'em up, move 'em on
Move 'em on, head 'em up

Ride 'em in, let 'em out

Part I: "54-46 (That's My Number)"

Do you believe I would take such a thing with me
And give it to a police man?
I wouldn't do that, I wouldn't do that
If I did that, would you say:
"Sir, come down and put the charge on me"?
I wouldn't do that, oh, I wouldn't do that
I'm not a fool to hurt myself
But I was innocent to what they done to me
They were wrong, they were wrong

Give it to me, one time (Ooh, give it to me, yeah)
Give it to me, two times
Give it to me, three times
Give it to me, four times

Oh, 54-46 was my number, what's my number now?
Right now, somebody else has that number
One more time
54-47 was my number, what's my number now?
Right now, somebody else has that number
Say, Boops say, one go with him up, yes
Say, Boops say, want keep him, keep him on him back, sing!
Say, Boops say, me want to take off her dress, huh
Say, Boops say, I've kissed and caressed
Cause we're jillin' it and we're chillin' it into the club all night
We're jillin' it and we're chillin' it into the club all night, boys
Hearin' the dog, feeling the beat, in the dog pound
D.J., "Lord have his grilled cheese"
'Cause some jealous punk
Snuck up around the back
Tried to take the lovin' over me
Lord, I got into a fist fight
And wound up in jail all night

Ah, give it to me one time (Ooh yes, mmm, my pussy)
Give it to me two times
Give it to me three time
Give it to me four time
Part II:  Ball and Chain

People, listen up, don't stand too near
I've got something that you all should hear
All lies, all the lies they told to me
Form a little part of history
I was always taught that boy meets girl
Fall in love, get married and forget the world
Nine months later, a sweet baby's on the way
Kiss him on the cheek, and life's okay
I don't feel no pain
I don't have no time
To listen to conflicting points of view

It's a crazy world to live alone
A ball and chain I call my own
Ba-na-na-na-na

People, listen up, don't stand too close
I've got something that you all should know
Holy Matrimony's not for me
Rather die alone in misery
'Cause I was always taught that boy meets girl
Fall in love, get married and forget the world
Nine months later, a sweet baby's on the way
Isn't that what they used to say?

When the girl you knew
And the bonds that we grew
Turned into a ball and chain

I step into the great unknown
On a ball and chain I call my own
Ba-na-na-na-na
A crazy world to live alone

When a girl you knew
And the bonds that we grew
Turned into a ball and chain

I step into the great unknown
On a ball and chain I call my own

Because marriage doesn't work in the world today
It's an institution that is in decay
And if I have love I wish to portray
I will surely find another way
Because I was always taught that boy meets girl
Fall in love, get married and forget the world
Nine months later, the sweet baby's on the way
Kiss him on the cheek and life's okay

I don't feel no pain
I don't have no time
To listen to conflicting points of view

I step into the great unknown
On a ball and chain I call my own

As I was walking down rubadub square
Not a chill to the weather but a nip to the air
From another direction she was caught in my eye
It could be an illusion, but I might as well try
Might as well try

She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away, she was not like other girls
(Like other girls)

Well, I ain't never been right, as I ain't never been wrong
It seldom works out the way it does in this song
(Hey)
'Cause once in a while you get shown in the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right

It was the summer of love, and I thank the stars above
Because the woman took the lovin' over me
And just to gain her trust, I bought a microbus
Because I sold up all my personal property
A tight tie-dyed dress, she was a psychedelic mess
We toured to the north, south, east and west
We sold some mushroom tea
We sold some ecstasy
We sold nitrous, opium, acid, heroin and PCP
And now I hear the police coming after me
Yes, now I hear the police coming after me
The one Scarlet, with the flowers in her hair
She's got the police coming after me
Well, there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
All scarlet begonias and a touch of the blues
And there ain't nothin' wrong with the love that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way just to let her pass by
Let her pass by
Oh, just to let her pass by4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

No me importa que se lleva, porque todo se quitará
Ay, no puedo verlo, ni en pintura
Cuando empecemos, no me dio cuenta
De que luego, tuviera que pagar
Pero si se cambie, me voy a acostarme con ti, con ti

No me propongo predicar, vive y deja vivir
Pero el amigo es un condón en el bolsillo
Yo no soy medico, no soy chapucero
Solamente soy pobre, y ya estoy tan solo
Pero si se cambie, ella sería mía
Para ser poseído en propiedad, en propiedad


I've got to get it off with you, woah, what can I do?
I would lay down anytime with her, with her5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I swear sometimes you're taking me for granted
I swear sometimes you're a whore
I swear, but I know there ain't no reason
'Cause everything is such a bore

Last night I had a dream, though it made me sick
Saw you in your bedroom sucking someone else's dick
(My goodness!)
My friends all laughed, said it was my fault
Said it's time that it happened to me
But I know that the show was much more than a blow
So I'm waiting for the tide to get low
I'm waiting for the tide to get low
"Damn... Now lick my balls."
"The rhythm, the rebel."
"The rhythm, the rebel."
"Shit I said suck the mothafucka, you're bitin' it, shit!"

If I was an ant crawlin' upon the wall
Tell me, baby, would it make no difference, at all?
If I was a roach on a tree, tell me, would you smoke me?
Bright lights put me in a trance
But it ain't house music
Makes me want to dance
(Word)
I don't gamble, but I bet
I'm gonna die if I don't get a cigarette
Just because I always play the mack
With a monkey on my back
"Let's go get stoned"
"KICK IT!"5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Go!
And I won't give it up to you
And I feel love, feel love, love, love

Jailhouse gets empty
Rudy gets plenty
The baton stick gets shorter
Rudy gets taller

'Em fight against the youth
'Cause we're strong
Them are rude, rude people
Can't fight against the youth
'Cause we're strong
'Em are rude, rude people

Now, when I was a youth in 1983
It was the best day of my life
Had the 89 vision
We didn't fuss or no fight
When all the little daughters wanna be my wife
A vision
It was playin' on my guitar, on my guitar
I had to be there
I had to be there
I had to be there
I had to be there
And the rhythm playin'
I know that I'm gonna be there, yeah
Bud Gaugh will be singing there
And Eric Wilson will be bangin' out there, yeah
And we'll be all singin', with version, with version
Reggae version, version, version, version, oh
What has been told to the wise and up-rooted?
It's gonna be revealed unto you babes, and Sublime
Rudy, Rudy, Rudy

Can't fight against the youth
Right now, them are rude, rude people
Can't fight against the resistance
Oh, right now, 'em are rude, rude people
We gonna rule this land among children
We gonna rule this land

'Cause when that rhythm, it was playin' on my guitar
On my guitar
I had to be there
I had to be there
I had to be there
I had to be there
Oh, when I was a youth, it was the best day
It was the best day of my life
We had the 89' vision
We didn't fuss or no fight
When all the little daughters wanna be my wife
When that rhythm, it was playin on my guitar
On my guitar
I had to be there
I had to be there
I had to be there
I had to be there
I had to be there
Had to be there

Jailhouse gets empty
And Rudy gets plenty
Baton stick gets shorter
Rudy gets taller, taller

'Em fight against the youth
'Cause we're strong
Them are rude, rude people
Can't fight against the youth4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Down in Mississippi, where the sun beats down from the sky
They give it up, and they give it up, and they give it up
But they never ask why
Daddy was a rollin', rollin' stone
He rolled away one day and he never came home

It ain't hard to understand
This ain't Hitler's master plan
What it takes to be a man
In my mind, in my brain
I roll it over like a steamin' freight train
It ain't hard to ascertain

You only see what you want to believe
When you light up in the back with those tricks up your sleeve
That don't mean I can't hang
Day that I die will be the day that I
Shut my mouth and put down my guitar
Sunday morning, hold church down at the bar
Get down on your knees and start to pray, oh
Pray my itchy rash will go away, ow

Back up y'all, it ain't me
Kentucky Fried Chicken is all I see
It's a hellified way to start your day
If I make you cry all night
Me and daddy gonna have a fist fight
It ain't personal, it ain't me
I only hear what you told me to be
I'm a backward-ass hillbilly, I'm Dick Butkus
You know I lie, I get mean
I'm a thief in the dark, I'm a ragin' machine
I'm a triple-rectified ass son of a bitch
Rec-tite on my ass and it makes me itch
I can see for miles, and miles, and miles, oh
My broken heart makes me smile

In my mind, in my brain
I go back, I go completely insane
It ain't personal, it ain't me
If I make you cry, I might
Be your daddy at the end of the night
Take a load from my big gun

You only see what you want to believe
When you creep from the back
I got tricks up my sleeve
24/7, devil's best friend
Makes no difference, it's all the same in the end4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
