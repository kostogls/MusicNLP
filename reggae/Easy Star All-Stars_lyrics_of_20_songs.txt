Nothing to do to save his life
Call his wife in
Nothing to say but "What a day!"
"How's your boy been?"
Nothing to do
It's up to you
I've got nothing to say but "It's okay"
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Going to work
Don't want to go
Feeling low down
Heading for home
You start to roam
Then you're in town
Everybody knows
There's nothing doing
Everything is closed
It's like a ruin
Everyone you see
Is half asleep
And you're on your own
You're in the street
After a while you start to smile
Now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk
By the old school
Nothing has changed
It's still the same
I've got nothing to say but "It's okay"
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
People running 'round
It's five o'clock
Everywhere in town
Is getting dark
Everyone you see
Is full of life
It's time for tea
And Meet the Wife
Somebody needs to know the time
Glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt
Now you're in gear
Go to a show
You hope she goes
I've got nothing to say but "It's okay"

Money, get away
Get a good job with good pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team
Money, get back
I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first class traveling set
And I think I need a Lear jet

Money will make a good man bad, yah yah
Money will make 'nuff man bad, yah yah
Money will make bredren and bredren go to war
Forget about the good times
Don't bodda let it change your ways
If you no careful it will make you lose your mind, yas!
If you worship it, destined fi a fall
Very addictive, watch, be selective
Nuh bodda sell ya soul, just fear de money
When Jah Jah come, ain't nuttin' funny
Cyan't pay yuh way inna Mount Zion
Not if yah have not 'nuff love inna all ya heart my frien', yah yas!
Nevah remember when dem used to beg a dollah
Nevah remember when dem used to dead fi hungah
Now dat dem get rich, dem gwan like big timah
Burn down de bridge dat dem cross ovah
Bwoy ya cyan rich today, and broke tomorruh
Don't you know dat's the way life go? Yes!
Money a money and friend a friend
Mi a not put no money before my bredren
Dem a rush in and a kill fi de dollah
Fi de love of money man a kill 'im owna brodda
Powah is money, money is powah
Materialistically dem get cankah
It a the root of all evil
Ghetto youth, alla man - be a beggah no!
Don't bodda mix up inna de bwoy dem suttin'
Boy if want trouble will get it, 'pon de double
'Pon de paypah chase, boy na watch no face
When every lickle 'ting dem want fi done de place
Man a defend faith in dollah and cents, yah
No bodda play wit' yuh life, yah mi friend!
Well well well - well...
Money will make a good man bad - yah yah yah yas
Money will make 'nuff man bad - yah yah yah yas
Money!
Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise it's no surprise that they're
Giving none away
"HuHuh! I was in the right!"
"Yes, absolutely in the right!"
"I certainly was in the right!"
"You was definitely in the right. That geezer was cruising for abruising!"
"Yeah!"
"Why does anyone do anything?"
"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!"
"I was just telling him, he couldn't get into number 2. He was asking
Why he wasn't coming up on freely, after I was yelling and
Screaming and telling him why he wasn't coming up on freely
It came as a heavy blow, but we sorted the matter out"EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(Time is the master, and time could be a disaster!)

Ticking away, the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
(Time is the master, and time could be a disaster!)
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
(Drop it, drop it, moving on the down)
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
(Ain't no time to play!)
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain (wow!)
You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today (ain't no time to play!)
And then one day you find, ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run (got no one to blame but yourself), you missed the starting gun

A-tick-a-tick-a-tock, look at the clock
Got to move it on the dot, and don't you know because the time is
The time, the time, the time, the time is the master
And time can be a disaster, yeah you know
Got no time to play
The time is the master, huh
And time is the master, yeah
I say you can't change the hands of time
And you could never turn back hands of time
Got no time to play
Got to get on the go and got to move it, right away when I tell you, say we got no time to be late
When I tell you, say whaa
'Cause time is the master
A tick-a-tick-a-tock-a move it on the dot and don't you look back, I tell you you could die
See the time, it's a terrible time
'Cause homie say can me say see what's time, yo
Yeah, you know?
Got to know what you understand, is what I want you to say, ain't got no time for me, got no time for delay is what I want you to say
A tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tock, move it on and say a-you could never stop
Got no time to play, I say no time to delay
Move it right away, I never tell you, don't wanna say 'cause this-a time is the master
Time is the master, time can be a disaster, yeah you know?
So you got to move it on the go and don't undertand, a little bit or a load, keep a-coming man go
When I tell you understand what I leave behind, leave for man, suppose I wanna go, she want you to say whaa!
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Transport, motorways and tram lines
Starting and then stopping, taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings, disappointed people, clinging on
To bottles 'cause when it comes it's so, so, so disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
I say let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing, wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental, don't, it always ends up drivel
One day, one day, I am gonna, I am gonna grow wings, a chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless, hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
I say let down and hanging around
Let down and hanging, let down and hanging, let down and hanging
You know, you know where you are with, you know where you are with
Floor collapsing, falling, bouncing back
One day, one day, I am gonna grow wings, it's a chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
I say let down and hanging around
Crushed, crushed like a bug in the ground

"(knock, knock, knock, knock, known) Open up the door, this is the Police
Ooohooohoooh-oooooh yeah, I want one likkle draw, (one likkle draw) one likkle draw
One likkle draw from my chalice
Is all that I want, before you take my herbs from me
Oh Mr. Officer
One likkle draw from my chalice
Is all that I need, before you take my herbs from me
Oh Mr. Officer
Now, man to man, I mean no disrespect
I know you're trying to earn your cheque
But I'm not a criminal suspect
I just want to get high
I grow my ganja in my own backyard
No blood was shed, nobody come to harm
Just a farmer with a likkle farm
Just trying to get by so give me...

Oh Mr. Officer

Why don't you come inside?
I can light up your fire
We can reason side-by-side
I think you know the truth about the 'erbs;
That they are a gift from Jah
Laws of man are just a bunch of words
So you have to take it easy star (easy now star)
I won't tell your captain or your supervisor
If you come back later you'll see a commissioner
He's my numero uno preferred customer
So why not give it a try?
You should take...
One likkle draw from my chalice
Is all that you'll need, before you take my herbs from me
Oh Mr. Officer
A one likkle draw from my chalice
Is all that you'll need, before you take my herbs from me
Oh Mr. Officer
Listen to me...
The truth is that I never even tried this
Never thought I was behind this
Always thought that it would lead to badness
Reefer smoke with you I might regret it
I swore that all this time I would uphold it
I seen a lot of badman and dem sold it
But on the other hand I cannot fight this
If God put it on the Earth it must be harmless
So give me one likkle draw from the chalice
Is all that I want, before I take your herbs from you
Oh Mr. Ganja farmer (yeah)
So give me one likkle draw from the chalice (yeah)
It's all that I need, before I take your herbs from you (yeah)

Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today, we escape
We escape
Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose
Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone
Sing us a song (Sing us a song)
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill
Such a chill
You can laugh
A spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you chokeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around and choose your own ground
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
All you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be
Run, rabbit run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
When at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
Balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early graveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Us, and them
And after all we're only ordinary men
Me, and you
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do
Forward he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
And the general sat and the lines on the map
Moved from side to side
Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up and down
But in the end it's only round and round
Haven't you heard it's a battle of words
The poster bearer cried
Listen son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside
"I mean, they're not gunna kill ya, so if you give 'em a quickshort
Sharp, shock, they won't do it again. Dig it? I mean he get off
Lightly, 'cos I would've given him a thrashing - I only hit himonce!
It was only a difference of opinion, but really...I mean goodmanners
Don't cost nothing do they, eh?"
Down and out
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about
With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way, it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For the want of the price of tea and a slice
The old man diedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

A patient better driver
A safer car
(baby smiling in back seat)
Sleeping well
(no bad dreams)
No paranoia
Careful to all animals
(never washing spiders down the plughole)
Keep in contact with old friends
(enjoy a drink now and then)

Charity standing orders
On Sundays ring road supermarket

Now self-employed
Concerned (but powerless)
An empowered and informed member of society
(pragmatism not idealism)
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet
(shot of baby strapped in back seat)
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic like a cat tied to a stick
That's driven into frozen winter shit
(the ability to laugh at weakness)
Calm
Fitter
Healthier and more productive
A pig in a cage on antibiotics

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of red, gold and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking-glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path
The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paper boy brings more
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon
The lunatic is in my head
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You re-arrange me 'till I'm sane
You lock the door
And throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me
And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart
The girl is mine

Paroles de la chanson Unbelievable (Feat. Cas Haley) :
Its unbelievable
The way that youre loving me
Never in my life have I felt
So satisfied with what Ive been dealt
Now its inconceivable
That you would ever leave
Im putting all my faith in you to
Carry on and see this through
Ive got my mind made up
Im gonna love you forever
Ive got my mind made up
Im gonna love you forever, forever
You gave me loving when I wasnt doing right by you
You kept it coming when I didnt seem to have a clue
You made me feel so good inside
My love for you cant be denied
You helped me see that I was missing out on happiness
You eased me up when I was falling in a pool of stress
And now I see your love is bona fide
So I will stick right by your side
Ive got my mind made up
Im gonna love you forever
Ive got my mind made up
Im gonna love you forever, forever
It unbelievable
The way that you make me feel
Never in my life have I dreamed
Love could be as good as it seems with you
You made me redeemable
When no one else could really see
So now I make this vow to you
I am gonna see this through
Ive got my mind made up
Im gonna love you forever
Ive got my mind made up
Im gonna love you forever, forever
Its unbelievable
Girl Im gonna make you believe
Its unbelievable
Cause I like what you do to me
Its unbelievable
You better start keeping the faith
Its unbelievable
Cause your love is too precious to waste
Ive got my, my mind made up
Im gonna love you forever
Ive got my, my mind made up
Im gonna love you forever
Ive got my, my mind made up
Im gonna love you forever
Ive got my, my mind made up
Im gonna love you forever
Ive got my, my mind made up
Im gonna love you forever
