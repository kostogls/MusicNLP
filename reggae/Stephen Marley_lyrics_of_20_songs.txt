We are soldiers in Jah army
We are soldiers in Jah army

Only the King of Kings can sit down 'pon throne
And chase the crazy bumpheads from out of the town
And take on Babylon them evil boys pound for pound
Without even blemishing his royal gown
Inspire I with clever adjectives and pronoun
To influence da'yout dem with word power and sound
Well a build you house pon sand well if must fall down

Not even one but several of the thing me bust a federal
Issused by the rasta general
Enemies a meet them funeral

There is warfare in a physical and
Warfare in a spirtual
There is warfare in a digital, and
Warfare in a chemical

But Gong did run come warn me
Say take it calmly
Look how long the boy them a swarm me
Easy Gargamel easy man...

Rock Stone, was my pillow

Hear the man say...
R-R-Rock stone was my pillow could not find place fi sleep
Pot dem empty we haffi find food fi eat
Everyday we terrorize by soldier and police
When the thing dem a drum and di thing dem a beat
From dem a play cowboy, and Indian, and Chief
From the first, to the third, straight up to seven street
One thing in a wi mind a fi trample di beast
And make it in a life, and inherit as the meek
Better the stone dem deh yah
Self employed, cannot get lay off
Mount a work mi have
Can't even get a day off
Who did waan fi stop mi now dem find out seh dem way off
Alright, and mi seh one by one, one by one
One by one, wi stepping out a babylon
Then one by one, one by one
Hail King Selassie the conquering lion
Rock Stone was my pillow

Help us Jah
Take us from the slum
Never give up no matter what, strictly fiyah burn
Hail Rasta, take us from the slum
Never give up matter what
King Selassie I blessing come
Sufferation is thing could be no harder time
Got to widen your views, got to broaden your mind
What we face in the ghetto, nowhere else can you find
Hunger, Poverty, a system so unkind
As a matter a fact, there is an after shock
When cold ground was my bed and my pillow was a rock
Try to make it through the system all the doors were lock
Yet nothing beats a try so I ain’t go stop
Mount a time they write a book on you
A set amount ah crap they'd ah put on you
Yet when yuh in the dirt they wouldn’t look on you
They would only scorn and wanna wipe the foot on yuh
But, see yah
So open up, Zion door
Ethiopia, Africa for sure
Liberate the poor, the poor, hey
Mi nah lie, true mi hail Selassie I dem wah fi war I
Read mi bible turn to peace and praise Tafari
Good bye Babylon goodbye, goodbye
Open up, zion door

Children of Israel, children of Israel
Hey!

Ribs and mi chest, mi spine and mi back
Wait til you hear, when dis riddim drop
Head yuh toe, yuh body a rock, from me pon di mic

The peaceful, righteous, Rastaman
Rod of correction, inna him hand
Preachin' out to man and woman, give riches to King Solomon
Now, bass come out, and treble a top
Cap an no buck, an nuh buck a no cap
Sweetest singer, was Sugar Minott
Man a come in and ah give me a shot

When him see sun, him cyah take dat
Eyes dem dark, fi use contact

Fi mi head dread, me head it no plat
Nuh fraid ah no mouse, nuh fraid ah no rat
Pray to Jah, me never will stop

Live in a house, no live in a flat
Up inna Zion, di righteious will top
Jah blow breeze, the devil cannot

I've been gone awhile away from you
And I hope you overstand
That I've got to do what I must do to be a better man
Cause if I was just to act a fool do nothing with myself
Then all my blessings would be cursed my world would crumble in
It's a joy when I sit down and think of the good times that we have
And what we do to make it through when the good turns to the bad
Well I hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't fuss because I must go do what I must do

Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains

A time, a space, a different place, how perfect we might be
I would be the wind that blows you'd be that willow tree
And I could never bare the thought of you not by my side
So I would be the warmth of day you'd be the cool of night
And everyday I pray to Jah that one day you will see
And overstand the fact I must fulfill my destiny
I hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't cry you know I must do what I must do
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains
 (Mos Def)
Well and it's not easy, Jah knows how I try I try
So don't you get weary (Oh God)
Jah knows how I try, I try

And God knows, that life is one big road
With a lot of signs and turns and twist and curves
Even though the road is rocky
But maintain to ride and keep on rockin
From, city to city backyard to yard
And we, be seein the sites standin under the lights
And the spot is hot it's cold and lonely at nights
And I'm feenin and I'm dreamin and I'm holdin you tight
But hold on, every single road I rode on
Come to an end and I'm back home again
So baby please don't cry
It's no valley low and it's no mountain high
And our love don't die with the passage of time
It just grow more, it just keep strong
And even though I'm gone I ain't never too far
Your the light through the dark shining right through my heart
So my journey must start
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains

And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Though the wicked persecute I, still my heart has love
Oh, my head's anointed with the powers of love
Though the wicked persecute I, with envy and grudge
Oh my head's anointed Hey!
There's no room for mistakes, we're sailing a tight ship ashore
Get a broom sweep the place, oh clear a space (x2)
There's no room for mistakes mama said, sailing a tight ship ashore
Get the broom sweep the place, oh clear a space, Yeah!
Though the wicked persecute I, still my heart has love
Oh, my head's anointed with the powers of love
Though them wicked persecute I, with envy and grudge
But my head's anointed Hey!
There's no room for mistakes, we're sailing a tight ship ashore
Get a broom sweep the place, oh clear a space
There's no room for mistakes papa said, sailing a tight ship ashore
Get the broom sweep the place, oh clear a space, Yeah!
Let's get this ship up in spic and spanking, yes
All hands on deck I said, don't let me say it again (x2)

BOOM!
From we a little boy them used to grudge we
Fi we horlicks
Nuff a dem no hold no joy dem full bare envy and malice
Nuff a dem a get bad mind and saying "those arrogant Marleys"
Them say who Jah bless , no man curse, Babylon is harmless
Alright now nuff a dem hard at work , them watching who's working the hardest
Grass hopper jump at anything that scruffle in the grasses
Lion dem never yet grudge the other creatures of the forest
What you reap is what you sow , don't be surprised when we a harvest...
My pocket so fat is it a walrus in my wallet?
True say no man perfect but our flows are always flawless
One room at a time in a shack or in a palace
Cleanliness is godliness so keep it clean regardless
(need help from here down)
When from  filthiness and garbage
Walk the plank if they full life was honest
Aboard this ship is heading to the land of promise

Scholars and scientists now conceive that Africa is the first place of mankind
Africans were the first builders of civilization
They discovered mathematics, invented writing, developed sciences
Engineering, medicine, religion, fine arts, and built the Great Pyramids
An architectural achievement which still baffles modern scientists'

The 225th Emperor direct descent from Solomon and The Queen of Sheba
He is the "King of Kings, The Lion of Judah"
The name Haile Selassie I means "Power of the Trinity"

Educate yourselves, of Africa
To liberate yourself, Africa
Keep your heads up high
No more will we cry
Eeeeyh
Our history that they stole, Africa
Is written in our souls, Africa
Oldest nation on this earth
Know just what you worth
Well well
Ships that sail to distant places
Robbed us of our rights and worth
History says that you've betrayed us
Talking of the Gods you serve
Hear the rambling in the sky
Tears that our forefathers cry
And today we're still in chains
Take the shackle from our minds
You're the cornerstone
The king upon the throne
How beautiful are thou, Africa
All nation have to bow, Africa
Don't you fall from grace
You're that secret place
Aye! Aye-ah-aye!
Power to the people, Motherland representa
I'm on trial with the man she my co-defendant
And I demand her attention, can you focus women?
I'm getting closer to the sky errytime I hit it
Haile Selassie I, "Power of the Trinity"
Soul made in naija, my vice made in Italy
White mans world that I'm livin' in, some say
But it was Africa the continent we all came from
Can't nothing come between me and you
So before I have seeds gotta understand my roots
Gotta understand the truth. We is all king's 'round here
Life's not all fair, work till we fall dead
Paul goin' hard 'till I urn like a Pall-Bearer
Although my body's in the U.S my heart's there
I can never be ashamed of her
I got my features and my name from her; mama Africa

The richest place on earth
Know just what your worth

Talking about the God you serve
Keep your heads up high
No more will we cry
They infiltrate our homes, Africa
They claim it as their own, Africa
Now we must stand tall
To break down all these wall-alls
Well well
Our children must be taught, of Africa
The science and the art, Africa
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah Nahhh!
Educate yourself, Africa
To liberate yourselves, Africa
Keep your heads up high
No more will we cry
Beautiful are thou, Africa
A legend have to bow, Africa
Oh Oh!
Made in Africa, We share Africa (We share Africa)

Which way from here
I'm caught up in the pages of my mind
And it's not so clear
But it seems the hurt is way too much this time
Cause I see a vain look in your eyes
Tell me, do you see the same, same look in mine

Sandpapper kisses, papercut bliss
Don't know what this is, but it all leads to this
You're gonna leave, her
You have deceived, her
Ooh just a girl

Now here I go again
She said I'll break her heart again
She plays the fool again
She said I'll break the rules again
Though I disagree
She thinks she knows me more than me
It's so hard to see
What this voice keeps telling me

Ooh just a girl with featherweight curls
To expose all she knows you play like tease
Just a Girl with featherweight curls
To expose all she knows you play like tease
You're gonna leave, her
You have decieved, her
Ooh just a girl1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The revolutionaries...
Ya know? (Ya know...)

Look at the scars on my feet, from this road I travel
But I'm seeing change gradual, I went from an apartment to a castle
Gravel on my feet, you see I took a lot of losses
Grindin' no matter what the cause is, I got a vision so flawless

Gained lot of scars walking on this road
Had my share of problems, only God knows
I came from kicking doors to a million records sold
I'm a platinum artist but my wrist gold
Rather it's my freedom than to live broke
Still top swinging in this black Ghost
Tell the dealer give me mounts with no mirrors
Only looking forward, what I gotta look back for?
Cause the past 20/20 when it hindsight
Can't see these  in my blind side
Only smoke the best to keep my mind right
Cause  can get sour when you're in the limelight
Used to be apartments now I'm sleeping in a mansion
Now I'm doing shows, baby dropping out them panties
Got it on my own, never had nothing handed
If you ain't come from where I come from, then you wouldn't understand it (Flocka)
Ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya (2x)

But I'm seeing change gradual, I went from an apartment to a castle

Grindin' no matter what the cause is, I got a vision so flawless

I done been through the headaches and the hassles
But only God can judge me with the gavel
They say I can't rap but I can make millions
So I don't care for your opinions, I ain't asked you
I'm from south side Clayco got a tattoo
I'm a street  did what I had to
So we had to war, yeah I dabbled
Coming up wasn't easy did it gradual
Bullet scars on my body had to battle
For my life, guess this karma coming back for me
For the dirt that I did, for this fast money
Just counting callouses feet from the travel
Bounce back, what ain't kill me made me stronger
Live for today cause tomorrow never promised
Just a couple years ago we was broke (broke)
Now my bank account full of commas
(Flocka, Flocka, Flocka, Flocka, Flame)
Ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya (2x)

Look at the scars on my feet, from this road I travel (you know)
But I'm seeing change gradual (you know), I went from an apartment to a castle (urgh)

Turn 'em up
Get them ready
King sincerely (?)
Get them ready now...ready now...
She's a pretty little thing

It's time for us to get closer now
Wanna feel your touch
Wanna hear your sound
Every time I see, see your face
You paint the perfect picture
Every time I'm with ya

Oh you and I, a world apart
Please let me know, if I have your heart
Cause every time I'm with ya
You paint the perfect picture

This relationship, society can't relate
They say we're two opposite
They say it's all a mistake
They say I'm no good for you
They say you're too good for me
Dem said our puzzle don't fit
Well baby I disagree
Your mama told you to be
A very good behaving
And now just because of me
They say you're miss behaving
Dad is not talking to you
Because he doesn't approve
My lies no truth, my truth no lie
Oh Jah is here so I must abide
Oh you and I, a world apart
But every time I'm with ya
We paint the perfect picture
Please let me know, if I have your heart
We'll share the pains, oh we'll share the joy
'Cause every time I'm with ya
We paint the perfect picture

She said they taught her to love
And now they want her to hate
They say they're kicking her out
She told them she'll be okay
As long as she's loving me
She told them she'll be alright
She's so ready to live
She's excited for life
Is she reckless at heart
'Cause she won't leave me alone
She's always in my thoughts
I got her face on my phone
Picture's as perfect can be
Every time she's with me
It's time for us to get closer now
I'm gonna feel your touch
I'm gonna hear your sound
Every time I see, see your face
You paint the perfect picture
Every time I'm with ya

Oh you and I, a world apart
Please let me know if I have your heart
You paint the perfect picture
Every time I'm with ya

Well baby it's you and me
We're painting portraits of love
Why won't they let us be free
And just let God be the judge
They've never been so ashamed
We've never been so in love
I'd rather hold on to you
They'd rather hold on to grudge
It's always been we and them
It's always been you and I
They taught us live and let live
They'd rather live and let die
I pray they live to forgive
And I say baby don't cry.......
'Cause when it's all said and done
And man a shed flesh and bone
They won't care who was wrong
They would wish you were home
It's reminding me of a little story I know
It's like Ali and Marley
Or maybe Leah alone.. (?)
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, I adore you...
You're pretty like a picture with love
You're my Mona Lisa
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, I adore you...
You always paint the perfect picture with love
You're my Mona Lisa
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, I adore you...
You always paint the perfect picture with love
You're my Mona Lisa... you're my Mona Lisa...
You're my Mona Lisa.......picture with love

We come from so far, and life is full of surprises
Just know I'll never change, no i’ll never change
No matter the circumstances, though this road can be demanding
I’ll always be the same, always be the same
Never lose sight of who you are, temptation comes from near and far
Wounds heal but leave a scar
Make sure from the start, its from your heart

Because didn’t you know, that the higher you go
It’s the more you'll expose, if you’re a thorn or a rose
Because didn’t you know, that the higher you go
It’s the more you'll expose, if you’re a thorn or a rose

Yo
We're all products of the same stem, same blood, and same skin
Same ghetto flower growing from the same pavement
Rising to the challenge of this world and trying to stay in it
Paying tears and sweat, paying dues and paying rent
Never shall I stumble I stay on the same wavelength
Yeah the game is savage yo it’s primitive its cavemen
Only way to save men and free them from enslavement
Start to over stand each other like a native language
Guiding one another down this road full of changes
Although its full of dangers we got to be courageous
Let the vibes spread and make your bravery contagious
Know you’re going through the same book but different pages
People can be so vain, hustling can be so pain-ful
And make you feel like all you do is work for no gain
But before it bottles up the flames like propane
Inhale and exhale, no stress and no strain

Life, tomorrow ain't promised, ain't that the truth?
I can see the shooters on the roof
I can hear the prayers in the gunning
D-D-DJ Khaled

Everybody feels the pains of life
Yes we work so hard to strive
Spending day and night tryna make it right
Create a better life
Come let's take a ride
Let music free your mind

So tonight we gon' have a good time
Yes tonight, we gon' celebrate life
Oh tonight, we gon' have a party
Yes tonight, everyone is right
If even just tonight

No Appleton fi find, enjoy the fruits of your labor
Dance up inna the street like Trinidad and Jamaica
Tun up di music loud mek we disturb we neighbor
In it for the love, Jah mek we done out the paper
B-b-back it up, cah anuh size we fraid of
Big, you cudda small or taller than a skyscraper
Always inna di oven for you know seh man a baker
Flex like my daddy but me have me mother flavor
Sen fi Jah army mek wi lock down di acre
Bring me the kette, an di Congo shaker
Give me the makavara mek di chalwa start blaze up
Imma midnight raver
So tonight we gon' have a good time
Yes tonight, we gon' celebrate life
Oh tonight, we gon' have a party
Yes tonight, everyone is right
If even just tonight

We just tryna live while the night's young
Too focused on the right now to worry 'bout what might come
All the stressing lately got me thinking I should light some
All that playing baby, light one
Busy Iggy, pretty girl stacking up pretty pennies
Save this chitter-chatter, ain't never mattered
It don't offend me
Say they shocked I bring this money with me, then take over cities
Turn a hard-top to a soft-top, had a re-do for them titties
Every eye on my hip and waistline, watch me whine
And they must have forgotten about me baby, let me remind dem
Everyone's a critic nowadays, never mind dem
We bring the stars out and realign dem

So tonight we gon' have a good time
Yes tonight, we gon' celebrate life
Oh tonight, we gon' have a party
Yes tonight, everyone is right
If even just tonight
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
I'm getting kush, taking shots, get it started
They like, "Did you hear that song with Flocka and Stephen Marley?"
I'm doing donuts in the parking lot in my Ferrari
I love my people, I do this for my people
See the evil, why we need to be illegal?
And hella reefer, fall asleep, and wake up to the reaper
Take a leap of faith, lose the hate and love your people
I make beats and smoking doobies chillin' in Jamaica
Cross me and I'mma introduce you to your maker
I can't hear these suckers scheming, I know they some haters
You can copy the machine or make the paper
Or you could be original, reach pinnacles
Alcohol and kush, that's my vitamins and minerals
Chilling with my girl, skinny dipping in the swimming pool
I do it to the maximum, you keep it to the minimum
(Flocka, Flocka)

So tonight we gon' have a good time
Yes tonight, we gon' celebrate life
Oh tonight, we gon' have a party
Yes tonight, everyone is right
If even just tonight1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yow! (Ghetto)
They do more to the people, than for the people (Get out, Get it)
They crash the economy like a vehicle (Let's set it, I heard dem)
Seh dem a don and dem a dupes and dem a dadda (Stupid fools)
Inna the heart of the youths dem future yuh stick a dagger (That's what they did)
Let's do this ragga (Let's move)

Once I was a little child
Little things that make me smile
But quickly I became a man
The don put a gun into my hand
Told me that I could live or die
I didn't know the reason why
But my gun became my toy
The story of the ghetto boy
Ghetto boy, ghetto boy
The story of the ghetto boy
Ghetto boy, ghetto boy
The story of the ghetto boy

Well, di story of a ghetto boy
Who di don give di gun an tink him get a toy
So him deploy inna di street to set a better joy
But now him buck up di police and him regret a choice Death is what him get a tise
Story of a ghetto yute
Who the don give the gun and seh yuh better shoot
If yuh want to wear a better suit yuh want fi drive a coupe
Wear a couple gold chain and sleep with couple prostitute
Dem future yuh a prosecute
No don cyah tell I nutten or press I button
Mi a gwaan eat mi greens if mi cyah buy mutton
Mi nuh red eye or glutton fi no gyal or guy somn
No hold di fate so till the gate Jah seh fi I must open
We nuh waan see Andrew Holness, we nuh waan see Portia
NCB mi waan fi see and Scotia
Tell P and JP, both a dem a joker
But me proud a ghetto mi come outta
Once I was a little child
Little things that make me smile
But quickly I became a man
The don put a gun into my hand
Told me that I could live or die
I didn't know the reason why
But my gun became my toy
The story of the ghetto boy
Ghetto boy, ghetto boy
The story of the ghetto boy
Ghetto boy, ghetto boy

Mi tell dem, ghetto we ghetto we nuh change we ways Yuh violate man an a grades a blaze
Anywhere the food deh man ago go for

Suppose mi tell yuh seh we go fi food anyweh

Menace to society the world seh a we dat

I've been gone awhile away from you
And I hope you overstand
That I've got to do what I must do
To be a better man
Cause if I was to just to act a fool
Do nothing with myself
Then all my blessings would be cursed
My world would crumble in
It's a joy when I sit down and
Think of the good times that we have
And what we do to make it through
When the good turns in to the bad
Well I hope you'll find it in your heart
And know these words are true
And please don't fuss
Because I must go do what I must do
(Chorus)
Hey baby don't you worry
Even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
Cause if you thought that I was lost
I had to bare my cross
Now I'm free from all these Chains
A time, a space, a different place
How perfect we might be
I would be the wind that blows
You'd be that Willow tree
And I could never bare the thought of you not by my side
So I would be the warmth of day
You'd be the cool of night
And everyday I pray to Jah that one day you will see
And overstand the fact I must fulfill my destiny
I hope you'll find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't cry
Cause you know that I must do what I must do
(Chorus)
Hey baby don't you worry
Even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
Cause if you thought that I was lost
I had to bare my cross
Now I'm free from all these Chains
Well and it's not easy
Jah knows how I try, I try
So don't you get irie
Jah knows how I try, I try

And God knows, that life is one big road
With alot of signs and turns and twist and curves
Even though the road is rocky
But maintain to ride and keep on rockin
From, city to city backyard to yard
And we, be seein the cites standin under the lights
And the spot is hot it's cold and lonely at nights
And I'm feenin and I'm dreamin and I'm holdin you tight
But hold on, every single road I rode on
Come to an end and I'm back home again
So baby please don't cry
Cause no valley low and is no mountain high
And our love don't die with the passage of time
It just grow more, it just keep strong
And even though I'm gone I ain't never too far
Your the light through the dark shinnin right through my heart
So my journey just start1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I didn't get no sleep at all last night
My shoulders were as heavy as lead
I felt something was just not right
I had to roll a little spliff for my head
So I took a walk inside
Talked to I, I self
Trying to ease these pains of mine
Oh, Jah give I strength

And if a egg, natty inna di red
And if a egg, natty inna di red
Rasta inna it, egg, natty inna di red
And if a egg, natty inna di red

Eh, now I'm in a irie place
Now I'm in a irie space
Now I man can I-ditate
Free ourselves from all that hate
Now I'm in an irie state
Now I man can I-ditate
Free ourselves from all that hate
Bless them with Jah love and grace
And if a egg, natty inna di red
And if a egg, natty inna di red
Rasta inna it, egg, egg, natty inna di red
And if a egg, natty inna di red

Eh, I didn't get no sleep at all first night, no
My shoulders we as heavy as lead
I felt something was just not right
Had to roll a little zig for my head, yeah
So I took a walk inside
Talk to I, I self
Free I from this frame of mind
Oh Jah, give I strength

And if a egg, natty inna di red
And if a egg, natty inna di
C'mon man and if a egg, natty inna di red
And if a egg, natty inna di red

None shall escape Jah judgment
Jah judgment's gonna call on you
Red eye, red eye, red eye
Red eye, you're gonna turn to blue
None shall escape Jah judgment
Jah judgment's gonna fall on you
Red eye, red eye, red eye
Red eye, you're gonna turn to blue
So when we call Him Rastafari
Watch how weak heart tremble
Heathen nah like Jah name1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

How many times I've told you I love you?
But now you want to say that we are through
What more can I do?
What more can I say to you?
Now you're gone...
Do you remember that first night we met?
That was a moment I never will forget
Love was at first sight wadada
And you came walking through the pale
Pale moonlight
Through the pale, through the pale

It's mind control, mind control
Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul
Mind control, it's mind control

Don't let them mould your mind, they want to control mankind
Seems like their only intention is to exploit the earth (hey)
And you trust in their deceit, your mind causes your defeat
And so you become an invention to distort this earth
Propaganda and lies, is a plague in our lives
How much more victimised, before we realise (hey)

Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul
Mind control, it's mind control
Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul
Ooh grand master, let the people go
You put them in total confusion, to downs-troy their soul
For they practise what you preach, so they're always in your reach
High-tech slavery in these days, it's mind control
They'll make it attractive, to get man distracted
Corrupting your, polluting your
Destroying (your soul, mind control)
Mind control
Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul
Mind control, it's mind control
Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul
Come on and, get it together brother man
What, what you say?

I keep telling you all the time
My flesh no weak so my heart is fine
Though my heart desire
Though that feel to no fire
You think i'm lovin you just for pleasure
But you’ve got the next thing coming
Cause i'll be there through storm, in wades
To keep that love like burning
And she said "Ras, you’re telling stories"
You own think that all laugh. It's so fairy tale
She said "one day you going ignore me"
Don't tell me that love gone shed again
I said "Woman, I love you"
Girl, I couldn't do you no wrong
Woman, I love you
Girl, I couldn't do you so wrong
Girl, I couldn't do you no wrong
Girl, I couldn't do you so wrong
Cause i said "she knows now". (x4)
No, that's not me. I don't cry
Tears don't come out of this eyes
Let me tell you one reason why
Non make up song of love I
Something that caught in my eyes
That´s not me. I don't cry
Crying, crying, crying...(x4)
Waiting so long for you, baby
You couldn’t let our love slip away
Cause loving no goes doesn't mean to me
You couldn’t  let our love slip away
Woman I...woman I....cause I said "she knows now" (x4)
Crying..crying..crying..(x4)
No, that's not me. I don't cryEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
