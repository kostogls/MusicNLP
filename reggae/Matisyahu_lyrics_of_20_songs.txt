Ooo-ahoo, ah-yah-ahha
Am-aba-ah-ah-oh-oh
(One day, one day, one day)
Am-ah-ah-ah-oh-oh

Sometimes I lay under the moon and thank God I'm breathing
Then I pray, "Don't take me soon, 'cause I am here for a reason"

Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around, because...

All my life I've been waiting for, I've been praying for
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more, there'll be no more wars
And our children will play
One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-ohh)
One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-ohh)

It's not about win or lose, 'cause we all lose when they feed
On the souls of the innocent, blood-drenched pavement
Keep on moving though the waters stay raging
In this maze, you can lose your way (Your way)
It might drive you crazy, but don't let it phase you, no way (No way)
Sometimes in my tears I drown (I drown)
But I never let it get me down (Get me dow-own)
So when negativity surrounds (Surrounds)
I know some day it'll all turn around, because...

All my life I've been waiting for (Waiting for)
I've been praying for (Praying for)
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more (Fight no more)
They'll be no more war (No more war)
And our children will play
One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-ohh, one day)
One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-ohh)

One day this all will change, treat people the same
Stop with the violence, down with the hate
One day we'll all be free, and proud to be
Under the same sun, singing songs of freedom like:
Why-ohhh , why-ohh-ohh-ohh
(One day, one day, oh-oh-oh)
Why-ohhh, why-ohh-ohh-ohh
(One day, one day, oh-oh-oh)
All my life I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
For the people to say (Ay-yay-yay-yay-yay-oh)
That we don't wanna fight no more (Ay-yay-yay-yay-yay-oh)
They'll be no more war
And our children will play
(Why-ohhh , why-ohh-ohh-ohh)
One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-ohh)
(Why-ohhh , why-ohh-ohh-ohh)
One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-ohh)

Ooo-ahoo, ah-yah-ahha

You're all that I have and you're all that I need
Each and every day I pray to get to know you, please
I want to be close to you, yes I'm so hungry
You're like water for my soul when it gets thirsty
Without you there's no me
You're the air that I breathe
Sometimes the world is dark and I just can't see
With these, demons surround all around to bring me down to negativity
But I believe, yes I believe, I said I believe
I'll stand on my own two feet
Won't be brought down on one knee
Fight with all of my might and get these demons to flee
HaShem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe
HaShem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe
Out of darkness comes light, twilight unto the heights
Crown Heights burnin' up all through till twilight
Said thank you to my God, now I finally got it right
And I'll fight with all of my heart, and all a' my soul, and all a' my might

What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
I give myself to you from the essence of my being and I
Sing to my god, songs of love and healing
I want Moshiach now, time we start revealing
What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
I give myself to you from the essence of my being and I
Sing to my god, songs of love and healing
I want Moshiach now
Strippin’ away the layers and reveal your soul
Got to give yourself up and then you become whole
You're a slave to yourself and you don't even know
You want to live the fast life but your brain moves slow
If you're trying to stay high, bound to stay low
You want God but you can't deflate your ego
If you're already there then there's nowhere to go
If your cup's already full then its bound to overflow
If you're drowning in the waters and you can't stay afloat
Ask Hashem for mercy, and he'll throw you a rope
You're looking for help from God you say he couldn't be found
Searching up to the sky and looking beneath the ground
Like a King without his Crown
You keep fallin' down
You really want to live but can't get rid of your frown
Tried to reach unto the heights and wound bound down on the ground
Given up your pride and then you heard a sound
Out of night comes day and out of day comes light
Nullified to the One like sunlight in a ray
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze


See I lift up my eyes where my help come from
And I seen it circling around from the mountain
Thunder!
You feel it in your chest
You keep my mind at ease and my soul at rest
You're not vexed
Look to the sky where my help come from
Seen it circling around from the mountain
Thunder!
You feel it in your chest
You keep my mind at ease and my soul at rest
You're not vexed12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Keep on moving to the first rays of dawn
Keeping it on 'til the day stays strong
Runnin 'til the night time blazes on
All along I keep singing my song
I said, this phase is always
Sometimes I get so fased
But just know that ill always stay
Cause your my light through the haze

Its time for a champion
Soothe the soul of the land
Mend the heart from the sea and the sand
Until the sun comes up again
Its time for a champion
Soothe the soul of the land
Mend the heart from the sea and the sand
Until the sun comes up again

Reach for the sky
Keep your eye on the prize
Forever in my mine
You're my golden sunshine
Fits raining in your mind
So push those clouds aside
Forever by my side
You're my golden sunshine
In the sunset I let myself down
Found the ground beneath my feet gone
No more words were there to speak
On that day my song was born
Never meant to leave you all alone
Said I'd be your shelter from the storm
Now your clothes have all been torn
Kingdom sacked attacked and dethroned

Its time for a champion
Soothe the soul of the land
Mend the heart from the sea and the sand
Until the sun comes up again
Its time for a champion
Soothe the soul of the land
Mend the heart from the sea and the sand
Until the sun comes up again
Reach for the sky
Keep your eye on the prize
Forever in my mine
You're my golden sunshine
Fits raining in your mind
So push those clouds aside
Forever by my side
You're my golden sunshine
It's the way of the world
Your on your own
Time to grow and be a man
Want to fly high like peter pan
No more never never land
So lose your backpack filled with sand
Come along now take my hand
We'll walk together- walk forever

Reach for the sky
Keep your eye on the prize
Forever in my mine
You're my golden sunshine
Fits raining in your mind
So push those clouds aside
Forever by my side
You're my golden sunshine
Reach for the sky
Keep your eye on the prize
Forever in my mine
You're my golden sunshine
Fits raining in your mind
So push those clouds aside
Forever by my side
You're my golden sunshine

Jerusalem, if I forget you
Fire not gonna come from me tongue
Jerusalem, if I forget you
Let my right hand forget what it's supposed to do
In the ancient days, we will return with no delay
Picking up the bounty and the spoils on our way
We've been traveling from state to state
And them don't understand what they say
3,000 years with no place to be
And they want me to give up my milk and honey
Don't you see, it's not about the land or the sea
Not the country but the dwelling of his majesty

Rebuild the temple and the crown of glory
Years gone by, about sixty
Burn in the oven in this century
And the gas tried to choke, but it couldn't choke me
I will not lie down, I will not fall asleep
They come overseas, yes they're trying to be free
Erase the demons out of our memory
Change your name and your identity
Afraid of the truth and our dark history
Why is everybody always chasing we
Cut off the roots of your family tree
Don't you know that's not the way to be

Caught up in these ways, and the worlds gone craze
Don't you know it's just a phase
Case of the Simon says
If I forget the truth then my words won't penetrate
Babylon burning in the place, can't see through the haze
Chop down all of them dirty ways
That's the price that you pay for selling lies to the youth
No way, not ok, oh no way, not ok, hey
Ain't no one gonna break my stride
Ain't no one gonna pull me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Stay alive3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Feel like the world don’t love you
They only wanna push you away
Some days people don’t see you
You feel like you’re in the way
Today, you feel as everyone hates
Pointing their finger looking at your mistakes
You do good, they want great
No matter what you give, they still wanna take
You give your love and they throw it back
You give your heart, they go on attack
When there’s nothing left for you
Only thing that you can do, say
(Chorus)
Today, today, live like you wanna
Let yesterday burn and throw it in a fire
In a fire, in a fire
Fight like a warrior
Today, today, live like you wanna
Let yesterday burn and throw it in a fire
In a fire, in a fire
Live like a warrior
There some things you should let go
They’re only gonna pull you down
Just like weight on your shoulder
They’re only gonna make you drown
We all swing high, we all swing low
We all got secrets people don’t know
We all got dreams we can’t let go
We wanna be brave, don’t be afraid, no
(Chorus)
Today, today, live like you wanna
Let yesterday burn and throw it in a fire
In a fire, in a fire
Fight like a warrior
Today, today, live like you wanna
Let yesterday burn and throw it in a fire
In a fire, in a fire
Live like a warrior
Your heart is so heavy
From things you carry a long time
Been up, you been down
Tired and you don’t know why
But you’re never gonna go back
You only live one life
Let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go
(Chorus)
Today, today, live like you wanna
Let yesterday burn and throw it in a fire
In a fire, in a fire
Fight like a warrior
Today, today, live like you wanna
Let yesterday burn and throw it in a fire
In a fire, in a fire
Live like a warrior
Today, today, live like you wanna
Let yesterday burn and throw it in a fire
In a fire, in a fire
Fight like a warrior
Today, today, live like you wanna
Let yesterday burn and throw it in a fire
In a fire, in a fire

Let go, of what ya know
Return to the land of the rainbow
Where the sun hangs low, and the wind does blow
And the time it moves so slow
It creeps and go, through the window
Turn to the land where the wild may roam
And the buffalo go, yeah the buffalo go
Where the wild may roam, yeah
Across the country side search far and wide
Diggin’ till I reach up on the other side
Streams and the rivers and the oceans and there’s trees
And I’ll swim with the fishes down deep
(Chorus)
I’ve been searching for you
I’ve been searching far and wide
I’ve been searching for you
All my life, my life
I’ve been searching for you
I’ve been searching far and wide
I’ve been searching for you
All my life, my life, my life
Lift your eyes, up on the hillside
Sunrise and I fight to see through the lies
Keep upon the skies and the clouds so high
When I fly to the heights I’m feeling oh so right
Running ‘pon the land and I’m picking up sand
When I stand and deliver the plan
Won’t you please back down or get slammed to the ground
When my sound strike thunder
While you pillage and plunder
Now you wonder why you’re going under
Got yourself on the run from the number one
That you can’t run from
Your spirit fades, you feel hunger
I’ve been searching for you
I’ve been searching far and wide
I’ve been searching for you
All my life, my life
I’ve been searching for you
I’ve been searching far and wide
I’ve been searching for you
All my life, my life, my life
In the earth there are so many wonderful treasures
And if you know where to dig then you’ll find gold and diamond
I’ve been searching for you
I’ve been searching far and wide
I’ve been searching for you
All my life, my life
I’ve been searching for you
I’ve been searching far and wide
I’ve been searching for you
All my life, my life, my life
In the earth there are so many wonderful treasures
And if you know where to dig you’ll find gold and diamonds and silver
And all kinds of treasures
But if you don’t know where to dig, all you’ll find is rock and dirt
A rebbe is the geologist of the soul
He can show you where to dig, and what to dig for
But the digging you must do yourself
The digging you must do yourself3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Back to the hold
Back to the old
Back to the gold
Still and steady
Got these subs in my Chevy
Feeling heavy
These lead pipes they don't tread lightly
Sitting silently
Living with myself
Limited capacity
No more catastrophe
Catastrophic epiphany
Epic stories of my history
Disproportionate display to intoxicate my luminaries
But with all that..
Dysfunction got the best of me
Disseminate the wellsprings
With no apologies
I'm giving up
I'm giving in
All I got is-
What's right in front of me
What's right in front of me
Is the people that I see
And the places that I be
I've been blessed but I've been tossed around this sea
And the love that got buried deep down beneath
Seen in a vision on a BQE with a test to see
Restlessness it got the best of me
When the curtain dropped down
When the lights went on
When the music stopped
Ain't got no song
When the words ran out
And my voice is shot-
Hey there superstar
Not feeling so hot
Tryna be a superman
With superfans
Doing a handstand
While writing your name in the sand
Heard you got a master plan
Made of plaster from the masters hands
After Matthew and his cast of characters
Passed through your land
After the blast just passed
Disasters aftermath
And your craft is on
I'm giving up
I'm giving in
All I got is-
What's right in front of me
What's right in front of me
Is the people that I see
And the places that I be
I've been blessed but I've been tossed up round this sea
And the love that got buried deep down beneath
Seen in a vision on a BQE with a test to see
Restlessness ain't got the best of me
I'm giving up
Im giving in
All I got is-
What's right in front of me
What's right in front of me
Is the people that I see
And the places that I be
I've been blessed but I've been tossed around this sea
And the love that got buried deep down beneath
Seen in a vision on a BQE with a test to see
Restlessness it got the best of meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The world is moving to the song I hear
Who's that singing, wind is rushing in my ear
Mind gushing memories almost lost everything
Felony and fellows running in my dream
We were in the van where the hits were driving
Saw myself In the highlands at age 13
And I'm asking questions to the present day me
Moving backwards down the hill see we were posting
(Chorus)
Moonlight illuminate my night and my days sunray make the people say
And a vision something's missing so they're screaming out loud
Keep my feet on ground and my head in the clouds
I'm the arrow, you're my bow, shoot me forth and I will go
And I know and I go and I go get up and go
Make me feel its for real tell me what you know
I don't need to glorify
Ate the apple of the tree and tried to lie
In the garden ill remember
That's when I started to sing
I said death brings life into uncertain things
Cut some slack for me
Sun setting autumn breeze
Sound is moving like a chorus
Keep hearing that melody
Check the radio but theres nothing playing
Check the radio again but theres nothing playing
(Chorus)
Rewind:
Dub-wise!
Swing low, sweet chariot of flames
Change my name, Yo!
It Was always the same
Till if only what you find when you climb
Check the radio but of all that shines there's no time
My life is making your mind work in overtime
But along the line you'll have to pay for the crime
Slow it down You turbo too soon
Vroom vroom then you want to blast off unto the moon
But you might get trapped in a temple of doom
You might get trapped in a temple of doom

Three shots upon the sky
Three bluebirds flying by
Three sons remind me why
I ended up in Crown Heights

Where's my confidence?
You know you want it all
Believe in yourself
Even after the fall
I wish I knew that one
A long time ago

Now when I walk in the street
Got that hop in my step
Chest out head back
Yeah you know what I rep
Strut like a Rasta
Though I'm being chased by death
I'll be gone 'til whenever
Like the song by Wyclef
Listening to music
Always gave me vision
So when you see me on the street
I'll be walkin' to the rhythm
Focus in my face
That's the way I'm straight livin'
Champion heart
From the start of the beginning
I've been lookin' for the palace
A crown and a throne
Click-clack
Around Krakow
Typing on my phone
Tackling my demons
But you know that by now
Chassidic reggae superstar
Tell you all how
Got it on the inside
I don't need to wear it out
Can't say I'm not religious
I just let go of the doubt
And right about now
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey
I like old things
Things that go slow
Antiques and such
So what ya know?
I'm an old soul
That's the way I like to go
Thankful for the bumps
I like to feel the road
How can I defend
Against snakes and scorpions?
Trying to be your friends
Then they cut you in the end
Feel the sleep moving
Collapse and give in then I start again
How can I pretend?

Got it on the inside
I don't need to wear it out
Can't say I'm not religious
I just let go of the doubt
And right about now
I'm a let go of this trout
Whispering my pleas, I ain't gotta be loud
Throw it in the sea, throw it back to the sea
Underneath the clouds
Know what I mean
This is my silent scream
Doing as I please
I bless you with the ease
Why these dudes judging me?

Take a piece of herb and break it up
Roll it up, take a shot to the head top
Hit nice, Hit nice
Me a wine wit the gal dem
Everyting nice, ting nice
Everybody have vibes and me no wan hear no gun shot
Hear vibes, good vibes
Over some foolishness, some people, dem a come shot
So people are rich yo
Some people dem a hit yo
Some people a go tru life and not care about nobody else
A little bit yo
Yi have the confidence to keep strong
Have the confidence to hol on
No more pestilence in our residence
The Lord Testament from All em'
It's not the easy road but we have to live it
Anything in life
Put in all of your heart, your mind, and your soul
Remember the greatest gift is love
I need some confidence
How can I walk tall
With the critic in my head?
Won't rest till I feel small2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You quench my thirsting soul and you fill my appetite
I give myself to you because you treat me right
Put my trust in the world and the world gets tight
Shift my trust to you it's like a crystal clear night
Expand in all directions get the sections to unite
Hashem's rays fire blaze light my way light of my life
And these days well wait no longer night
Reaching for my G-d like skyscrapers in the night
I said I know its hard inside is empty galus (exile) cuts like a knife
Internalize torah vibes bound to feel alright
Chorus:
Whirlwind of praise from below to above
Take flight in the sky got wings like a dove
Soaring to shamayim (heaven) where the angels call in love
And the glory of Hashem fits like a glove
Hashem rules the world and Israel is his wife
Love you yes my G-d with all my heart my soul and my might
When I feel you by my side yes I'm flying like a kite
You open up my eyes and give me sight
Super energized and everyday I feel you give me life
I seen the ways of the world intoxifying on pride
Young man don't you know drugs impurify your mind
When Israel left mitzrayim four fifths got left behind
If you got no water how you gonna survive
Roots lead you to the well springs so you could stay alive
Pharaoh claimed to be a G-d and claimed to make the Nile
A crocodile could smile and show his teeth
You could see beauty shining externally but that's the story of Greece
Inside America bleeds, Israel won't you get up from your knees
Its just lies in disguise Torah's truth won't you please realize
Given to the humble one on Mt. Sinai
Chorus
Shma Y'sroel, Hashem Elokainu, Hashem Echad
(Hear Israel, the lord is our G-d, the lord is one)
The world could just crumble to dust its just us it's not two it's just one
The middle road called truth, Torah you sooth my brain bruise
Open up peruse with knowledge of G-d
And move up an arousal from below till the secrets start to ooze
Don't snooze it's pure light the most high wants us alive
What's the proof?
We got life!
Chabad philosophy that's the deepest well-spring
Gaining knowledge of G-d while your gaining money
Fill up yourself with the light of his majesty
In a world of separation that's the only way to be
It's time we leave we won't flee just walk out easily
If you got no water how you gonna survive

Watch the weight of the wind blow
Watchin faces out my window
Vs. 1
To the people on they grind
To the country out its mind
Half grins
Half spun like a dreidel
No middle to my know how
Slow down for the show now
I'd rather be alone than explain how
Wake up and walk out
Take up and take out
Shake up and shake out
My demons waitin on every corner just
to pull me down
They follow me around
They're in my blood as the leaves hit the
ground and the wind from the willow
My only shield is the sound
My feelings release in these sounds
Get free in these sounds
Let it bleed in these sounds
In these verbs in these nouns
In these words build a boat
Take me though stormy seas till my
feet hit the ground
Hit the ground running
Hit the town humming
Ancient melodies come back to me now
come back to me now
Ancient melodies come back to me now
come back
Stop and ask the question
Like Nachman I loose the vision
enter to the fog
Driving down this mountain to the ocean
floor where you've never gone before
open up the door to a room you've
chosen to ignore
Swimming in a ocean of fear
You've been swimming in an ocean of fear
Through the unknown and the unclear
Through the unknown and the unclear
Fear of ya life
Fear of ya knife
Cut open this tightly stitched world that
you made examine inside
Take up and take out
Shake up and shake out
Shake it off gotta shake up the vibe

You've been traveling the speed of light
You been searching
You been movin all of ya life
You been reaching
You been running out of sight
You been seeking
Disappearing into the light
Into the light you been taken to
Vs. 2
Now ya digging up the grave stone
Breaking up the glass house that
you craved for
Breaking up the paved road that you made
Entering the maze
fear of the strange
Fear of the waves as they crash down
Once sung
Of a longing once felt
Like a trophy that you won and kept it
on the mantle
Time to dismantle
Get a handle
Takin off you sandals
Lighting up the candles
Now ya livin in shambles
Ramble on with the bros
Ramble on the pros
Cons can't hack it
With my jacket
Causing a racket
Take a crack and crackle
Tackling competition with my mission
Livin with the vision
Or touch the moonlight
Wake up and walk out
Take up and take out
Shake up and shake out
Shake it off gotta shake up the vibe

Traveling at the speed of light

On the day when a man was born, hop from one world to another
I don’t know who you are, even when we face each other
When I wake up I know you’re here, this is everything that you’ve done
I’ve got nothing to fear, because the battles already been won
(Chorus)
This is the time of divine favor
Sublime love cuts, like a razor
Burning up our fear and pain
Ascending fire like a laser beam
This is the time of divine favor
Sublime love cuts, like a razor
Burning up our fear and pain
Ascending fire like a laser beam
Search heavens and the seven seas
The answer lies inside you
You know it won’t come easy
You’ve got to find your own truth
When I returned to the lower garden I saw many souls living and dead
Rushing back and forth ascending from one world to the next
The joy was too great for our ears to hear or for words to express
All were bein forgiven for stolen time and debts
Asked me to come with them, cause of the glory of your contemplation
You’ve been given eyes to see, looking for a prophet to accompany me
But alone I must go on my own, flyin with my very own set of wings
I reached the highest heights, knocking on the door of the king of kings
(Chorus)
This is the time of divine favor
Sublime love cuts, like a razor
Burning up our fear and pain
Ascending fire like a laser beam
This is the time of divine favor
Sublime love cuts, like a razor
Burning up our fear and pain
Ascending fire like a laser beam
Search heavens and the seven seas
The answer lies inside you
You know it won’t come easy
You’ve got to find your own truth
(Verse/Outro)
It’s your life to live; I can’t live it for you
It’s your time to give and I can’t give it for you
It’s your fear to lose; I can’t lose it for you
Death or life so choose and I put both before you
So, find your word of truth
You’ve got to find your word of truth
It’s your life to live; I can’t live it for you
It’s your time to give and I can’t give it for you
Search heavens and the seven seas
The answer lies inside you
You know it won’t come easy
You’ve got to find your own truthEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"Of David. Do not compete with the wicked; do not envy those who commit injustice. For like grass they will soon wither, like green vegetation. Trust in the Lord and do good, then you will abide in the land and be nourished by faith. Delight in the Lord, and He will guard your desires and needs, and take care of you. You reveal your righteousness like a light, and your judgments are on high. Depend on the Lord and hope for Him; compete not with the prosperous, with the man who invents evil schemes. Let go of anger, abandon rage; do not compete with one who intends only to harm. For the evildoers will be cut down; but those who hope in the Lord, they will inherit the earth."
I just wanna talk to You now
This is for the One
You kept me alive
And so I thank You
Moses is on his way down town
Yoshua maintaining the fountain
Right about now I should be over Chicago, lights out the window
Levee breaks, flow like diamonds
All these babies crying, ideas flying around
It’s time to come down from the mountain
Welcome home, just stick to the plan
But how can I be like the stars and sand?
It's only man who commands
He put this one in our hands
Two tabs of stone, I'm alone while these fans keep circling
Over the land like helicopter blades, I crave some breeze
Will you wait, wait for me, please?
Forty days and forty nights, but I can't stand much more
So you think you understand what’s pure and impure?
Now it's pouring my soul on the floor
You think ya know so much, that I'm so out of touch
I tossed in the crutch to the אֵשׁ תָּמִיד
I walk with a limp, with a wound that bleeds
While all these animals feed with their envy and greed
Smoke marijuana seed
Wanna chop this tree
Cut me down, pressure to concede
And give in to what they believe is me
But I'ma fight, I'm a light, I'm the glory of the King
I'm the song that you sing, the melody that you bring
Sharp teeth and venom that stings not gonna bring me to my knees
I'm a fish in this here sea, evil eye won't get at me
I just want to finish this thing
Not gonna bring me to my knees
I'm going down, down to go up
From the pits to מצרים, from the dungeon to the kingdom
To my stage offering, can't give up and won't give in
I am the blood of Jacob and I'll keep struggling
Like Joseph, my brothers wanna sell me out
I had the dream, time to leave the doubt
Multicolored coat with blood on my sleeves
Best believe it ain't from no beasts
Got no car, I walked around this reservoir
This is David’s heart, rainbow-colored cry
From the end to the start, this is David’s heart
A rainbow-colored cry from the end to the start
Phantoms and ghosts, raise your glass and make a toast
This is for the One

Some of them come now
Some of them running
Some of them looking for fun
Some of them looking for a way out of confusion
Some of them don't know where to be
Some of them don't know where to go
Some of them trust their instincts
That something's missing from the show
Some don't fit society
Their insides are crying low
Some of them teachers squashed the flame
'Fore it had a chance to grow
Some of them embers still glow
Them charcoal hushed and low
Some of them come with a hunger suppressed
Not fed them feel the death blow, yo
Young man, control in your hand
Slam your fist on the table
And make your demand
Take a stand, fan the fire for the flame of the youth
Got the freedom to choose
You better make the right move
Young man, the power's in your hand
Slam your fist on the table
And make your demand
You got to make the right move
"Youth is the engine of the world"
"Youth is the engine of the world"
Storm the halls of vanity
Focus your energy
Into a laser beam
Streaming shattered light
Unites to pierce between the seams and it seems
See the world open peering the children see
Rapid fire for your mind
Half the truth is just a lie
They rub me the wrong way
They say their way or fall behind
Seventeen disconnect left out
The concept as to why
There's a spiritual emptiness
So the youth them get vexed
Skip class and get wrecked
Feel with music and cigarettes
To fill the hole in their chest!
Young man, control in your hand
Slam your fist on the table
And make your demand
Take a stand, fan the fire for the flame of the youth
Got the freedom to choose
You better make the right move
Young man, the power's in your hand
Slam your fist on the table
And make your demand
You better make the right move
You got the freedom to choose
You better make the right move
You got the freedom to choose
Young man, control in your hand
Slam your fist on the table
And make your demand
Take a stand, fan the fire for the flame of the youth
Got the freedom to choose
You better make the right move
Young man, the power's in your hand
Slam your fist on the table
And make your demand
You better make the right move
"Youth is the engine of the world"
"Youth is the engine of the world"

From the forest itself comes the handle for the axe
Split this wilderness, listen, I'm not missing where it's at
Clear a path so that you could find your way back
Chop 'em down, chop 'em down;
Chop 'em down, chop 'em down

Time flies by like clouds passing in the sky
Lifetimes even gone in the blink of an eye
March through the desert one-step at a time, march through the desert one step at a time

From the forest itself comes the handle for the ax
Drop the staff Moshe Rabbeinu split the ocean in half
March through the desert this ain't where it's at
Chop 'em down, Chop 'em down
Chop 'em down, chop 'em down

Patterns engraved not so easily erased
Still wandering trying to find your place
Playing the game I see pain on your face
Now a day's the Yidden like children sold as slaves
Strange ways running through the maze, strange ways always
Lost in the desert trying to find your way
Lost in the desert trying to find your way
From the forest itself comes the handle for the axe
Split this wilderness, listen, I'm not missing where it's at
Clear a path so that you could find your way back
Chop 'em down, chop 'em down;
Chop 'em down, chop 'em down

Yosef descended sold as a slave
Thrown into a dungeon cause he wouldn't be swayed
Interpreted Pharaoh's dreams and Egypt was saved
Stock piled food for seven years of rain
Then sold to all the nations when the drought came
Yosef rose to power and the Yidden stayed
They started to build and success was made
Pharaoh is getting worried let's make them pay
Bound in chains, first born was sent down to their graves
Moshe was saved and a prince he was raised
Hashem spoke to him, "Here's a message to relay
Take my Nation from Mitzrayim (Egypt) I see the suffering"
Hard hearts ego breaks take sparks and make way
Trail blaze through the wasteland breaking the chains

Last generation just the ruminants
March through the desert leaving footprints
Peel off the lid this is just plastic, get into it, get into it
Heavy hitter stepping solid never quitter jump into the ocean before it split got a jump into it
Rip through Egypt rip through it
Get into it, 600,000 witnessed it, no you didn't forget
In the spiritual desert things are not what they seem
Snakes camouflaged just fit the scene
Put your faith in a mirage it's just a smoke screen
Took that path, and you know we're in needEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Where can I find relief from this heaviness?
Lie down in a forest
A forest of emunah
Vs. 1
Shattered vessels
Poisoned arrow
Sparkle in your eyes
Shining gold like pharaoh
Write it on a sign
Sing it out
Or keep it deep down inside
Holy holy holy
Am I built for my life?
Start with the wound
Start with the knife
Make the incision
Cuttin up my world and step out into the light
Deliver what you listen to
"
(Chorus)
What a man gotta do
"
"
"
To get through to you
Vs. 2
Air is free
Witches wolves with grins lurking staring at me
Under foot damp leaves
In the forest of faith
"
In the forest of emunah
Colonial ghosts make sounds like woosh
Horseman's head
Ride through the night line
British are coming the sight line
Revolution ignite mine
Sleepy days
The sun rays
Filled with golden glaze
From across the way
Sinking bridges
not burnt couldn't take the test of time
Building new ones
Sailboat bells chime
The moonlight
Days go on and get long
It was time to say strong and move on
Leaves changin and these days countin
Pressure building
Now ya going back to the sea of your life
(Chorus)
Vs. 3
You're the dark and the light
Wind and the kite
The reason I stay
Up all the time
Oxygen for my flame
Swimming upstream
"
"
Sing, Sing, Singing all the way
Wake up right now from your nightmare
Arise from the dust
Daffodil trees and these breeze don't lie
So sit back and just ride
No one to blame
Tried all the keys
And so I believe
Nothing left in this
Snow builds through the winter
Tactics division exactly distracting tracks of blacklist
Backflips twisting whistling thoughts
Tranquility
Lay down in the grass with my head in your lap but
these feelings collapse it was fantasy
Yeah you wanna believe
Yeah you wanna believe
It was you and me for eternity
One with thee you are one with me
Elementary together we must be
Flee the time and the century
Where can I be
Find a jet line through the sky
High above the clouds
Craving for the day
When my highs will start to say
Leave them all behind
I need healing
Living for these times
Breaking through my soul this time
Shift shape flames rise
When the feelings overEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

No matter where I am, bless me with all your light
I'm on the train, brain vexed connect, and then I feel blessed
Whether day or night, I'm on the street, midtown New York City
Let me stop praise your name, I need room to breath
I want to feel your ease; I got to feel your peace
Screaming, down on my, because my insides bleed
My hearts on fire witnessed all the vampires
Yes I came hear on a to inspire

Close my eyes and take a ride inside
Feel the breeze blow by yo I'm getting' you high
Bob Nesta said it best everything will be all right
Introspect connect the sect's and let this music make you fly
I listened' to the wind whistle in a channel of sound
My ear like a vacuum begin to boom
Glisten like the sun heats a drum
Cursing' all of them doomed rising' up from the ground
Growing full like the moon
Said I'm planting like a seed yes sir
Them get up and get up and grow and I'm firm like a tree
Well I know that's all I know
That some their colors wonderful like it was a rainbow
Let me tell you one time if you didn't know

Moonlight enlighten my way at twilight
From the heights of my roof I send praise then poof
I'm looking up at the night
And ask for help to get up and get up and get up and get up and get it right
Jerusalem you take me high make me fly like arrow in the sky2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Don't let it faze ya
No way, you're
An astronaut in your spaceship
Who's got walking to the moon
In your spacesuit with your laser
Touching darkness like Darth Vader
With the strength of your creator
Angels all around ya
Surround ya with good nature
You got light
Yeah, you got light so bright
It can slice through the equator
Ancient fathers before you
To continue their adventure
'Cuz the lower you get
Helps you understand your neighbour
'Till you shred through all these layers
And after that
When you've cut this world in half
And you move into your prayer
You're a knight in shining armour
With the kingdom at your back
You're no stranger
Your despair, ya
Gives you power
That's a fact
When you climb these lonely towers
And you found your way back
Will you carry me?
Will you carry me?
Through the desert sun
Through the desert sun
Will you carry me?
Will you carry me?
Through the desert sun
Through the desert sun
Run for the rhythm
And the timing's right
When you're lost at sea
Can't find your light
When the night goes on
And your song won't sing
And the chest is tight
And the bells won't ring
Look up to the stars
And know you're one of them
Shining in the darkness
To all the children
Remind them of a day
When the clouds will go away
And the sun will shine our way
When one day will be today
And the king will find his crown
And the light will be put down
To his kingdom on the ground
You've been searching all around
Now you've found
Raise me up into your town
Dancing all around
Raise me up into your town
Dancing all around
Will you carry me?
Will you carry me?
Through the desert sun
Through the desert sun
Will you carry me?
Will you carry me?
Through the desert sun
Through the desert sun
Will you carry me?
Will you carry me?
Through the desert sun
Through the desert sun
Will you carry me?
Will you carry me?
Through the desert sun
Through the desert sunEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It’s like I’m walking through this kingdom of time
Thus far I’ve done lost my mind
Only to find the other side
Is where the world
Opens wide
Through desolate city streets late at night
I’ve been searching for my bite
They say I inspired, but I’m still looking for my fire
These lies have got me tired
I’m free falling, I’m done stalling
I’m done crawling up this mountain top
I won’t stop till I manifest my crop
The top is close
I’m sky scraping
They stay chasing
I'm like a raisin in the sun
I’m running from death’s invasion
They’re done, I’m going gray
I’m still young having mystic visions
Of **the One**, I hear the hum, the melody comes
Rushing in like some wind
Cuts close like a knife
All I got is my life
All I got I got I got
Crossroads, one million miles
I’m kickin’ up dirt when I fly by
Crossroads, one million miles
I’m kickin’ up dirt when I fly by
Now the rain is falling drizzle drop on the street
Clean off the dirt beneath my feet
I got this beat on repeat
While I’m riding subway trains on a fact over tracks
That go,"CLACK", my heart’s black
But intact I’ve come to take the music back
I’m moving forward so you can’t ignore it
Put the pedal to the floor
Stay pure
Throught the slime and the scum
The time has come I Lunge for it
I’m tight rope
Walking over fiery flames and hot coals
I’m like water for you trolls
I pay no tolls
Speak to ghosts
And find the Most High
In cracks that you walk by
Got my eye in tuned to you goons
Magic fly off on a broom...witch's stew
Which way to choose i’m at the crossroads
But I’ll never give my soul, it’s already OWNED
Crossroads, one million miles
I’m kicking up dirt when i’m flying high
Crossroads, one million miles
I’m kicking up dirt when i’m flying high
I’m a slave to the throne
The chariot of flames is my home
I’m in a class of my own
Lights out, you’re all alone, with your heart of stone
O-o-o-o-o-oh-oh
Crossroads, one million miles
I’m kicking up dirt when i’m flying high
Crossroads, one million miles
I’m kicking uṗ dirt when i’m flying high
Crossroads, one million miles
I’m kicking up dirt when i’m flying high
Crossroads, one million miles
I’m kicking up dirt when i’m flying high

You're all that I have and you're all that I need
Each and every day I pray to get to know you please
I want to be close to you, yes I'm so hungry
You're like water for my soul when it gets thirsty
Without you there's no me
You're the air that I breathe
Sometimes the world is dark and I just can't see
With these, demons surround all around to bring me down to negativity
But I believe, yes I believe, I said I believe
I'll stand on my own two feet
Won't be brought down on one knee
Fight with all of my might and get these demons to flee
Hashem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe
Out of darkness comes light, twilight unto the heights
Crown Heights burnin' up all through till midnight
Said, thank you to my G-d, now I finally got it right
And I'll fight with all of my heart, and all a' my soul, and all a' my might
What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
Givin' myself to you from the essence of my being
Sing to my G-d all these songs of love and healing
Want Moshiach now so it's time we start revealing
Me no want no sinsemilla
That would only bring me down
Burn away my brain no way my brain is to compound
Torah food for my brain let it rain till I drown
Thunder!
Let the blessings come down
Strip away the layers and reveal your soul
Got to give yourself up and then you become whole
You're a slave to yourself and you don't even know
You want to live the fast life but your brain moves slow
If you're trying to stay high then you're bound to stay low
You want G-d but you can't deflate your ego
If you're already there then there's nowhere to go
If you're cup's already full then its bound to overflow
If you're drowning in the water's and you can't stay afloat
Ask Hashem for mercy and he'll throw you a rope
You're looking for help from G-d you say he couldn't be found
Looking up to the sky and searchin' beneath the ground
Like a King without his Crown
Yes, you keep fallin' down
You really want to live but can't get rid of your frown
Tried to reach unto the heights and wound bound down on the ground
Given up your pride and the you heard a sound
Out of night comes day and out of day comes light
Nullified to the One like sunlight in a ray
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze
Reelin' him in
Where ya been
Where ya been
Where ya been for so long
It's hard to stay strong been livin' in galus  for 2000 years strong
Where ya been for so long
Been livin in this exhile for too longEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
