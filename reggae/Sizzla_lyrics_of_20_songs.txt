Oh ah oh ah yay! Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh, yeah ay yeah ay!

They can't keep a good man down
Always keep a smile when they want me to frown
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
They will never ever take my crown
Who Jah bless I say no man curse
Things gettin better when they thought it would be worst
Here comes the officers askin for a search, they found no weapon just only a draw of herbs

Cause I'm so solid as a rock they just can't stop me now
Even when they set their traps they just can't stop me now
People will say this and that they just can't stop me now
Even when they set up road blocks they just can't stop me now

When they come with they evilest thoughts I just listen whenever they talk
Jah is the light into my dark, he cut and clear all my path
They fight without a cause tryin to make my life so hard
The king of kings and the lord of lords, giveth all rewards

So solid as a rock they just can't stop me now
Even when they set their traps they just can't stop me now
People will say this and that they just can't stop me now
Even when they set up road blocks they just can't stop me now
So don't you mix me up with your dirty games, your only tryin to tarnish my name
Your only lookin for the innocent to blame, when your the ones who issue the guns down the lane
You only cause dysfunction and frame, but the righteous believes in the reign
Love is all I got to give and I'm not ashamed, looking towards the future this lion can't tame

Cause I'm so solid as a rock and they just can't stop me now
Even when they set their traps they just can't stop me now
People will say this and that they just can't stop me now
Even when they set up road blocks they just can't stop me now

I'm missing you

Dry cry - even tears
Even my heart cries but who cares
Whose fault? No one but myself
Things do happen, words can't explain
The only human reasoning joy meets with pain
People would spend time just for us to separate
They don't want to see us reach nowhere
Oh girl and you know I care

Why does it have to be this way?
Can't tell you go, can't tell you to stay
Just one of those days
Just one of those days

Am I too humble or ignorant?
Things began to fade, nothing seems important
Oh my girl has left me and gone
Doesn't want to see her in another's arm
The essence of her beauty and charm
The perfume still lingers... oh damn
Remember girl where we coming from
I'm the one to who you belong
Whoa yay
Girl you keep me strong
You, I don want another one
Why does it have to be this way?
Can't tell you go, can't tell you to stay
Just one of those days
Just one of those days

Keep looking to see her at my gate
Listening to hear the phone ring by the fireplace
Now, somewhere out there is my girl
Now, where can I find her in this world?
Still not gonna break down
Nor be sad even though I'm stressed out
Fed up and feeling mad
I just can't do it wit out her
Oh, Jah
Still I got to try

Why does it have to be this way?
Can't tell you go, can't tell you to stay
Just one of those days
Just one of those days

Is this happening for real?
Only if you know the pangs that I feel
Still tryin to doo my best
And I still won't lose my intrest
My girl I love u soo
Really hurts to see you go3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Something in the back of my head keeps reminding me
Keep on listening ear when when I call
There's good and bad, so just be good and stand tall
A lot of people out there wish for me to fall
I'm not scared, I pray to He who hath created us all
Evils and the demons, woo!, I don't stop with them

Verse 1
Whoo!
You're still taking what's not yours
Greedy though you got more
Switching on me now
Snitching on me now
Picking up dirty attitudes
What's yuh future?
Then I'm not sure
Now you lurks on every corner
Trying to make a dollar from dem quarters
Thought you were my friend
Give yuh a helping hand
Proved to be my enemy you can't even trust anyone
Chorus
I've got to take myself away
From all these things that's hurting me
I've got to make my life so free
Seems you don't want nothing good for real (x2)
Verse 2
I waste no time on you
Not behaving yourself having a crime on you
Now there's a fine on you
Now tell me what you gon' do?
Willing to help you and I don't want you to see
The stupid things you do I just can't believe
Seems you don't know what you really need
Take heed remember
Life here isn't so sweet
I was there to motivate you
Seems you don't appreciate it
What is it that generate you?
To do the bad things you do I really hate it
Chorus (x1)
Verse 3
The world is getting dangerous
Sickeness and disease so very contagious
All these bad things happening just ain't for us
Can't help us out, can you pray for us?
I've got to protect my life
I've got love myself
My heart cries within me
Love and respect that's what you should be giving me
When you hate each other you don't know what you're doing to me
If I ah love this fi replenish surely ruling me

Oh mi Lord, be my shield
I ask of Thee
I know they still have some evil purpose in mind, hahaha
Wanna hurt me...
Oh yes
Cho!

I'm not sure if I will live to see tomorrow
Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows
Bodies lay cold as gunmen strike bold
And the wicked people work is taking off like an arrow
I wonder if I will see tomorrow
Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows
Bodies lay cold as gunmen strike bold
And wicked people work is taking off...

I'm not afraid to die, but 'fraid to live until death
It's not hard for you to guess what will happen next
Heartaches and pain, works of ungodliness
Some no know why dem a live, that's when dem have to hurt the flesh
But, who are they? Tell me what they represent
I struggle with fear as I experience
How dem do dem dirty works to which Jah, He resent
And no one, but dem, ago face the consequence
They've build walls instead of bridges, it's ridicule
Then war with whom they live, like a fool
But if I trod the wrong road, away I want to pull
Because the vessel of the iniquity never yet full
Cho...
I wonder if I will live to see tomorrow
Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows
Bodies lay cold as gunmen strike bold
And wicked people work is taking off like an arrow
I wonder if I will see tomorrow
Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows
Bodies lay cold as gunmen strike bold
And wicked people work is taking off, oh yes

That burning concern is no longer there
They're filled with the medicine weh Babylon prepare
Instruments of cruelty present everywhere
Strong enough to take the life, but not enough to care
As the road gets dark I expect anything
I know not my enemies, so it leave me wondering
Many life was lost, who is the next victim?
It could be you, it could be I to how dem set the system
Dem kill without a cause, what is the meaning?
Cho...
No one knows what tomorrow may bring

I'm not sure if I will live to see tomorrow
Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows
Bodies lay cold as gunmen strike bold
And the wicked people work is taking off like an arrow
I wonder if I will see tomorrow
Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows
Bodies lay cold as gunmen strike bold
And the wicked people work is taking off...
Oh Lord, they are filled with corruption and selfishness
Overload with bitterness and wrath
So I have to seek to keep myself away from the wicked on the roads they walk
Oh yes, dem sow seeds of conflict
Dem waan fi see me trip
But that nah go fester my heart
Because I dwell inna Jah sight
And do what is right
Don't want it to be said that I never play my part
I deride with enemies and I am my brother's keeper
What have I done? Dem no waan fi see me prosper
Push on this load as they make it heavier
Jah! It's only sorrow the wicked have to offer

I wonder if I will see tomorrow
Living in this world of...world of...
Cho!
I wonder if I will see tomorrow
Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows
Bodies lay cold as gunmen strike bold
And the wicked people work is taking off like an arrow
I wonder if I will see tomorrow
Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows
Bodies lay cold as gunmen strike bold
And the wicked people work is taking off...
I'm not afraid to die, but 'fraid to live until death
It's not hard for you to guess what will happen next
Heartaches and pain, works of ungodliness
Some no know why dem a live, that's when dem have to hurt the flesh
But, who are they? Tell me what they represent
I struggle with fear as I experience
How dem do dem dirty works to which Jah, He resent
And no one, but dem, ago face the consequence
Dem build walls instead of bridges, it's ridicule
Then war with whom they live, like a fool
But if I trod the wrong road, away I want to pull
Because the vessel of the iniquity never yet...

I'm not sure if I will see tomorrow
Living in this world of conflicts and sorrows
Bodies lay cold as gunmen strike bold
And the wicked people...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
