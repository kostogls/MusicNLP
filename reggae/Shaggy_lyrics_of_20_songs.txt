Yo, man
Yo
Open up, man
Yo, what you want, man?
My girl just caught me
You made her catch you?
I don't know how I let this happen
With who?
The girl next door, ya know?
Man
I don't know what to do
Say it wasn't you
Alright

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

How ya fi give the woman access to your villa?
Trespasser and a witness, all the hacklin' a yuh pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killa
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player, you haffi know how fi play
If she say, "A night," convince her, say, "A day"
Never admit to a word weh she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, "Baby, no way!"
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?

Mek she know say that she really no have right fi vex
A never you she see yah make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else weh favor you inna di complex
Seein' is believin', so you better change your specs
You know she a go bring a whole heap a things up from the past
All the likkle evidence, you betta know fi mask
Quick 'pon yuh answer, know how fi talk
But if she pack a gun, you know you betta run fast
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wa-wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin', it makes no sense at all
Need to tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player, but you're completely lost
That's why I sing
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me79EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Uh, wow, uh, hm, ya, SHAGGY!
Uh, yeah
This one goes out to all my women
My strong women
Uh
So amazing how this world was made
I wonder if God is a woman
The gift of life astounds me to this day
I give it up for the woman
She's the constant wind that fills my sails
Oh, that woman
With a smile and a style
She'll protect you like a child
That's a woman
Chorus:
She'll put a smile upon your face
And take you to that higher place
So don't you underestimate
The strength of a woman
The strength of a woman
Woke up this morning
Got up with the scent of a woman
So picture if you would what life would be
... ain't much good without a woman
She can nag and be a constant pain
Oh, that woman
But those hips
She's got me whipped
And it's just too hard to resist
What a woman
Chorus:
She'll put a smile upon your face
And take you to a higher place
So don't you underestimate
The strength of a woman
The strength of a woman
Tender lips that's so so sweet
Gentle words she softly speaks
Such an angel when we meet
God bless the ground beneath her feet
She can take you on a high
Be your comfort when you cry
But if you look into her eyes you'll see
The strength of a woman
The strength of a woman
Chorus:
She'll put a smile upon your face
And take you to a higher place
So don't you underestimate
The strength of a woman
The strength of a womanEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yes Costi, Yes Mr. Lover
Omi - Shaggy

Girl, you must be sent from above
You keep me warmer than a winter glove
Your smile colorful like flowers in the spring
So me have fi make a toast to your ting, ting, ting
I never meant to fall for your love
I know you're all I'm thinking of
This is more than a summer fling
It's only right that I put on the ring, ring, ring

Said if you left my sight
I won't be okay
Like it's the last time
Love me right through every season
(Through every season - me gal we have fi reason)
There ain't no reason you can't stay
(For every season)

Right through every season
Right through every season
Right through every season

Girl, you bring me up just like the sun on the horizon
And even when it rains I'm enlightened
How you're so sexy and you waist a swing
I'm in love fi watch you when you do your ting, thing, thing
Girl, you make me heart skip a beat
And any time you no near, me no sleep
Feel like the leaves when they drop off the limbs
Me can’t loose you, so me put on the ring, ring, ring

In a world, in a world without, without your love
I don't think I'd be able to breathe
Out of memories when I should be dreaming

Said if you left my sight
I won't be okay
Like it's the last time
Love me right through every season
There ain't no reason you can't stay

Right through every season
I'm loving, I'm loving you like every, yeah

That's better than you and I

I remember, wasn't so long ago
We had a one room shack and the livin' was low
And my mama by herself raised me and my bro
Wasn't easy, but we did it with the little that go
Worked hard, got us up for school every day
And kept her eyes on the stars when the skies were gray
Gave us pride to survive, really showed us the way
Now I really understood what she was tryin' to say

She said, "Son there'll be times when the tides are high
And the boat may be rocky, you can cry
Just never give up
You can never give up," uh-uh
In this life you could lead if you only believe
And in order to achieve what you need
You can never give up
You can never give up

And this hope
That keep me holding on
On and on
And this hope
That makes me carry on
On and on
Boom-boom, couldn't have made it alone
I got a wonderful life, two kids on my own
With a strong foundation that was carved in stone
And my mama for the love that made my house a home
Made me wonder some time if this was meant to be
All this for a humble little guy like me
And all I ever really wanted was a family
To teach my kids the same value that she gave to me

She said, 'Son there'll be times when the tides are high
And the boat may be rocky, you can cry
Just never give up
You can never give up,' uh-uh
In this life you could lead if you only believe
And in order to achieve what you need
You can never give up
You can never give up

And this hope
That keep me holding on
And on
And this hope
That makes me carry on
On and on
We nah turn no stepper, things a go better
Never let yourself be overcome by pressure
Cool yah me bredda, have faith instead a
Sid-dung and a watch and all a fight one another
Blaze like fire,we nah go retire
God nah sleep and a within him we inspire
We have to reach higher for what we require
We have to make our mark before the time expire

And this hope
That keep me holding on
And on
And this hope
That makes me carry on
On and on
And this hope
That keep me holding on
And on
And this hope
That makes me carry on
On and on

There's hope, yeah
Hope keeps it alive, yeah, uh
Hope keeps it alive, yeah, uh
And it strikes an iron, uh
Hope keeps it alive, yeah, yeah
Hope keeps it alive, yeah
Only the strong survive, yeah
Keep it carry on, keep it carry on, yeah
Uh-uh
I'll keep it carry on, yeah
I gotta carry on, gotta carry on and be strong

Watch how you a flex and watch the moves you meck
Careful of the people you disrespect

Cause when you coming down they might not wanna treat you right
And when you coming down that's when you gonna get the fight
And now your wishing that you were a little more polite
And now the table turn and everything a come to light

It's no coincident the people you meet
You haffi careful how you move in the street
The same man you pass when you going up
When you coming down, him a laugh and a grin him teeth
Grandma say today for you, tomorrow for me
That's when you have to face your real sorrows for real
I know you wish you never burn your bridges
But who cyaa hear haffi feel
A cyaa believe yo burn it, yo burn it, a weh you a go walk
When you haffi cross the river in a dark
You burn it, you burn all your bridges in the past
Now your future lead you to the same path

It's a mad mad world that we're living in
Gotta keep your heads up high, can't be giving in
Don't you let one day go by without praising the most High

Rough life, nuff crime, youth them a do hard time
No guides, no sign, walking on a thin line
Sentenced, no trial, victim of a profile
No hope, more fight, wonder why we're hostile
False prophet make profit, focused on them pocket
White collar false docket, door open, can't lock it
Politics, polytricks, equal econometricks
(Where is the justice?)
Death toll rising, sex commercializing
Barely surviving, future jeopardizing
No compromising, hope paralyzing
Rules need revising, why is it surprising?
Got to heed the warning, see the storms are forming

Government spending, who are they defending?

Step back, retrack, notice where your life's at

Got to heed the warning, see the storm that's forming

Mr. Worldwide
Let's show the world how powerful love it
(Now we spread love around the world)

Round and round and round we go
Waiting for the wind to blow
As we walk this world alone
Only love can bring us home
Waving powerless and blind
But tomorrow, we'll be kind
Let love guide us through the rain
Forget our yesterday

Only love, love, love
Brings us together
Only love, love, love
Love, forever
Only love, forever and ever
Only love, love, love
Love, forever
Only love can conquer all and move mountains
When you cold, only love makes you warm again
Only love heals a broken heart, we been through
It all girl, came through the storm again
Find your joy, let go of the past
Love invade your walls like the Trojan horse again
Can't give up, won't give in, find the strength from within
Ask yourself, can you lose my heart again?
I know you're hurting but baby let my love set you free
I'll never let you fall, let's go, girl you can trust in me
Forever in my eyes, you will always be the one for me
I'll always love you until they read out my eulogy

Only love, love, love
Brings us together
Only love, love, love
Love, forever
Only love, forever and ever
Only love, love, love
Love, forever

Love heals all, love kills war
I love the hustle but I love you more
Ride or die that's what love is for
Believe it or not, God loves us all
When I was down and out
You were down with me
Things got deep, you'd drown with me
If there was heat, I know you'd cock back
Click, clap, spit a round with me
Blow a pound with me, hold it down with me
To all them haters, they can come get and me
It's us against the world, 150 I love Miami
That's my city, 305
It's all good, all good
Love is love, love is love
Shaggy, Pitbull, dale
It's all on us
Only love, love, love
Brings us together
Only love, love, love
Love, forever
Only love, forever and ever
Only love, love, love

Round and round and round we go
Waiting for the wind to blow

Only love can bring us home

It's a summertime affair
Shaggy ha
Ravyon
Sun and fun in the
Atmosphere, oh yes

In the summertime when
The weather is high
You can stretch right up
And touch the sky
When the weather is fine
You've got women
You've got women
On your mind
I'm gonna drive and ride and
See now what I can find
Now if her daddy's rich
Take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor
Then do as you feel
Speedin down the lane even
Though the speed limit's twenty five
And when the sun goes down
I'll make it with my cutie pie
Weh me say
Pretty little women
Sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey
Sting like bumble bee
Shaggy say
Pretty little women
Sexy as can be
Sweet as honey
Sting like bumble bee
It's a summertime affair
In a the atmosphere
I man love off her attire
And the clothes she wear
Some burn off them with tyre
And a draw down a gear
Some a shine up wax up
Not a sign of snare
Got to be rolling in my
Christas so the girl them stare
This is Shaggy and Rayvon
As your ultimate pair
Taking care of our career
So tell the world beware
Cause it's a brand new
Selection for your musical ear
We say what we want and
We say what we need
And we love everybody
But we do as we please
And when the weather is fine
We go fishin' we
Go fishin' in the sea
We are happy to live life
That's our philosophy
Now if her daddy's rich
Take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor
Just do as you feel
Speedin down the lane even
Though the speed limit's twenty five
And when the sun goes down
I'll make it with my cutie pie

Sweat a run off her body
With her caramel skin
I man smiled at her she
Looked at me and gave me a grin
I offered her a drink she said
Juice and Gin
And I whispered in her ear
I asked how you doin
Where was it that I reside
And I told her Brooklyn
Atmosphere filled with romance
Her eyes sparkling
Just her voice and what
She said let my poor head spin
Raggamuffin Shaggy
With a musical swing
I say
Pretty little woman
Sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey
Sting like bumble bee
Shaggy say

Shaggy, Cartel remix
Nucci Rayo
Now picture this I'm bucknaked on the bathroom floor
Hittin' Aaliyah raw, Henney-ed up, Mya seen it all
Same reason Kim and Foxy ain't speakin' no more
And why Britney and Christina didn't speak at the awards
Keys in the door, I heard a noise
I didn't get up
Next thing you know Destiny's Child split up
But yo I'm Cris-ed up, got Monica in Miami
Soon as Kobe get married
I'll be back with Brandy

How you fi hav yuh woman access a yuh villa?
Trepass and a witness up inna 'you pilla
Yuh betta watch your back before she turn into a killa
Interview the situation or she call The Gleaner
To be a true playa you fe know how fe play
If she say a nite, convince her seh a day
Never admit to a word wat she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, baby no way
1 - (Shaggy)
Yo but she caught me on the counter
(It wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa
(It wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower
(It wasn't me)
I even had her in the Range Rover
(It wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my should
(It wasn't me)
And here's the words that I told her
(It wasn't me)
She heard the screams gettin' louder
(It wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over
2 - 
Honey came in and she caught me redhanded
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both buck naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

Mek she know seh, dat she neva hav' no right fe vex
A never yuh seh see, a mek the gigalo flex
A somebody else whey favor yuh in de complex
See is believing so yuh betta change yuh specs
Yuh know she a go bring a whole heap a tings up from de past
All the likkle evident you betta know fi mask
Quick pon yo' answer, know how fi talk
But if she pack a gun, yuh know yuh betta run fast
Repeat 1

Uh-huh that's my story and I'm stickin' to it
What you seen and heard, I ain't admitting to it
It wasn't' me, you wanna call me liar, flattin' my tires
Seein' how you play goin' through my two way
You wanna tear my Polos
I can't stand it when you rig up them four doors
From Miami, me and Shaggy in the Caddi
Plus mami with the fatti
Told me, meet her backstage
Talkin' bout she need it badly
I never met her, never seen her
What you talkin' bout?
Bathroom tryna catch us when I'm walkin' out
Dressing room on the floor, on the table too
I'm telling you it wasn't me, it was Don Pooh
Repeat 2
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me
Repeat 2
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
