Silhouette

Took a walk and passed your house late last night
All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight
From within the dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade
Oh, what a lovely couple they made

Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes

Put his arms around your waist and held you tight
Kisses I could almost taste, in the night
Wondering why I'm not the man whose silhouette's on the shade
I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes

Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes

It's true (Oh, yeah)
Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore
Let me in or else I'll beat down your door
When two strangers who had been two silhouettes on the shade
Said to my shock, "You're on the wrong block"

Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes

Must come to your house with wings on my feet
Loved you like I'd never loved, you my sweet
Thought that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days, two silhouettes

Oh I wake up in the morning
With my hair down in my eyes and she says "Hi"
And then I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are going off to school goodbye
She reaches out and takes my hand
Squeezes it and says "How ya feeling, hon?"
And then I look across her smiling lips
That warms my heart and see my morning sun
And if that's not loving me
Then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
There's no such thing as Doctor Seuss
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when my self is feeling low
I think about the face aglow that ease my mind
Sometimes I call her up at home knowing she's busy
Ask her to get away bring me back some bite to eat
She drops what she's doing and she hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late
But she sits waiting patiently, smiles when she first sees me
Cause she was made that way
And if that ain't loving me
Then all I've got to say

It don't rain in Indianapolis when the wintertime
