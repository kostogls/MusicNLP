She doesn't want me around
She's got something to hide
I think she wants a clown
Someone to take for a ride
But I keep telling her

I'm too experienced to be taken for a stroll
Too experienced for someone to rock and roll
I'm too experienced to be taken for a ride
And I know it's not my foolish pride

She hates the sight of me
Because I turned her offer down
She's always saying we were meant to be
Somehow she thought I'd be her clown
But this is what I said


She doesn't want me around
She's got something to hide
I think she wants a clown
Someone to take for a ride
This is what I said

Whoaaaa

I can see so many hypocritism
Everyone are talking this and talking that
Watching how I cook my pot Jah Jah
They always say I'm doing the right thing
And behind me they try to su-su-su-sue unna me
I want to show them that I'm the rasta man
To make the people know my culture
So you see, I've got to stand up on my feet
I've got to carry out my work
Every man got a talent, I got my talent
I've got to show them what it's all about
I've got to say Rastafari

All I can see so many hypocritism
Man and man just fighting against their brother
And if I don't make sure that I'm around the right side
I have to beg Jah for forgiveness
If I cook dumpling Jam-Town gone tell me speak
They always think of me and I don't see them
But one thing more, I've got to control
Excuse me while I smoke my spliff
So you see
You've got a little time to sniff
All I've got is good, good Sensi love
To give you baby, it's just that all I see..
I know well was ???? and me
So many watchy-watchy and beep-beeping at me
All I have seen so many hypocritism
Everyone should show the way
No man should never watch my business
You shouldn't do good things to me to see
I know a man could understand1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh....na..na..na...
(Verse 1:)
I tried my best - never to stop love you
To be there for you, oh
You make my life so miserable
Jealousy and problems, coming to our lifes
We've been together for so long
And we've been through so much
(Chorus:)
Try to do right
But everything I do, seems to go wrong
If I didn't love you baby
I'll be long gone
I need you now, I need you to be strong
Be strong, be strong, be strong
Oh....na..na..na...
(Verse 2:)
Everytime I go out, she always accuse me
Smelling me and telling me, who's perfume is that
Why don't you trust me, you know I'm always faithfull
I'm only looking at the girl, but babs I don't touch
We've been together for so long
And we've been through so much
(Chorus:)
Try to do right
But everything I do, seems to go wrong
If I didn't love you baby
I'll be long gone
I need you now, I need you to be strong
Be strong, be strong, be strong
Oh....na..na..na...
We've been together for so long
And we've been through so much
(Repeat Chorus:)
Try to do right
But everthing I do, seems to go wrong
If I didn't love you baby
I'll be long gone
I need you now, I need you to be strong
Be strong, be strong, be strong
Oh....na..na..na...

I don't know where they go
Where they go

Where are the children of men?
Questions that we did not know (Did not know)
When will we see them again?
Questions that we did not know (That we did not know)

For queens and kings and shining things they gave our souls
But they soon learned that freedom's better than gold, oh (Better than gold)
Inna the days of old (Inna like the days of old)
These are the tales untold

Send for the servant of truth
For all of their sins we bleed (Sins we bleed)
The world will deliver the youts
That's why they never let them read (They never let them read)

A prince, a king will rise and sing to seize their souls
As the world turns, the freedom is better than gold (Better than gold)
Inna the days of old (Inna the days of old)
These are the tales untold
My God, my one salvation
My story, my foundation
My life and all creation
'Cross the mountain over the sea

For what was then will rise again to seize our souls
And they will learn that freedom's better than gold, oh (Better than gold)
Inna the days of old (Inna the days of old)
Ooh, these are the tales untold

Watch dem, watch dem, watch dem erase and burn
Our place in history
We have to come re-educate and learn
Our names for all to see

Those kings and queens will be revealed within our souls
As the world turns, the freedom is better than gold (Better than gold)
Inna the days of old (Inna the days of old)
These are the tales untold
Inna the days of old

But they soon learn that freedom's better than gold, oh (Better than gold)

{*Barack Obama victory speech*}
"It's the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor
Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American..."

We don't make, we don't make war
If you deal with war, backwards stay far
We're dealing with truths and rights come some more into my sight
Whether you a pimpy or livin right
See all I'm tryna do is just get on with my life
The children are the future, so give them a try...
Whoooooaaaa-aaa!!
We have something for the people!
Busta Rhymes! (ayy!) Barrington Levy!
Mi seh! We have something new ya know!
Stop the senseless killing, trample the war
Hey you people your backs against the walls
The way that we're living we're bound to get a fall
Why can't we get together and tear down the walls?
{Obama}
"...who still wonders if the dream of our founders
Is alive in our time; who still questions the power
Of our democracy, tonight is your answer..."
A know one a we, a know two a we
A know three a we, inna dis ya family AYY!
Touch one a we, then you haffi touch the whole a we (Mr. Levy!)
Inna dis ya family AYY! (Bussa-Bus!)

Lemme talk to the people...
See I promise if you violate we coming just to lock off
The barricades of the borough, get your hand chopped off
And probably peel your top off
And pop off the ratchet right in the middle of silence
We don't advocate no violence
But if you're tryna to cross that unforgiving territory once son
And touch my family I will be abducting your loved ones
Like we in the club come, we love to hear the people shout (AHH-WOO!)
It's nothing to tear it down but I'd rather take the peaceful route
Now done with the war, we woulda love it if people screamin it out
You ain't talking about living right, then tell me what are you speaking about
Rhyming and refocused watch the look up on your face-na-na-NA!
And spread a little love, whole heap-a people inna di place-na-na-NA!
See everytime we step in the function we do it proper
It's Busta Rhymes and Barrington Levy, you better call the doctor
We keep it cool but don't forget, you don't wanna spar with us
We're very peaceful but relentless, you don't really want no war with us!
{Obama}
"It's been a long time coming, but tonight
Because of what we did on this day, in this election
At this defining moment, change has come to America..."

A know one a we, a know two a we
A know three a we, inna dis ya family AYY!
Touch one a we, then you haffi touch the whole a we
Inna dis ya family AYY!

Some man dem come fi buss dem gun, shoot dem Glock
But Kardinal come fi bun bad mind, erase that talk
The time is now to recognize what's in the street, what's on the turf
My whole family, told me that I'm king of the Earth
But you earn your royalty, you can't steal or lie for it
If it ain't about my fam I ain't ready to die for it
Money's just a likkle ting, buss for your rights
Police BUSS into my mom's house in the middle of the night
Told me put my hands to the sky, beg for your life
I told em shoot if you want but leave the kids and the wife
As I looked to the floor I saw the nine within reach
But if I do what I'm thinking then who's left to teach?
My people, my community, there's no immunity
War's spreading like the plague, discouraging unity
So I pray through the skylight for Jah Jah to bless
We under stress, but intelligence and "One Love" is how we progress
Yesssss!
{Obama}
"Americans have sent a message to the world
That we have never been just a collection of individuals
Or a collection of red states and blue states;
We are, and always will be, the United States of America..."

A know three a we, inna dis ya family AYY!
Touch one a we, then you haffi touch the whole a we
Inna dis ya family AYY!
Cause We don't make, we don't make war
If you deal with war, backwards stay far
If you deal with truth and rights come some more into my sight

Went away to a far far land, spent some time in New York
Most of my time inna England, no welcome back to my bornland
Come from england to make some vibes, just to keep my fans alive
But the vibes they're teaching me, that dont right in my book, No
Yes the vibes they're teaching me, that dont right in my book, Like
No put de day nah put dem no weh, no put de day lawd I went dem a stay
Sex an guns jus keep dem to de ground horse tonic a mek de girls dem panic
Teach de youths dem how to live, Teach de youths dem how to survive
Hold your corner and save your life and thats no jive
Some of de youths dem make a living by selling some stones
While some make a living wiping down cars
Can't you see the times your living in? the people are suffering
Don't teach me nothing just teach me something
Don't teach me nothing just teach me something
Hold your corner save your life and thats no jive
My heart, my poor little heart, my heart cries to see the youth
No put de day nah put dem no weh, no put de day lawd I went dem a stay
Sex an guns jus keep dem to de ground horse tonic a mek de girls dem panic
Teach de youths dem how to live, Teach de youths dem how to survive
Hold your corner and save your life and thats no jiveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
