It's my master's will, I see the sun shining today
Don't know what is going to bring
You see I give thanks, come what may
Of my missal master, I should thankfully receive
Ain't gonna sit down here crying, worrying going on free
I give a little here, I give a little there and keep a little for myself
Life is so unfair, yet is good to share when you trying to help someone else
Never see the breeze behind the air
You couldn't hold who you calling for and there's nothing you can do
Everything is a one world's often view
I give a little here, I give a little there and keep a little for myself
Life is so unfair, yet is good to share, but it's nice to help someone else
Bring the bread, a sip of tea, a fish for you and a fish for me
I guess there's nothing you can do, everything is a one world's often view
It's my master's will, I see the sun shining today
Don't know what is going to bring
You see I give thanks, come what may
Of my missal's master I shall thankfully receive
Ain't gonna sit down here, crying, worrying on free
I give a little here, I give a little there and keep a little for myself
Life is so unfair, yet is good to share, and it's nice to help someone else
Never see the breeze behind the air
You couldn't hold who you calling for and there's nothing you can do
Everything is a one world's often view
I give a little here, I give a little there and keep a little for myself
Life is so unfair, but is good to share, and it's nice to help someone else
It's my master's will, I see the sun shining today
Don't know what is going to bring
You see I give thanks for what's coming to me
I give a little here, I give a little there and keep a little for myself
Life is so unfair, but is good to share and it's nice to help someone else
I give a little here, I give a little there and keep a little for myself
Life is so unfair, but is good to share and it's nice to help someone else

Run bredda puss, bredda dog after you
Tell me what you really gonna do

The cat chased the mouse
While the dog raced the cat around the corner
The vultures are waiting to see the great slaughter
So they can fly down and clean up after
While the big guys sit up over yonder having all the laughter
While they laugh
Sipping champagne
Having all the best of wine
They assemble to mess up your mind
I ah oh ya
What you gonna do now?
Do now

They always try to do to us the things that are wrong
But we’ll forever be, forever strong

You with your ego, glutness a greecly, won't achieve it
Telling Jah people that you cam
When you are just in for the sham
Me say whoa, them blasphemers. / Their plan is to destroy you
You watch them, them blasphemers
Falling angels, them hypnotize you
They just want to be the leaders
TO divide, confuse the readers
Having a form of Godliness on the outside
But they are full of wickedness on the inside
Say them can fool some people sometimes
But they can't fool Jah people in this time
But true we know Jah low is right
Children stand up in Jah light
Failing angel in the garden to make you go wrong
Hypocrite is in the garden, it won't he for long
They don't care who they trample
They are the worst example-
They just want to reach the top
They don't care about the flock
They creep into your area / With their devilish behavior
Poisoning the minds of Jah children
Destructive force-Jah will defuse them
