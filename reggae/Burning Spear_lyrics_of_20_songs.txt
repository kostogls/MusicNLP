Marcus Garvey's words come to pass
Can't get no food to eat
Can't get no money to spend, Wo-oo-oo
Can't get no food to eat
Can't get no money to spend, Woo -oo- oo
Come, little one and let me do what I can do for you
And you, and you alone
Come, little ones come, wo-oo-oo
Let me do what I can do for you, and you alone, woo-oo-oo

He who knows the right thing and do it not
Shall be spanked with many stripes
Weeping and wailing and moaning
You've got yourselves to blame, I tell you
Do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, I beg you
Tell you to do right, Woo -oo- oo
Beg you to do right, Woo -oo- oo


Where is Bagawire? He's nowhere to be found
He can't be found
First betrayer who gave away Marcus Garvey
Son of Satan, First prophesy
Catch them, Garvey old
Catch them Garvey, catch them Woo -oo- oo
Hold them Marcus, hold them Woo -oo- oo

Do you remember the days of slavery?
Do you remember the days of slavery?
And how they beat us
And how they worked us so hard
And they used us
'Til they refuse us
Do you remember the days of slavery?
And a big fat bull
We usually pull it everywhere
We must pull it
With shackles around our necks
And I can see it all no more
Do you remember the days of slavery?
My brother feels it
Including my sisters too
Some of us survive
Showing them that we are still alive
Do you remember the days of slavery?
History can recall, history can recall
History can recall the days of slavery
Oh slavery days!
Oh slavery days!
While I remember, please remember
Do you do you do you, do you do you do you
