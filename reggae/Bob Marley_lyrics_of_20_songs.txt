 & 
Turn your lights down low
And'a pull your window curtain
Oh let Jah moon come shining in
Into our life again
Saying ooh, it's been a long, long time 
I kept this message for you, girl
But it seem I was never on time
Still I wanna get through to you, girl
On time
On time

I want to give you some love
I want to give you some good, good lovin'
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I want to give you some good, good lovin'
 & (Bob Marley)
Turn your lights down low
Never ever try to resist, oh no
Oh let your love come shinin' in
Into our lives again
Saying: ooh, I love you, (I love you)
And I want you to know right now
Ooh I love you
And I want you to know right now
That I, that I
I wanna give you some love
I wanna give you some good, good lovin'
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I wanna give you some good, good lovin'
Pre - Hook : Lauryn Hill
Loving you is a like a song I replay
Every three minutes and thirty seconds of every day
And every chorus was written for us to recite
Every beautiful melody of devotion every night
This potion might, this ocean might carry me
In a wave of emotion to ask you to marry me
And every word, every second, and every third
Expresses a happiness more clearly than ever heard
And when I play ‘em, every chord is a poem
Telling the Lord how grateful I am cause I know him
The harmonies possess, a sensation similar to your caress
If you asking then I'm telling you it's yes
Stand in love, take my hand and love Jah bless
Right, right

I want to give you some good, good loving
Turn your lights down low
And-a pull your window curtains

And let Jah love come tumbling in
Into our lives again

Sayin’, it’s been a long, long time
I got this message for you, boy

But it seems I was never on time

Still I wanna get through to you, boy

On time
On time
I want to give you some love
I want to give you some good, good lovin'
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I wanna give you some good, good lovin’

Good, some good, good, good, good, good, good

I want to give you some good, good lovin'

Good, good
Oh I, oh I
I wanna give you some good, good lovin’
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Yeah
Please don’t forget passionate
Babies in the bassinet
You call, we be ready
Ha ha, Ma steady
Yeah, yes

Don't you look at me so smug
And say I'm going bad
Who are you to judge me
And the life that I live?

I know that I'm not perfect
And that I don't claim to be
So, before you point your fingers
Be sure your hands are clean

Judge not
Before you judge yourself
Judge not
If you're not ready for judgement (Woah, oh-oh)

The boat of life is rocking
And you may stumble too
So, while you talk about me
Someone else is judging you

Judge not
Before you judge yourself
Judge not
If you're not ready for judgement (Woah, oh-oh)
The road of life is rocky
And you may stumble too
So, while you talk about me
Someone else is judging you

But only a few are chosen
Look at that
Nothing they can do
To separate I and I from the law of our father
Look at that

A woman she loves me with all of her heart
Swear by many powers, we could never part
Since Ive left shes acting strange
Everything is changed, nothing remain the same
Call me, she used to call me bya
She used to call me, oh da
She working down, down town somewhere as a clerk
I know she had lots of potentials
Didnt have to prove no one or show her credentials

Black Thought from the legendary Foundations
Sendin' this one out to the people, knah I mean?
My peoples in the streets of Illadel
The streets of New York City, know what I'm sayin'?
The streets of Jamaica to the ghettos of London
Word up, peoples in the struggle in ???, Cuba, South Africa
Word up, worldwide, Roots crew
And yo, open your minds to this one, feel it
Feel this joint, for real
Uh yo yo yo

This morning I woke up in a curfew
O God, I was a prisoner too, yeah!
Could not recognize the faces standing over me
They were all dressed in uniforms of brutality, ay!
How many rivers do we have to cross
Before we can talk to the boss? ay!
All that we got, it seems we have lost
We must have really paid the cost

That's why we gonna be burnin' and a-lootin' tonight
I said we're gonna burn and a-loot
Burnin' and a-lootin' tonight
One more thing
Burnin' all pollution tonight
Oh yeah, yeah
Burnin' all illusion tonight
Oh stop them, stop them, stop them
Give me the food and let me grow
Let the Roots Man take a blow, ay!
I said all them, all them drugs gon' make you slow
It's not the music of the ghetto

We gonna be burnin' and a-lootin' tonight
(Said we're gonna burn and a-loot)
Burnin' and a-lootin' tonight
One more thing

Yo y'all know the time
I'm tryin' to eat in '99, I need more
Some takin' this to the streets right, they want war
The sheriff at the front door, he comin' to hunt y'all
You got these devils at the back door that wanna confront y'all
They want y'all to pass like some type of gun law
They come in the night, then block out every border you can run for
Me, I'mma rocket launcher, a militant monster
I'm self sponsor, light up the mic just like ganja
Black Thought in the flesh, no impostor power hilly
Thorough bred soldiers ain't with the same silly shit that's uncertain Rap
Inside a steel curtain
His net workin' or shoulders, backs, and necks hurtin', for real
So be supreme or just remain a mere person
Yo you can find knowledge of self or keep searchin'
Whoever in the crevices, thirsty, workin'
Beneath the surface y'all know the purpose
Keep the streets burnin' yo
Burnin' and a-lootin' tonight
I said we're gonna burn and a-loot now
Burnin' and a-lootin' tonight
One more thing

But they’re with the sandman can molest ya

Some some villa fits them well all the day
Live the best life we love well all the day
Oh take me, please mercy
