Stealing, stealing, stealing
Stealing, stealing
Stealing in the name of the Lord
My father's house of worship
Has become a den of thieves
Stealing in the name of the Lord
They fed our mothers with sour grapes
And set our teeth on edge
Stealing in the name of the Lord
Strike the hammer of justice
And set my people free
Strike the hammer of justice
Or let my people be
They tell us of a heaven
Where milk and honey flow
Stealing in the name of the Lord
They said, this place called heaven
The rich man cannot go
Stealing in the name of the Lord
Yet the reverend drives a fancy car
Buys everything tax free
The people have to sacrifice
To give in charity
My father's house of worship
Has become a den of thieves

There'll never be no peace
Down here, in babylon
Till all my brothers here
Down here, are free
We no want to be no peace
Down here, in our neighbours land
So all we want is to be free
Like the birds and the bee
Then we can call you brothers
Brothers, we will be
We can break bread together
The way jah wants us to be
We can drink and honey
No wine we need this time
Then you can be my honey
Your daddy won't mind
If you wanna be at peace
Down here, in babylon
Could you help to give us back
Our rights, or try!
Why don't you daughter fall in love
With me, am i not a man?
Now all we asking you
Is to make, us free
Then we can call you brothers
