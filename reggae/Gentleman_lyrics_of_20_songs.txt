Große Freiheit, ich suche das Weite
Ein kleines Stück Land auf Big Island, yeah
Vielen Dank an die Zweifler (Yeah)
Alle dachten, so komm'n wir nicht weiter (No)
All die Hasser und Neider
Denn ohne euch wäre ich damals gescheitert (Oh, na, na)

Dem gone - the whole a dem ago regret it one day
Dem gone - so far away

Every day you get up and you wish to have a meal
Now you get a cut and you wish to have it heal
And still you cannot accept that Jah Jah is real
Tell me Mr. Man say whats the deal
You say you have everything sign and seel
Thought you won the case but not you a appeal
You are the one who couldn't hear now you the one to feel
Evidently clear we choppin down your shield

Dem corrupt the east and now dem turn it to the moon
Plant ina your garden and wish that it will bloom
But still you're singing Satan tunes

Dem gone - so far away
Dem gone - the whole a dem ago regret it one day
Mother earth was meant for man and woman to stay
Me find out nuff a dem drifting away
Children can't even find a place fi play
Birds can't find no seeds, horses no hay
I see the weavers weaving but dem income delay
Still me see dem searching for a brighter day
And now me come fi give it to you right away
Do you hear what I say?

Dem gone - so far away
Dem gone - the whole a dem ago regret it one day
Dem gone - so far away
Dem gone - the whole a dem ago regret it one day

Whapen'them?
Give me the mic deh for a moment make me talk to dem
And watch the eden dem a scatter when we walk to dem
And if you know you are not guilty stand up and don't you run
No, no to all my foes and friends
You may live to see today but you nuh know the end
Just read the writings on the wall it's a message we send
And Babylon will never live to stop the rising of Jah son
Well, dem, dem
Dem gone - so far away
Dem gone - the whole a dem ago regret it one day
Dem gone - so far away

Augen zu, Schaukelstuhl, ausgeruht
Viel Zeit statt ausgebucht
Sweet-Life statt Rausch und Blues (Haha)
Freestyle statt Zeitplan
Ich bin jetzt Weltbürger, überall Heimat
Der Weg, er war hart, doch die Zukunft wird einfach
Der Druck wird noch kleiner
Die Last auf den Schultern wird leichter
Irgendwann sagst du dir: „So gut hat es keiner“
Fühlt ihr das? Dann push up your lighter (Push up)

Es gibt keinen anderen Weg um wieder Land zu seh’n
Geh' mit Zuversicht nach vorn (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Hab' die Hoffnung nie verlor’n

Auf all das zurückzuschau'n, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dies ist eine Vorschau auf mein'n Rückblick
Seh' mich schon als Opa mit den Enkeln auf dem Rücksitz
Mit 'ner kleinen Plauze, spielen Boccia
Bei Opas Geschichten
Szenenapplaus, ich bin ein Rockstar
No, no, no, gar kein Sturm und kein Drang
Früher machte mich so wenig happy, heut ein Sonnenuntergang
Leben so genießbar
Freu' mich darauf, dass der Mann im Spiegel zu mir „Peace!“ sagt

If you know not Jah, 'coz God is love

I know Jah, lovin' is superior
Your devil complex inferior, oh yes
Worshiping material
Bowing to your silver and gold
I know Jah, lovin' is superior
Your devil complex inferior, oh yes
Worshiping material
Bowing to your silver and gold

Somebody tell me
'Coz I really got to know, oh, oh
I read a lot of history
But things nuh really show, no, no
Why dem drop the bombs ina Arabia?
Why the children bawl and suffer ina Africa?
Leaders of the world just fighting for superpower
But judgment ago fall upon dem head, like rain shower
Mi go so then
I know Jah, lovin' is supеrior
Your devil complex inferior, oh yеs
Worshiping material
Bowing to your silver and gold
I know Jah, lovin' is superior
Your devil complex inferior, oh yes
Worshiping material
Bowing to your silver and gold
Yazanımız yok çünkü gazeteler yalan
Yazanlarsa hapislerde bilmem kaç gece yatar
Aklı körelmiş boş beyinlilerde sorun
Yahu diyen dahil düzen düzer
Herkes olur mağdur benim istediğim tek şey
Adalet ama uzak bize
Anlamadığım dilde yazılan kanunlar tuzak gibi
Yobazlarla münakaşa ve de mücadele
Yaktılar, çünkü bizi atmıştılar dün ateşe
Aklım almaz düşündükçe hayat hoştu küçüklükte
Görmemiştim bombalanan çocukları üzüldükçe
Zihniyetler nef'se fena düştüler
Fakat kaldılar hep serbest tecavüzcüle-er
Ve sertleşir her dakika şartlar
Artmakta rantlar arlanmaz asla
Hep lak lak yaparlar
Maksat kazanmak ama halktan çalarlar
An meselesi lan bu çakmam sapanla
I know Jah, lovin' is superior
Your devil complex inferior, oh yes
Worshiping material
Bowing to your silver and gold
I know Jah, lovin' is superior
Your devil complex inferior, oh yes
Worshiping material
Bowing to your silver and gold

Open up your eyes and realize then
You Hafi, keep youh Hafi, care you Hafi guide dem
Don't you know war and crime will divide dem?
Now you betta show the youth your fears
And don't you hide dem
And then equality and justice will unite dem
Lift up your voice and you got to sing the anthem
We go so then

I know Jah, lovin' is superior
Your devil complex inferior, oh yes
Worshiping material
Bowing to your silver and gold
I know Jah, lovin' is superior
Your devil complex inferior, oh yes
Worshiping material
Bowing to your silver and goldEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Verse 1:
Homesick for a place you've never seen before
You love life but you can't find a key to it's store
Where is the smile up on your face?
You livin in disgrace
You runnin but dem wrong things you chase yeah
I'm not sayin anything you've never heard before
But i hope this time it's i go reach to your core
And now we can find ways again
To keep things under control
Straight forward no waste time again
Movements got a stone after all
The torch and the light and the flame
The goodness in you to unchain
No more you are livin in vain
Turn another page it won't be the same no
Chorus:
And everybody's journey is their own
If i take a lead and no fallout
Now it's time to get up from the ground
Got to have the strength and no stall out
Verse 2:
And you trying not to see the mess around you
But everyweher you turn it seems to outbound you
In the mixup with the demoms them surround you
There is nothing they can do to stop the love that has found you
Now the light and the truth can go around
Push out to the limit the word power and sound
Now the fears and the doubts will go down
Contagious all over the town
Chorus:
And everybody's journey is their own
If i take a lead and no fallout
Now it's time to get up from the ground
Got to have the strength and no stall out
Verse 3 :
Take the invitation to trouble your soul
Sick of navigation untill you find out your own
It might be unconfortable go ahead and be a rebel
On your hours feel yourself miserable
Now is the time to live life before you go old
There is a fire inside you dont make it go cold
And now we can find ways again
To keep things under control
Straight forward no waste time again
Movements got stone after all
The torch and the light and the flame
The goodness in you to unchain
No more you are livin in vain
Turn another page it won't be the same no
Chorus:
And everybody's journey is their own
If i take a lead and no fallout
Now it's time to get up from the ground
Got to have the strength and no stall outEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Chorus:
(You remember) When we used to write letters and we never used to send text messages
(You remember) When there was no Facebook, no Youtube, never invade the colleges
(You remember) That technology's a good thing but many misuse it and cause peer damages
The future is so great we can't forget the past
I'm passionate about this memory, I got this feeling
Question to the leaders and me ask them what them dealin'
They say that the world need a spiritual healin'
What about the youth that we leavin'?
Cyberspace take their mind only that them a believe in
The elders get bitter so them stop from teachin'
Miles from the youth than how you ever reach them
Tell me how you ever reach them
Bridge:
We remembering the past but if there wasn't the past just remember that there wouldn't be no future
So I say it with all costs on your behalf just like how Christ died for the youths, ya'
That's just a moment in time to mesmerize your mind you better acknowledge the truth, ya'
If your objective is crime you keep being unkind then your own weapon will shoot ya'
Chorus:
(You remember) When we used to write letters and we never used to send text messages
(You remember) When there was no Facebook, no Youtube never invade the colleges
(You remember) That technology's a good thing but many misuse it and cause peer damages
The future is so great we can't forget the past
Certain good things happen in the past
Now everything change, everybody move fast (move fast)
And the youths, me see them act like them lost
Everybody wanna' be a rebel without a cause
You remember when we coulda' hence out
And a roll down south everybody coulda' roll all about
Now the tension so high like it want touch the sky
'Dem a plan now, fi try get you out
Mannerism is depleted, the past is deleted
'Dem fi know life's more than a flaas
And the children used to listen to the teacher
Now the children 'dem a gwaan like 'dem a the teacher of the class
'Dem used to say thank you and good morning
Now not even question a ask
But you can't blame the youth cause they don't know the truth
There is no one to help 'dem stick to the task
Chorus:
(You remember) When we used to write letters and we never used to send text messages
(You remember) When there was no Facebook, no Youtube never invade the colleges
(You remember) That technology's a good thing but many misuse it and cause peer damages
The future is so great we can't forget the pastEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You know I won't forget you
And I will always respect you
Thank you Jah for everything
And I bless the very, very day I met you
'Cause everything have reason
Like every time have season
Things go round in cycle circle
Don't know why, but they can hurt you
The sadness won't fade away
No it won't go away
It's funny how memories don't leave like people do
That's why I have to say
I'm making this point today
It's funny how memories don't leave like people do, noo
If I could go back from where it started
And still could call your name
If I coulda told you before we departed
Now things are not the same
If I could go back from where it started
And still could call your name
If I coulda told you, I wish I coulda told you
I remember when we used to cooperate
We had one aim you never hesitate
And nothing wha me do you nuh underrate
You was a true friend, memories won't evaporate
Tragedy we never anticipate
It's like a dream and yet I am wide awake
Some genuine vibes we generate
And now I'm gonna show you how much I appreciate
If I could go back from where it started
And still could call your name
If I coulda told you before we departed
Now things are not the same
If I could go back from where it started
And still could call your name
If I coulda told you, I wish I coulda told you
We used to share the same dream, same goal
One team, a so we used to roll
No separation, manipulation, allegation
Because you was a very good soul
One aim, one heart, one God
And we used to have the same thought
No limitation to inspiration, motivation
Sadness won't fade away
No it won't go away
It's funny how memories don't leave like people do
That's why I have to say
I'm making this point today
It's funny how memories don't leave like people do, noo
If I could go back from where it started
And still could call your name
If I coulda told you before we departed
Now things are not the same
If I could go back from where it started
And still could call your name
If I coulda told you, I wish that I could have told youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

And I would have been in custody if loving was a crime

Songs and secret letters add up more than to a thousand lines
Ring pon your finger now look how it a shine I'm glad to say

And what's interesting about us we learn to forgive

So much things we've been waiting for

Ich reiß' heut meine Zäune ein
Pflanz' an ihrer Stelle lieber ein paar neue Bäume ein
Wir laden ein paar Freunde ein, heimliche Rebellen
Robin Hood trifft sich mit Familie Feuerstein
Bin hier, draußen ist mein Königreich
Hier wird man gerecht behandelt und ich fühl' mich wirklich frei
Wir gleiten so ins Abendrot
Heb' 'n Stück Erde mit den Spaten hoch

Ich pflanz' 'n Samen in meinem Garten
Lass die Leute reden, lass die Welt 'n bisschen warten
Ohh, hier in meinem Garten
Ich glaub', ich zieh' in meinen Garten
Ich häng' hier schon seit Tagen
Einfach warten, bis die Sachen Früchte tragen
Ohh, hier in meinem Garten
Ich will das Leben nur umarmen

Hängematte, Schmetterlinge, was 'ne schöne Zeit
Die meisten Dinge starten immer winzig klein
Ich will einfach nur noch Sachen wachsen seh'n
Nehm' mir die Zeit und verpass' die Tagesthem'n
Die Kriege in mir werden alle still
Weiß gar nicht mehr, was man da draußen alles will
Blumen sind Graffiti, die Natur fängt an zu sprüh'n
Wusstest du? Es gibt eintausend Töne grün
Ich pflanz' 'n Samen in meinem Garten
Lass die Leute reden, lass die Welt 'n bisschen warten
Ohh, hier in meinem Garten
Ich glaub', ich zieh' in meinen Garten
Ich häng' hier schon seit Tagen
Einfach warten, bis die Sachen Früchte tragen
Ohh, hier in meinem Garten
Ich will das Leben nur umarmen
Ich pflanz' 'n Samen in meinem Garten
Lass die Leute reden, lass die Welt 'n bisschen warten
Ohh, hier in meinem Garten
Ich glaub', ich zieh' in meinen Garten
Ich häng' hier schon seit Tagen
Einfach warten, bis die Sachen Früchte tragen
Ohh, hier in meinem Garten
Ich will das Leben nur umarmenEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
