Skylarking, skylarking
That's what youths do today
Skylarking, skylarking
Before they stand up firm on their feet

Yet a little work, a little work
And earn them bread honestly

Begging you a five cent, sir
Begging you a ten cent, sir
Can not have, no, can not have

So, if you all keep on doing what you all are doing
You will end up, up, up in jails

Begging you a five cent, sir
Begging you a ten cent, sir
Can not have, no, can not have

So, if you all keep on doing what you all are doing
You will end up, up, up in jails
So, if you all keep on doing what you all are doing
You will end up, up, up in jails

Love of a woman is all I can take
Love of a woman is all I can give
That is all

All I can do
The heart of a woman is all I can steal

'Cause I'm a Man

I don't want to, no, I don't want to
Be outside, when Zion gate close
I just want to, yes, I want to
Be inside, when Zion Gate close

'Cause the world is enslaved, millions are lost
Some seeking world power, some vanity
They don't remember Jah
Sadder, inequity, prostitution
Too much wrong-doings, in the sight of Jah

So I don't want to, no, I don't want to
Be outside, when Zion Gate close
I just want to, yes, I want to
Be inside, when Zion Gate close (I don't want to be outside)

Black woman, can't you see what they, are doing to you, oh?
Giving you evil bill, to destroy your nation
You're onto me, though one can teach the children
The wrong-doings
And tell them that it's right
So I don't want to, no, I don't want to
Be outside, when Zion Gate close
I just want to, yes, I want to
Be inside, when Zion Gate close

Yes, I want to

On the first part of the journey, I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sounds
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can't remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La la, la, la, la la la, la la la, la, la
La la, la, la, la la la, la la la, la, la
After two days in the desert sun, my skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun, I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can't remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La la, la, la, la la la, la la la, la, la
La la, la, la, la la la, la la la, la, la
After nine days, I let the horse run free 'cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can't remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La la, la, la, la la la, la la la, la, la
La la, la, la, la la la, la la la, la, la

Ever since you went away
Every day, it's just a cloudy day
And I don't know
If it's rain from the skies
Tears from my eyes, fallin' on my face
And rollin' down my cheek
Since you're gone I live alone
Always in the middle of a storm
And I don't know
If it's rain from the skies
Tears from my eyes, fallin' on my face
And rollin' down my cheek
All I know is I love you, and
If I live forever
I'll be loving you still
You will always be just, everything to me
So, hurry back and bring the sun, let me be
You're one and only one, with just one kiss
Stop the rain from the skies
Tears from my eyes, fallin' on my face

Rollin' down

No I would not give no false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
Oh, little darling of mine, I care for the life of me
Remember a sadder day, that now they say let be
Just don't recount on me in the course of a lifetime run
Over and over again
No I would not give no false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
Oh, little darling of mine, I just can't believe it's so
Though it seems strange to say, I never been laid so low
Such a mysterious way and the course of a lifetime runs
Over and over again
No I would not give no false hope
