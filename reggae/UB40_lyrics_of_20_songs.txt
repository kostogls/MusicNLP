The night seems to fade
But the moonlight lingers on
There are wonders for everyone
The stars shine so bright
But they're fading after dawn
There is magic in Kingston Town

Oh, Kingston Town
The place I long to be
If I had the whole world
I would give it away
Just to see the girls at play

And when I am king
Surely I would need a queen
And a palace and everything, yeah
And now I am king
And my queen will come at dawn
She'll be waiting in Kingston Town

Did I ever say, how I feel about you
A thing I never found that easy to do
The things that you do, don't need to be heard
You know your actions, baby, speak louder than words

I've got the bottle, bring me your cup
Pop the cork, and try a sup
And when you're empty, I'll fill you up
We'll drink it down till the sun comes up
I'm heading home, like a steaming train
Foot to the floor, in the driving rain
My head is aching and my mouth is dry
I've got a thirst only you can satisfy

When we were together
Those were the happiest time in all my life
Now we're separated
I don't know what I will do
'Cause I can't love another
No matter how I try
'Cause I know, it's impossible
Wherever you may be
I hope you'll hear my song
Then maybe you'll realise, my love
That you were wrong
'Cause I can't love another
No matter how I try
'Cause I know, it's impossible
The sunset outside my window
Has lost all it's glow
The rose in the garden, my love
Doesn't bloom any more
Wherever you may be
I hope you'll hear my song
Then maybe you'll realise, my love
That you were wrong
'Cause I can't ever love another
No matter how I try
'Cause I know, it's impossible
The sunset outside my window
Has lost all it's glow

I'm sitting here praying that you weren't just saying
Leaving tomorrow was what you had planned
No point in pretending, I know that it's ending
I just want to know where the ending began
Where did I go wrong to make it like this
No warmth in your body, no touch in your kiss
Holding you now, hurts more than it should
If I let you go, girl, you'll be gone for good
I thought you had saved me, the love that you gave me
The sweetest loving in all of the land
But you've taken my heart, and you've torn it apart
And its crumbled to dust in the palm of your hand
Where did I go wrong to make it like this
No warmth in your body, no touch in your kiss
Holding you now, hurts more than it should
If I let you go, girl, you'll be gone for good
There's nothin' worth sayin', I know you're not staying
Might as well face it, it's out of my hand

I am a one in ten, a number on a list
I am a one in ten, even though i don't exist
Nobody knows me, but im always there
A statistic, a reminder of a world that doesn't care
My arms enfold the dole queue
Malnutrition dulls my hair
My eyes are black and lifeless
With an underprivileged stare
I'm the beggar on the corner
Will no-one spare a dime
I'm the child that never learns to read
Because no one spared the time
I am a one in ten a number on a list
I am a one in ten even though i don't exist
Nobody knows me, but im always there
A statistic a reminder of a world that doesn't care
I'm the murderer and the victim
The licence with the gun
I'm a sad and bruised old lady
In an ally in a slum
I'm a middle aged businessman
With chronic heart disease
I'm another teenage suicide
In a street that has no trees
I am a one in ten a number on a list
I am a one in ten even though i don't exist
Nobody knows me, but im always there
A statistic a reminder of a world that doesn't care
I'm a starving third world mother
A refugee without a home
I'm a house wife hooked on Valium
I'm a Pensioner alone
I'm a cancer ridden spectre
Covering the earth
I'm another hungry baby
I'm an accident of birth

It must have broke your poor little heart
When the boys used to say
You looked better in the dark
But now they'd give all they learnt in school
To be somewhere in the dark with you
The teacher would ask the questions
And you, would always raise your hand
But somehow you never got your turn
And my eyes would fill with water, inside I'd burn

Homely girl, you used to be so lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh homely girl
Homely girl you used to be so lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh homely girl
There was a boy who used to sit beside you
Who'd like to hold that place his whole life through
Oooh you were beautiful to me
You had a heart no one could ever see, oh yes you did
Homely girl, you used to be so lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh homely girl
I was the only one who offered
To carry your books
Took all the stares and laughter
And the dirty looks
Cause I saw then what they see now
They all want to ask you for a date
They don't know how, they don't know how

Ivory Madonna, dying in the dust
Waiting for the manna coming from the west
Barren is her bosom, empty as her eyes
Death a certain harvest scattered from the skies
Skin and bones is creeping, doesn't know he's dead
Ancient eyes are peeping, from his infant head
Politicians argue sharpening their knives
Drawing up their bargains, trading baby lives

Ivory Madonna, dying in the dust
Waiting for the manna coming from the west
Hear the bells are ringing, Christmas on it's way
Hear the angels singing, what is that they say?
Eat and drink rejoicing, joy is hear to stay
Jesus son of Mary is born again today

Ivory Madonna, dying in the dust
Waiting for the manna coming from the west

The sun is fading away
That's the end of the day
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way
Just one kiss and I'll go
Don't hide the tears that don't show
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way
To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way I will go
They were right, I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way
To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way I will go
They were right, I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my wayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

They say we're young and we don't know
Won't find out until we grow
Well I don't know if baby that's true
Cause you've got me baby, I've got you

Babe, I've got you babe
I've got you, babe

They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned our money's always spent
I guess that's so, we don't have a lot
At least I'm sure we've all the things we've got

Babe, I've got you babe
I've got you, babe

I got flowers in the spring
I got you to wear my ring
And when I'm sad, you're around
And when I get scared you're always around
So let them say your hair's too long
I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
Then put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb
Babe, I've got you babe
I've got you, babe
I've got you, babe

I got you to hold my hand
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you and I won't let go
I got you to love me so

I got you, babeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
