Yes I want back dem pictures dem hangs on your wall
For where once the sun rose now night falls
Some may say oh what a blue sky in sight yeah yeah
Well now out of the distance I see lightning strike
I will never hide dem, hide dem all
I could never fear dem, fear dem all
Over there shall come a new light shining in dis here dark
Life
For the Most High dwells with man tonight
See the fountain of Eden flow
Was born out of the hearts of man
Who could not see dem as they pray on dem
Just as war fell upon our land, I do not understand
For who Jah choose is why I, I, I and I & I
Shall bring forth these axes freeing us out of the bondage
And we could finally rest our weary souls
In which we fight the holy wars
Oh, Jah, Jah, knows it's true, in everything that we do
Oh, Jah knows it's true, La da da da
I wanna roll, wanna hide, want to drift away
Beyond these bombs, beyond these walls
Beyond these hypocrites
Oh, but I will never right dem, right dem all
I could never fear dem, fear dem all
Over there shall come a new night shinning in this here dark
Life
For the Most High dwells with man tonight
Down in the valley of Johannesburg cry
Echoes of the tears shed for life
While they refuse to hear they pray on dem
Just as war fell upon our land, I do not understand
Jah choose is why I, I, I and I & I
Shall bring forth these axes freeing us out of bondage
And we could finally rest our weary souls
In which we fight those holy wars
See dem as they come to dis a paradise
We all shall know them who have come to paste a service
Oh I man see them as they come to take a paradise
I know them who have come to hide their
Hearts behind these lies, oh La da da da
And this is all, I've seen today
And this is all, I've seen today
And this is all, I've seen today
Oh yes this is all I've seen Today

Of how the ocean use to be our home

And so the Rasta a leave home

Standing low, challenge the King for the thrown

We cry tears of the Most High
Wondering why they couldn’t love them
Who loved them. Yes I

Mourning for them who use to laugh, for they

They no longer have a faith
They no longer control us by a Judas lie, o-o-oh Jah

From out of the minds and thoughts of our children
Here in desolate places
Oh we give thanks and praises to our elders
For the guidance we are after
Oh we give thanks and praises to our elders
For unto them we know that
No one shall stand alone tonight
Shall run, run tonight, shall stand alone tonight

With visions of fire running red
And so we call upon my elders instead
Don Carlos at the control

Some walk by day and some stalk by night
Oh Rastafari shall greet them in the end
And so de man run up so long, so long, Oh, Lord!

Taken them into the garden of Helam
They back them down in the depths of the sea

When them use to sell children laughing and a talk

They've gone to the mountain to face God
Beg them forgivness for they have forgive us

Call onto the sea which once was my friend

Before you play this round, you should know something, yes
About the thing you are not seein'
Hope him to inspire all the angels of man (A-ah-ah)
A-but you cyan't do it (do it), them alone shall make their fate
Hidden past their makeup, and the diamonds and lights:
A false worship, reflection of them ego trip (them ego trip-yeah) yeah!
Building up their model of stick like puppet
Trying to hide what we see; Jah the defender of beauty


Until the moon and the sun start their focus on we (watchy-watchy)
And the dreams of a child are universally
Nurtured as true shape and form, reflections of we (reflections of we-reflections of we-reflections of we)
Only then will man and woman (man and woman!) be respected equally
Jah know


Just like all her idols, she wants to sparkle and fly (fly-fly-fly)
A-but you never reach it (re-re-reach-it, ah-ah), stuck like in quicksand pit
Feelin' like a failure you want to run off and hide (A-ah-ah)
But you cyan't do it (do it), remembering life is a blessing
Driven by the powers that man has devised (devised-ah-ah)
It's only physical, could never get spiritual
Changing up this model would be our fight (A-ah-ah)
Recalling history; Jah the defender of beauty

Until the moon and the sun start their focus on we, ouu! (watchy-watchy)
And until the dreams of a child are universally
Nurtured as true shape and form, reflections of we (reflections of we, reflections of we, reflections of we)
Only then will man and woman (man and woman!) be respected equally

Until the moon and the sun start their focus on we (watchy-watchy)

Life is hard on the day you go on
Cross this bridge and take it out of here
Know yourselves in terms of light years
Leaving your mark, taking it slow
Singing, singing a song for them to reap and reign
We were planting, planting a seed for them to grow one day
He was writing, writing, writing a spell and it’s still on we
Chanting, chanting out to space but they won’t catch me
Just like Daniel heading out of the lion’s den
When all of his bredrin they all left him for dead
A thousand degrees and it’s gonna get hotter
Who ever thought this battle would be a slaughter house
Where the people rather turn away than see
Happiness is lost, speechless in fear
We were ringing, ringing alarm for them and they awoke angry
Fighting, fighting revolutionary battle still gonna see
We were all flying high, on a super vibe
We were all soaring free the way life should be
Just like Daniel heading straight out of the lion’s den
When all of his bredrin they all left him for dead
He never did talk so people thought him a coward
But he would speak when the final hour drew near
Only three months left to go
Killing your thought, breaking bone
We were singing singing a song for them to rock this place
Chanting, chanting out to them who gonna rule one day
See them casting, casting their spell and it’s still on we
Sending, sending out to space, but they won’t catch me

There was a plan held high up for the young ones
It says, we alone must bring the fruit out of the garden
For this is not just a sign this is our holy water
Well now wa da da da
In a vision of fire I'll fright until the end
So you think you are the only one, well, well, well, well
Who gave my father the strength to cross the ocean
Lord Mother come carry your flock in for the day
Rally round, gather round, oh people in some way
Each One shall Teach One yes
Well until we reach Jah heights oh children bless
Each One shall Teach One yes
Until we reach Jah heights inna future
Each One shall Teach One yes
Yes until we reach Jah heights oh children bless
Each One shall Teach One yes
Lord until we reach Jah heights inna future
In this plan is the knowledge
Of what dwelled before man
So know your history or you will become it
Dear Mother come save your pickney
From the Philistine marching in this time
Oh Father guide them from the Babylonians
Well I man go, down by the river
Yes and I man see, our children deliver me
Well now I man go, down by the river
Yes and I man see, our children deliver me
Some may say "Oh why am I here today?"
Well if you do not know today you will tomorrow
Finding a river flowing deep, deep from within
Rally round, Gather round, everyone run comeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hold dem with the riddim make we drop style
Sekkle pon the riddim make we rocksteady
Oh the riddim hold dem, and dem cyan't complete
Reaching to his soul and causing him to think
Without woman, what would man be?
Like a night without stars. lost at sea
Oh man's got soul but him incomplete
Something in his way of superiority
So with heart, mind and courage like a Lion
Oh in spite of this world still up-full I am
Over the edge man go
Pushed on beyond the rivers that flow
Into this humbled harmony
It's real hard dread but you got to see that
All you dream
Will only come to be
With your, compromising nature
You should be, planting fruits for the future
With great reward for a crook
The world's beginning to look
Just like a pimper's paradise
It's real hard dread but one day you'll see yeah
In this life
You must make sacrifice
And teach your, son and daughter virtue
To see your, son and daughter leading the youth today
Oh the riddim hold dem, and dem heart skip a beat
And once you feel the vibe, will not except defeat
One day a queen come, and sweep him off his feet?
Even the fittest of the fittest was brought forth by a women
Oh man's got pride and a whole lotta brass
If left on his own he would parish fast
But with love and guidance, there is nothing he can't do
True love from a women the whole day throughEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
