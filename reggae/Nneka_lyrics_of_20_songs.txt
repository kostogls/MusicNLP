You said you'd be there for me
In times of trouble when I need you and I'm down
And likewise you need friendship
It's from my side pure love but I see lately things have been changing
You have goals to achieve
But the roads you take are broad and heartless
That wants you make another way
You throw stones
Can you see that I am human I am breathing
But you don't give a damn

Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you see the pain you're causing
Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you see the pain you're causing

Blood blood blood blood
Blood blood blood blood
Blood blood blood blood
Blood keeps rushing

And now the world is asleep
How will you ever wake her up when she is deep in her dreams, wishing
And yet so many die
And still we think that it is all about us
It's all about you
You sold your soul to the evil and the lust
And the passion and the money and you
See the same ones die, people hunger for decades
Suffer under civilized armedrobbers, modern slaveholders
Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you see the pain you're causing
Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you see the pain you're causing

Blood blood blood blood
Blood blood blood blood
Blood blood blood blood
Blood keeps rushing

Evaded, eliminated, erased, interrogated
Our tradition, our love for our fellow countrymen
Our property, our resources - our pride
Can you feel my heart heart beating
No no no no no no no, you don't do

Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you feel the pain you're causing
Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you feel the pain you're causing3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

According to
Psalm 27
Lord is my light and my salvation
Who shall i fear, who shall i fear
Look up in da sky and tell me what is left for us to see
So many mornings that we wake up
No money in the pocket to be
Never stop to take the short cut
Though it might be easier for me
Whenever a thought that is as such
Confronts and recognizes me
I go down on my knees
And pray in the morning
No matter what comes on my knees
I will stay, I keep beseeching
So let the storms come cos I know
That love will conquer everything
And I know that you got me, and I got you
'Cause when we lie, we love
When we die, we love
When we suffer, we love
'Cause when we lie, we love
?
?
'Cause when we lie, we love
When we die, we love
When we suffer, we love
'Cause when we lie, we love

'Cause when we lie, we love
When we die, we love
When we suffer we love
'Cause when we lie, we love
'Cause when we lie, we love
When we die, we love

Naija, in the loud and roudy of my world
There's a secret place where I find myself
Can I find you?
Biafra, the noise of horns of thirsty nigerians
Of hustlers, of mothers confront me as I walk pass
Lagos, in prayer contemplation, like a ghost
I feel the sorrow of a many
Still I do not know how much pain it takes
Naija, I walk the island, I walk the mainland
I see diversity, I smell capacity but still we suffer, why?

I am, the voice of Isaac Boro,
I speak Ken Saro Wiwa
I am, the spirit of Jaja of Opobo
Fight for right, for our freedom
You? A power hungry class of army arrangements
Stealing money in my country’s plight
A soldier pretending to be a politician
You teacher who know nothing
Do not teach me lies

Naija, generators wake from my self pity
No time to waste like okana, really hits
Naija, for too long we have surrendered
To the ignorance of ourself defense in you
We have failed
America, how far must we walk in calamity in suppression
How long would take for you to love Naija
As I sit here I want to live
There are so many plans for you but still I can’t deliver
I am, the voice of Isaac Boro,
I speak Ken Saro Wiwa
I am, the spirit of Jaja of Opobo
Fight for right, for our freedom
You? A power hungry class of army arrangements
Stealing money in my country’s plight
A soldier pretending to be a politician
You teacher who know nothing
Do not teach me lies

Stealing money in my country’s plight
You’re stealing money in my country’s plight

Great mother my respect for you is in depht
My fear od death for you might kill me
Fallen lucifer, percieve wahala
As we embrace you with change
You stay selfish fundamental
Black Africa, we still survive
We still will rise for the world needs us to be America?
This soul is heavy, the little you have left to me
I charge to function in your madness
I am in your madness
I am
I am, the voice of Isaac Boro,
I speak Ken Saro Wiwa
I am, the spirit of Jaja of Opobo
Fight for right, for our freedom
You? A power hungry class of army arrangements
Stealing money in my country’s plight
A soldier pretending to be a politician

Do not teach me lies

Oh no doubt
I am loving you more than I love myself
With your mouth
You stole my soul so I could not love myself
Oh no doubt
I am loving you more than I love myself
With your mouth
You took my soul so and so I cannot love myself

It is Dollars, it is Euros, it is Sullis, it is Pounds, it is Crowns, it is Yens, it is Lyons
Still the clouds are gray, did u want us to believe that u love us, more than u love yourself
We have been waiting, to trust u since, had u praying on blood wounded knees, for u to hear us out
In distress, must confess, you have achieved what is best, for the devil to rule our lives, to ruin this world

Oh no doubt
I am loving you more than I love myself
With your mouth
You stole my soul so I could not love myself
Oh no doubt
I am loving you more than I love myself
With your mouth
You took my soul so and so I cannot love myself
For there was in our minds, our soul, in the world
There are books, there are laws, there is religion, for confusion, for control
Every corner there is dread, there is pain, is there love in the theart of man, for we know what we do

Oh no doubt
I am loving you more than I love myself
With your mouth
You stole my soul so I could not love myself
Oh no doubt
I am loving you more than I love myself

In this madness, in this world
With its swiftness and its coldness
You’re my peace of mind, yes!
When the world just jeeps turning
And I know not where to head to
You’re peace of mind!
And when I look up in the skies
Is the one that you created...
Oh shining star, please look down for me!
Oh, what you are?
When you look down at me
Beautiful star, do keep your eyes on me!
Oh, oh, what you are
When you look down on me?
It's about my greed when they chase me
When your heart strict
Do you love me?
I appreciate you baby!
And though you seem so far away
You pursuit me I can feel you
But did well within my mind
And I know you’re sometimes lonely
Oh, I wish that I could change it
Oh then I know you still got me
And I pray my love will give you life
To help your breathe to give you smile
You’re my shining star, to take my love and live!
Oh shining star, please look down for me!
Oh, what you are?
When you look down at me
Beautiful star, do keep your eyes on me!
Oh, oh, what you are

Where you live I live
Where you die, I die!
Oh, yeah! You!

As I wonder through the darkest dark
(dark, dark, dark)
I don't know what tomorrow will bring
For you say that, who not know how to suffer
Will never see good
Lord, I depend, oh I depend on you
Into you
Where do I go when this world forsakes me
Who do I turn to when they put me down
You are my hope, when they all backstab me
You're my beginning, my middle, my end
When there's a whole, in this heart of mine
When they put me down, oh you know
You are my home
My beginning, my middle, my end
My beginning, my middle, my end
All I am left with is to trust in thee, oh Lord
For mankind had disappointed me, oh no
See me weary, for I am lonely, lonely
Father Father, Jah, oh save me now
For I am dying
Where do I go when this world forsakes me
Who do I turn to when they put me down
You are my hope, when they all backstab me
You're my beginning, my middle, my end
When there's a hole, in this heart of mine
When they put me down, oh you know
You are my home
My beginning, my middle, my end
My beginning, my middle, my end
Where do I go
My beginning, my middle, my end
To live, when they forsake me and wound me
I just don't know where to go
Where do I go

Where do I go when this world forsakes me
Who do I turn to when they put me down
You are my hope, when they all backstab me

In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumult

And when this question rise ?
Cause they made the rules in which we're living in today
It's all good 'cause there is one who sees you ever

You have no trust in the fact that of being strong
Get to know this, get to know this
And though you lack physical riches?
You have achieved spiritual growth. This is what counts
So don't worry about all these things that pass away
'Cause the grace of God is sufficient for you
Don't go astray

In all things we commend ourselves
In much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distress
In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumult

U keep pushing the blame on our colonial fathers
U say they came and they took all we had processed
They have to take the abuse that they have caused our present state with their intruding history
Use our goodness and nourishment in the Name of missionary
Lied to us, blinded slaved us, misplaced us, strengthen us, hardened us then
They replaced us now we got to learn from pain
Now it is up to us to gain some recognition
If we stop blaming we could get a better condition

Wake up world!!
Wake up and stop sleeping
Wake up Africa!!
Wake up and stop blaming
Open ur eyes!!
Stand up and rise
Road block oh life penalty
Why do we want to remain where we started
And how long do we want to stop ourselves from thinking
We should learn from experience that what we are here for this existence
But now we decide to use the same hatred to oppress our own brothers
It is so comfortable to say racism is the cause
But this time it is the same color chasing and biting us
Knowledge and selfishness that they gave to us, this is what we use to abuse us
Wake up world!!
Wake up and stop sleeping
Wake up Africa!!
Wake up and stop blaming
Open ur eyes!!
Stand up and rise
Road block oh life penalty
Those who have ears let them hear
Brothers who are not brainwashed take ruins and rest
Pick them up and stick them back together
This is the only way we can change this African weather
Lied to us, blinded slaved us, misplaced us, strengthen us, hardened us then
They replaced us now we got to learn from pain

Wake up world!!
Wake up and stop sleeping
Wake up Africa!!
Wake up and stop blaming
Open ur eyes!!
Stand up and rise
Road block oh life penalty
You got to wake up please
You got too
(Wake up Africa, wake up and stop blaming)
Blaming ha, ha, ha
Open yours eyes your eyes
Stand up and rise
Road block oh life penalty
Wake up...1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I heard my name, did you call me ?
Did you speak truth, when you dug wounds
When you spilled blood, did you say love ?
When you promised the most high
You will not betray
Do you love me now (x4)
Yes, it's heavy on my heart to communicate
Absentminded on the earth devoted to sin
Not knowing i'm dead
Your phrases are highly majestic
I am amazed by your great linguistics
Yet your words are placed together
To sell dubious manifestoes
The end is devastating, barrage of lies
Your words are sweet enticing but false grandeur
Still I go, I go to the foutain where waters flow
Where the truth uprises there I will grow now
Do you love me (x4)
I will grow
I know I have never been found
It is dark for we are all blind
In solitude we know God
In public we do not act God
Is it destiny is it mean to be
Do you love me now
Now that everything has been said and done
Do you love me, now that I function in your madness
Do you love me now, for your love is so cold
Oh sodom and gomorrah caution !!
Do you love me, now that I am no longer meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You got my heart broken
In the state, the way I felt you left me in
Gave me your scripture to read and understand
And not to fear, now these voices in my mind fight against my soul
They want to take over, and I feel weak and sober
There are so many thoughts running through my mind
That you left me all alone but you send me messages say you won't leave me on my own
Oh God of Mercy, yes, I appreciate thee
And when I think that you're not present you're the one carrying me
And I can't see your footprints, you say you are in me
Sometimes I feel so immature, so unclean to even stand before your throne yes
Chorus:
Oh God of Mercy
I appreciate thee
And when I think that I'm alone
You carry me and make me strong (2x)
And when I ask how long 'till we can shout triumph
You say I should be patient you have time for everyone
And when I'm down broken, prayed so hard to get off my depression
To dismiss Earth's equation need to find a solution
I walk through the streets not feeling my body not my soul
Like living it I go through life pain, my heart, stole
Endless deception, don't want to be to myself
To the end comes conclusion it's no use
'Cuz night or man is the devil's residence
And putting God's power to the test
Is the beginning of downfall, of downfall
Oh God of Mercy
I appreciate thee
And when I think that I'm alone
You carry me and make me strong (6x)
You make me strong, yeah, you make me strongEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

This is my confession
I tried so many times to oppress him
Now I decided to explode and let my heart speak its ache
Now I've done all my weak body can fufil I leave it up to him ,and still I know that my anxiousness and my truthfulness
Can't be paid back with his Love X2
I leave it up to him , leave it up
Still I know , that my feelings are for no use
REFRAIN
He's a player not yet ready to behave mature
A man who makes a child still not able to see his future
He's good in deceiving
He's good for love torture
Inspite of my contemplation
I still can't get him captured
A man I thought is just like
Someone I could give myself to completely...No
It's so painful to accept the fact that he's rejected me
I've done so many things to make me believe life is possible without him
Still I always console myself, I...I
And I see the symptoms of my love (for him) on my skin
REFRAIN
RAP
I tried to get him out ,outta my head
It worked out , I deceiving myself, forgot my dignity, he sucked away my happiness in learning new things and made me think I love someone else
No it was self-defense so
Do me no harm,please let me go
Do me no harm,please let me fly
Do me no harm,please let me fly...AH
I gave him wings to let him fly
I let him go so I could grow
Now that I know this love is gone,I...I
I give him wings to let him flyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm careless with the things I own because of you
Speechless for all that we had is what we disregard now
Feel emptiness
You have had enough
But this time I see the truth
You don't need me no more
You don't need me no more
I'm restless cause you don't love me like I love you
I'm restless cause my love just ain't coming through
Tell me how can your love gather so much of hate
Tell me how can you love, when we do not practice what we preach
Did we forget all we have been through
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of light you brought through
There is now darkness surrounding my world
There is now darkness surrounding my world
If you don't come now, Lord, if you don't come now, I'll die
You have had enough
But this time I see the truth
You don't need me no more
You don't need me no more
And in the naked light, I see a brighter day
And at the end of the road, I will sit and smile and say:
You don't need me no more
You don't need me no more
You don't need me no more
You don't need me no more
You don't need me no more

The time has come for you to see
That love is something else than you practice it to be
The line is long for you and me
That leads us to the very depth of our hearts
We're still, on the surface, deceiving ourselves
Inside, we hate and want to see our best friends fall
So, let us make a change
Why can't we turn the page
Lord, make us able
Without you, we are totally unstable
Let us make a change
Why can't we turn the page
Lord, make us able
Without you, we are totally unstable
You talk 'bout peace
Put it in your mouth
The same mouth you use to declare your bombs
Your system is a joke
No heart in it
It's choking us to death
We live in decept
So tell me, oh please, tell me that
(Love) ain't what you're talking about on TV
(Love) ain't what you practice it to be
(Love) ain't the love that you are giving me
(Love) got t'be something you cannot compare anything to
Let us make a change

In this madness, in this world
With its swiftness and its coldness
You’re my peace of mind, yes!
When the world just jeeps turning
And I know not where to head to
You’re peace of mind!
And when I look up in the skies
Is the one that you created...
Oh shining star, please look down for me!
Oh, what you are?
When you look down at me
Beautiful star, do keep your eyes on me!
Oh, oh, what you are
When you look down on me?
It's about my greed when they chase me
When your heart strict
Do you love me?
I appreciate you baby!
And though you seem so far away
You pursuit me I can feel you
But did well within my mind
And I know you’re sometimes lonely
Oh, I wish that I could change it
Oh then I know you still got me
And I pray my love will give you life
To help your breathe to give you smile
You’re my shining star, to take my love and live!
Oh shining star, please look down for me!
Oh, what you are?
When you look down at me
Beautiful star, do keep your eyes on me!
Oh, oh, what you are
When you look down on me?
Where you smile I smile
Where you live I live
Where you die, I die!
Oh, yeah! You!
I’m a shining star, oh I wonder what you are?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
