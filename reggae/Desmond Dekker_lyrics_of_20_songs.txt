No need to worry
Take it easy, take it easy , take it easy
No need to worry
No slippin', no slidin', no bumpin', no

If you fall from the race, it's no disgrace
Just pick yourself from off the ground
Take your time, take it easy, take your time
No need to worry
Take it easy, take it easy , take it easy
No need to worry
For the road is rough
And don't you, don't you, ever get stuck
But take your time, take it easy, take your time
No need to worry, yeah, no, no, no, no, no
Take it easy, take it easy , take it easy
No need to worry

It make no sense at all
To say where you used to work
It make no sense at all
To say how much you used to earn

This is the face of Fu Man Chu

You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try, try and try, try and try
You'll succeed at last
Persecution you must bear
Win or lose you've got to get your share
You've got your mind set on a dream
You can get it, though harder it may seem now
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want, yeah
You can get it if you really want
But you must try, try and try, try and try
You'll succeed at last, don't you know it, listen
Rome was not built in a day
Opposition will come your way
But the hotter the battle you see
Is the sweeter the victory, now
You can get it if you really want
