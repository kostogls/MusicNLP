This town, is coming like a ghost town
All the clubs have been closed down
This place, is coming like a ghost town
Bands won't play no more
Too much fighting on the dance floor

Do you remember the good old days before the ghost town?
We danced and sang, and the music played in a de boomtown

This town, is coming like a ghost town
Why must the youth fight against themselves?
Government leaving the youth on the shelf
This place, is coming like a ghost town
No job to be found in this country
Can't go on no more
The people getting angry

This town, is coming like a ghost town
This town, is coming like a ghost town
This town, is coming like a ghost town
This town, is coming like a ghost town4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(Bernie Rhodes knows. Don't argue!)
Why must you record my phone calls?
Are you planning a bootleg LP?
Said you'd been threatened by gangsters
Now it's you that’s threatening me
Can't fight corruption with con tricks
They use the law to commit crime
I dread to think what the future'll bring
When we’re living in gangster times
(Don't call me Scarface!)
Don't interrupt while I'm talking
Or they'll confiscate all your guitars
Catch 22 says if I sing the truth
They won't make me an overnight star
Don't offer us legal protection
They use the law to commit crime
I dread to think what the future'll bring
When we're living in real gangster times

You've done too much
Much too young
Now you're married with a kid
When you could be having fun with me
Oh no, no gimme no more pickni
You've done too much

When you should be having fun with me
We don't want, we don't want

Ain't he cute?
No he ain't
He's just another burden
On the welfare state
You've done too much
Much too young
Now you're married with a kid
When you could be having fun with me
No gimme, no gimme, no gimme no more pickni
Call me immature
Call me a poser
I'd love to spread manure in your bed of roses
Don't want to be rich
Don't want to be famous
But I'd really hate to have the same name as you
(you silly moo)
You've done too much
Much too young
Now you're married with a kid
When you could be having fun with me
Gi we de birth control, we no want no pickni
You've done too much
Much too young
Now you're chained to the cooker
Making currant buns for tea
Oh no, no gimme no more pickni
Ain't you heard of the starving millions
Ain't you heard of contraception
You really want a program of sterilization?
Take control of the population boom!
It's in your living room
Keep a generation gap

Free Nelson Mandela
Free, free
Free, free, free Nelson Mandela
Free Nelson Mandela
Twenty-one years in captivity
Shoes too small to fit his feet
His body abused but his mind is still free
Are you so blind that you cannot see?
I said free Nelson Mandela
I'm begging you, free Nelson Mandela
Pleaded the causes at the ANC
Only one there in a large army
Are you so blind that you cannot see?
Are you so deaf that you cannot hear his plea?
Free Nelson Mandela
I'm begging you, free Nelson Mandela
Twenty-one years in captivity
Are you so blind that you cannot see?

One two!
If you ever hear a noise in the night
Your body starts to sweat
It shakes and shivers in fright
You go and sleep with your mother
She hates you guts
She knows that you love her
So she holds you tight
All through the night in to the broad daylight
And when she doesn't come home
You'll have to sleep alone
Then you wet your bed and I think that's sad
For a girl of 19 it's more than sad, it's obscene!
One Two!
And your girlfriend sweet little 17
She's got her layered hair and her flared jeans
You know what that means, she's just a little queen
She shares your London flat
She thinks that London's where it's at
Although it stinks and when it rains you wear your hat
And your plum coloured PVC wet- look maxi mac
You tie your ginger hair back in a bun
You're the ugliest creature, under the sun!
One Two!
Go!
One Two!
And you think it's about time that you died, and I agree
So you decide on suicide
You tried but you never quite carried it out
You only wanted to die in order to show off
And if you think you're gonna bleed all over me
You're even wronger than you'd normally be
And the only things you want to see are kitsch
And the only thing you want to be is rich
Your little pink up-pointed nose begins to twitch
I know you know you're just a little bitch!
One Two!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Out of bed at eight am
Out my head by half past ten
Out with mates and dates and friends
That's what I do at weekends
I can't talk and I can't walk
But I know where I'm going to go
I'm going watch my money go
At the Locarno, no
When my feet go through the door
I know what my right arm is for
Buy a drink and pull a chair
Up to the edge of the dance floor
Bouncers bouncing through the night
Trying to stop or start a fight
I sit and watch the flashing lights
Moving legs in footless tights
I go out on Friday night and I come home on Saturday morning
I go out on Friday night and I come home on Saturday morning
I like to venture into town
I like to get a few drinks down
The floor gets packed the bar gets full
I don't like life when things get dull
The hen party have saved the night
And freed themselves from drunken stags
Having fun and dancing in
A circle round their leather bags
I go out on Friday night and I come home on Saturday morning
I go out on Friday night and I come home on Saturday morning
But two o'clock has come again
It's time to leave this paradise
Hope the chip shop isn't closed
Cos' their pies are really nice
I'll eat it in the taxi queue
Stand in someone else's spew
Wish I had lipstick on my shirt
Instead of piss stains on my shoes
I go out on Friday night and I come home on Saturday morning
I go out on Friday night and I come home on Saturday morning
I go out on Friday night and I come home on Saturday morning
I go out on Friday night and I come home on Saturday morningEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Each day I walk along this lonely street
Trying to find, find a future
New pair of shoes are on my feet
Cos' fashion is my only culture
Nothing ever change, oh no...
Nothing ever change
People say to me just be yourself
It makes no sense to follow fashion
How could I be anybody else
I don't try, I've got no reason
Nothing ever change, oh no...
Nothing ever change
I'm just living in a life without meaning
I walk and walk, do nothing
I'm just living in a life without feeling
I talk and talk, say nothing
Nothing ever change, oh no...
Nothing ever change
I walk along this same old lonely street
Still trying to find, find a reason
Policeman comes and smacks me in the teeth
I don't complain, it's not my function
Nothing ever change, oh no...
Nothing ever change
They're just living in a life without meaning
I walk and walk, do nothing
They're just playing in a life without thinking
They talk and talk, say nothing
I'm just living in a life without feeling
I walk and walk, I'm dreaming
I'm just living in a life without feeling
I talk and talk, say nothing
I'm just living in a life without meaning

Lynval Golding, born 1951
Mendes, St Catherine, Jamaica

The year was 1954, you know
Sir Winston Churchill shout across the Western islands
He said, "Come, help us rebuild this country devastated by war"
And so anyway, my father set sail upon the wind rush, bound for a new life
My father was a tailor by trade
And so this could be the possibility of all possibilities
But no, there was no cloth to stitch
Instead, you know what?
He found work in a steel foundry
Pouring hot metal day and night, day and night
And even worse, you know what then?
Him tried to find a room to rent
This was becoming a nightmare for him
Him knock on door after door after door
But the sign on the window keep saying the same thing
"No dogs, no Irish, no blacks"
Welcome to England

I'm not here to teach you
I'm not here to preach to you
I just want to reach out
And say
Time move on
In 1964, my father shout across Jamaica
"Son," him said, "Come join me"
So I set sail on a ship called the Askena
When I reached Northampton on a cold winter's night
Boy, I was freezing
I want to tell the captain to just take me back to Jamaica
But no, I was here to stay
So my father sent me to a school
Linden Road school in Gloucester
I remember the first playtime
A boy shout across at me
"Oi, you black bastard, come 'ere"
I said, "What?"
He said, "Come 'ere, you black bastard"
I still couldn't believe, I says, "What?
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?"
Boy, welcome to England

I'm not here to teach you
I'm not here to preach to you
I just want to reach out
And say
In 1994, I move again
The land of the free, the home of the brave
The United States of America
And there I was
Just walking along in the sun, minding my own business
Such a beautiful day, man, when I remember
I had to buy a watch on my sister's birthday
When why eventually I found this store
As I walk through the door
This woman in the store shouted at me
"What you doing here, you goddamn nigga?"
I said, "I-I'm just, I'm just trying to buy a watch for my sister"
When she heard my accent, she said
"Oh, you're not from here, you're not one of them"
"One of them?" I said, "You mean me being black?
Well ma'am, let me tell you something right, I am black
Is that all you see? The color of my skin?"
In England, them call you a black bastard
In America, they call you a goddamn nigga
Boy, welcome to my world

But I'm not here to teach you
I'm not here to preach to you
I just want to reach out and say
Black lives matterEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(You're going home in a fucking ambulance)/(You're gonna get your fucking heads kicked in)

I'm going out tonight
I don't know if I'll be alright
Everyone wants to hurt me
Baby danger in the city
I have to carry a knife
Because there's people threatening my life
I can't dress just the way I want
I'm being chased by the National Front

Concrete jungle, animals are after me
Concrete jungle, it ain't safe on the streets
Concrete jungle, glad I got my mates with me

I won't fight for a cause
Don't want to change the law
Leave me alone, just leave me alone
I want to get out on my own
I'm walking home tonight
I only walk where there's lots of lights
In the alleys and the doorways
Some throw a bottle right in your face
Concrete jungle, animals are after me
Concrete jungle, it ain't safe on the streets
Concrete jungle, glad I got my mates with me

The commandments of I, Saffiyah Khan
Thou shall not listen to Prince Buster
Or any other man offering kindly advice
In matters of my own conduct
You may call me a feminazi or a femoid
And then see if I give a stinking shit
Pseudo-intellectuals on the internet
They tell me I'm unhappy because I'm not feminine
Failing to consider that I may be unhappy
Because it's 3 AM and I'm in the depths of YouTube
Watching them whining
Thou may catcall me on the street
But thou should take note that I'll catcall you right back
To tell you that you look pretty sexy too in your joggers
Or your suit, or your new-found look of confusion
Girls should not turn on each other
Or use man-made ideals like paths
Don't you realize that you're only making a fool of yourself
When you ask, "Why don't you wear makeup?"
Is that what it takes to impress a bloke
Whose brain is made up of promises of curvy size zeros
And anti-gravity tits?
Thou shall not tell a girl she deserved it
Because her skirt was too short
She walked home, streets lights illuminating her as a target
But she started it, because she looked at him
And he finished it 'cause he wanted to
And they'll bring out her skirt as Exhibit A before the judge
And she should have the right to say
"Thou shall not tell me what to wear
Nor how to wear it"
I shall not be the icing on your cake
And I shall not be the candy on your arm
But I shall be seen
And I will be heard
The commandments of I, Saffiyah Khan

Why did you try to hurt me?
I got to know, know, know
Did you really want to kill me?
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Why do we have to fight?

From attack last night
I know I am black
You know you are white
I'm proud of my black skin
And you are proud of your white, so
Why did you try to hurt me?
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Did you really want to kill me?
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
We don't need no British Movement
Nor the Ku Klux Klan
Nor the National Front

I just want to live in peace
Why can't you be the same?
Why should I live in fear?
This fussing and fighting's insane
With a Nazi salute and a steel capped boot
A Nazi salute and a steel capped boot
You follow like sheep inna wolf clothes
You follow like sheep inna wolf clothes
We chase you out the dance hall, we chase you through the door
We chase you out the dance hall, we chase you through the door

Cos' we can't take no more of this at all
With a Nazi salute and a steel capped boot
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
You follow like sheep inna wolf clothes
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
You're too scared to make a speech during the light
Without a thousand police protecting your rights
To threaten and abuse, incite or fight
But who will protect me from you in the night?
Why did you try to hurt me?
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Did you really want to kill me
