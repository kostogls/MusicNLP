Ayy, in my apartment a long time ago
I knew a bad bitch, but she was kinda slow
Still gave it up when it's a few of us
She let me finger-fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She wanted to hang with us, we wanted one thang
Just penetratin' that throat, dawg
She choked on it like smoke, dawg
But whenever I fucked up my re-up
In a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefer
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can page to put a "69"
And I know it time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
"Why you always give your ass up?
I mean, damn, these hoes get paid
All you do is get laid—this shit don't add up."
She said, "Tip, all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it ain't real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
And then never call back, I still fuck."
And that's fucked up, but she so trill
I need somethin', she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga, guess where we go chill?
For 'bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds 'til it go down
I remember shawty, she stayed down
I won't say her name ‘cause she married now
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then

She would always turn heads when she'd fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me, she had a thing for me
When we kicked it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watchin' just to see if the police comin'
We got close over time, her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17
I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive
I was goin' back and forth with each flight
Another show after show, each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh, one night I had a few
Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye
I told her: "Hurry up, meet me at the room!"
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive
What my common sense neglected
And two months later, next thing I know
I got a text that said "I'm pregnant"
And you can almost bet she kept it
And that's the reason why you left me
On top of all that, it wasn't even mine
I went and got paternity tested—damn!
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then
Wait, hol' up, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
Jay 305 had gave me high five
When I said I’m in hot pursuit
You said I won’t ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv
But no freestyle I never do
You lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
You overlookin' every nigga that ain’t quite ready
To make it rain on you like I'm about to break a levee
Hol' up, that pussy petty
Yeah, your nails did, your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
Her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine, ho!
Tried to make some time, ho!
But I ain’t got the time or the patience
To stop and wait in line, ho!
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggas—fuck you and Mick Romney!
I’m grown now, I’m on my own now
I’m po-o-o-oppin'
Change my phone now when I get home now
I got o-o-o-options
Fast forward, wait, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
And your three kids and three baby daddies
Same car note that’s overdue? I know
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then143EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm in Brazil with a bitch
Catch me in a mansion in the hills with a bitch
Get her out them tennis shoes, throw some heels on a bitch
I’m the type of nigga split a mil with a bitch
Hold up, only if she bad though
Out here trying to find someone that better than my last ho
Take her to my castle, drown her in my cash flow
Say your dick so little she can fit it in her asshole
Told me she can't ride this shit no further than a cab go
Said I got that dumb dick, she wanna be my tutor
So she give me brain, getting head on the scooter
Had sex on the beach from Bermuda up to Cuba
I done fucked a lot of dimes but I’m looking for a cuter bitch

Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin' new, I seen it all before
But still, I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote

It's stupid how I go in knowin' everybody knowin'
That I’m sewin' up the game, destroyin' like they hate me for it
Eventually, see they can't beat and then with me, they join
Others sworn under oath or banished, left completely scorned
You tell lies, get cut, nigga, kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishin' they were this hot
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on, I’m the Jetsons, you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone, high-steppin', Prime Time
Thought you niggas been known, ain't no blockin' my shine
Like my new Air Yeezys, you can see me in the nighttime
I get rich off livin' life, you check to check, recitin' rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate? Have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey, my dough ain't in its right mind
Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin' new, I seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote

You're starin' straight into a barrel of hate
Terrible fate, not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait, Sarah, you're late
Your train left, mascara and eggs smear in your face
Night's over, goodbye, ho, I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut ain't nothin' to cry over
Never shoulda came within range of my Rover
Shoulda known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with her mind, hold up
She mistook me for some high roller
But I won't buy her soda
Unless it's Rock and Rye cola (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya
Tryna pull five bucks from me is like tryna pull five molars
You'll get your eyes swolled up
I'm on my straight-grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay-ass teddy bear?
Bitch, you're already bi-polar
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
Still, I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

The credit roll, the curtain close, the movie over with (that's it)
But don’t get mad at me, go blame the chick who wrote this shit (nope)
Yeah, life is sure a bitch (bitch), but she know I’m rich (I'm rich)
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again, I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pourin' in
Pesos, Euros, Yen, ah-ha, I’m paid, never gon' be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearin' any chain
Never gon' see me totin' anything, all you gon' see is bang
It's so nice where I kick it, hate you never get to visit
Yeah, I’m on another level, but you niggas still can't get it
It's all over ‘fore you finish–sorry, bro, this where we end it
Won’t give you the satisfaction of me givin' you the business

Yeah, I guess life is a bitch, ain't it, Tip?
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldn’t give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I’m givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I’m sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't, I'ma stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock I'm racin' it
Double timing it, but I still spit triple the amount of
Insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks
To catch on; while you strong arm, I'm like Stretch Armstrong
Man, I still say K-Mart's like there's an apostrophe 's' on it, dawg
And they say McDonald's isn’t a restaurant, well I guess I’m wrong
But if you're gonna tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs, you can get the F on, dawg
And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I’m as strong as the King, they were gone ‘fore they came
Now I don’t wanna hang, I slap five with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle, shawty, that's why

Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
But still I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it's over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote82EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Ay... this a special what's happenin' to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
E'rybody right here
What you need to do is be thankful for the life you got, y'knowmsayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
Start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters

My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life
Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)

My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life
Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha-ha
Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha-ha
Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha-ha
Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha-ha

My cup runneth over with pinot grigio, hol' up
You bogus in the Lambo if you ain't lifting the door up
You bogus poppin' pills if you ain't pickin the ho up
You bogus running out on your kids, my nigga, grow up
For God's sake, like a wedding, cutting large cake
For large stakes, let the hammer bang, broad day
Ayy, never mind what the blogs say
This what my mind and my heart say
My philosophy: profit off of my properties
Get it, flip it, we got to be rich, that broke shit is obsolete
Possibly off of my rocker, watch how you watching me
Sophisticated, psychotic, fly as a pilot
Officially solid, all you wish you could get—I got it
Unlimited titanium, nigga, what's in your wallet?
Out of gladiator college, I made it summa cum laude
Where you clowns couldn't have got a cap and gown if you bought it
I parlay with Saudis, buying crude oil and diamonds
Hustle January, July, fly to Dubai
A broke nigga telling me 'bout how I'm dividing the pies
Like a blind nigga telling me it's an eye for an eye
Bullheaded and stubborn, I'll be that way 'til I die
But find a nigga with more hustle than me—I dare you to try
And according to the hand on my Audemars (Audemars)
It's my time to shine, so fuck y'all (Fuck y'all)
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?
The fact is you can't please everybody
You can't please everybody
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?

I grew up in the gutter, life a motherfucker
I guess that's why I don't trust a motherfucker
Seen a nigga snitch on they mom, shoot at his brother
Go to prison, in love with a bitch, and a nigga fuck her
I seen real Gs destroyed by real suckers
Innocent ladies raped and defenseless babies abducted
Such a horrible truth, but you see it over and over
It's nothing; you numb to it, and your heart grow colder
Pacify your pain with a chain and a Rover
Fuck it; justify your action with stacking your dough up
He show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda
Just enough for me to blow up; nigga, hold up
Switch the flow up, 'cause these niggas be snitching so much
I promise all they missing's a badge, coffee, and donut
Go to jail—so what? Never see my integrity perish
That ain't the Harris' way, study my pedigree
Promise I'm one of the only ones who keep it a hundred
Prol'ly why I think they all out to get me, you can't convince me
Large money and fame will plant seeds of envy
To make my partners resent me enough to come and get me
Catch me slipping and hit me just like they did 50
'Cause I'm in the position that he think he should be given
Listen, dawg, the fact of the matter is
I'm on a narrow path and we all can't travel
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?
The fact is you can't please everybody
You can't please everybody
What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?

What it ain't? What it is?
Even if you gotta live
I learned that apartment's way more exciting
Than a big-ass house on a hill
I used to be a way better writer and a rapper
When I used to want a black Karmann Ghia (Woo!)
Now a nigga speeding in a Porsche (Ahh)
Feeling like I'm going off a course (Ahh)
Cut these fuck niggas off
Negative in my life, scream that 'til I'm hoarse (Woo)
Duck these, get the fuck off me, projectiles
Bitch, he ain't really got a choice (Mmm)
I'm living my life live yours (Ahh)
I don't even like rapping fast (Ahh)
But that's how the world come to me
Talk to me sideways, nigga, that's your ass
Slow it down
This that shit that'll make you call your mama
Say, "Hey, I'm sorry for begging
For all them clothes you couldn't afford"
And this the type of shit that'll make you call your rap partner
And say, "I'm sorry I'm awkward, my fault for fuckin' up the tours"
I hated all the attention so I ran from it (I ran from it)
Fuck it if we did
But I hope we ain't lose no fans from it (No fans from it)
I'm a grown-ass kid, you know
I ain't never cared about no damn money
Why do we try so hard to be stars just to dodge comments?
And this that shit that'll make you call your baby mama
When you gone on half a pill
Don't know why, but that's how it is
Then you take a flight back to the crib
Y'all make love like college kids
And you say all the shit you gon' do better
We can try this shit again
'Round the time the dope wear off
You feel stupid, she feel lost
That's that dopamine, I mean dope—
I mean, you think Cupid done worn off
Waiting in the hallway with her arms crossed
Baby boy face full of applesauce
Maybe should have stayed but it ain't yo fault
Too much pressure, I peel off, I'm sorry
Was young and had to choose between you
And what the rest of the world might offer me
Shit, what would you do? (I was 21)
Well, I'd prob'ly do it differently if second the chance
Only if some cool-ass older man
Would've let me know in advance
There's this quarry that is dug so deep in a father's chest
When he feel that he's broken up his nest
And he figures, shit—he was just doing the best that he could
Which end up being the worst that he could
And all some pussy nigga on the Internet can say
Is, "That verse ain't good"
It's boring? Boring?
Really? Hahahaha

When I'm disgusted with this world and
I can hardly breathe and
Told so many lies, I don't know what to believe
I discussed it with this girl and this is what she said
She said, "Lay down, baby, baby, rest your weary head," ugh
A lovely distraction, but my mind don't wanna rest
But my body disagree, so I laid up on her breast, yes
"Ooooh, you so fucking fine," I
Woke up the next morning with new purpose on my mind
"Ooooh, who pulls your ponytail?
Who knows your body well, huh?"

What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Ayy, let me kick it to you right quick, man
Not on some gangsta shit, man, on some real shit
Anybody done been through the same thing
I'm sure you feel the same way
Big Phil, this for you, pimpin'

Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, bullet hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situation
Coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know, we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now, think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
'Cause I hit you, and you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone
But the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone
But the new me will be alright 'cause
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)

I gotta grind, won't stop, hustle won't quit
Shine like no other, I be on some other shit
I got a high price lifestyle, super bad bitch
If I want it, bet I got it
If I don't then all I gotta do is
Go, get it, stay about my business
Ball till I fall, floss until I'm finished
I just go, get it, stay about my business
I'm living just to kill it, stacking millions to the ceiling

Every day above ground, all I wanna do is ball
Put my money over bitches, put my hustle over all
Louis down to the drawers, Louis Vuitton kicks
Got a Mad Hatter swagger, bitch I’m stupid dumb sick
With a group of young bitches and they're stupid dumb thick
I’m the marathon man, all I do is run shit
A sophisticated convict, superficial, still official
Multi-million dollar shit, money is the object
Hot shit, bitch, I got a sauna on my arm
Six figure with no diamond, Richard Mille and Vacheron
They just talk about they got it
I’m the upper echelon, though
Bitch, I‘m 'bout that action, you could go on with that convo
I have done more than you dream 'bout
Got your dream bitch and your dream house
On lean passing them beans out
With a bad crew, the whole team high
Go on boy, get seen by, bro you know me, you know I be
Stacking that dough, that’s all I see
I G-O G-E-T I-T
I gotta grind, won't stop, hustle won't quit
Shine like no other, I be on some other shit
I got a high price lifestyle, super bad bitch
If I want it, bet I got it
If I don't then all I gotta do is
Go, get It - stay about my business
Ball til I fall, floss until I'm finished
I just go, Get It - Stay about my business
I'm living just to kill it, stacking millions to the ceiling

I live life, fuck late night
Get shitfaced when I take flight
I get paid, no sick days
My outfit’s on switch blade
Don’t sniff yay, but I blow dro'
Bank roll on loco
Still ride with that fo'-fo'
Don’t let my P-O know
Bad white bitch super thick
I’m Ice T, she Coco
She got another bitch, them other bitches
Her ass fat, face so-so, no paper trail
No phone call, no emails, no photos
Just backshot, with that fat butt
And low blow headbutts in slow-mo
A Purple label, Polo and Akoo, that’s all I do
Man I Striver Row my denim in my new Margiela shoes
Man, we be cool if we just parle, on Margharita Molly
And the strongest pack around bumpin' Sade out in Maui
We menagin’ for a hobby
We kick it how we kick it
Know you envy how I’m living
Chicks just can’t resist this pimping
Get the million 'bout my business
Bro you know me, you know I be
Stacking that dough that’s all I see
I G-O G-E-T I-T
I gotta grind, won't stop, hustle won't quit
Shine like no other, I be on some other shit

With the legs hangin' out

Hey, have you ever loved somebody so much you can’t stand it but can’t do without 'em?
Do anything for 'em cause you truly do adore 'em
Like dedicate songs, write poems
But they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore 'em
But you feel like they feel like you ain’t right for 'em
Therefore your heart’s torn
Between bein' with 'em forever, leavin' 'em never
But it seem like you arguin', fightin' over whatever
Maybe we can leave, find someone better
Even though you know you’ve never known none better
My heart say "nah, she can’t leave, won't let her"
Been head over heels since the very day I met her
Fell so deep in love I ain’t been able to get up
Sometimes I want some peace of mind and she won’t shut up
Love her to death, don’t know whether to kiss her or kill her

Should’ve known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
And we don’t know which one to choose
When either way, we’re gonna lose
Still we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
I guess I’d rather suffer with her than be miserable without her
I buy a lot of Prada, Gucci and Balenciaga
To keep her content, and keep down the nonsense
But every corner we turn around's a conflict
Mostly dumb shit, like who she run with
Where the fuck you been? Your pants – they don’t fit
Really, honestly speaking, some things I don’t get
No matter how much she try she can’t make it make more sense
Therefore, here we go again
Screamin', yellin' at the top of our lungs, she goin' in
Saying the kind of shit I be like "if you was a man
I would go in your shit, for real, no shit"
But I love her so much that I can’t forget
That the feel of a kiss, it could heal when I’m sick
Still, I don’t like to feel like this
If I didn’t miss her, I would try to get her killed right quick

Should’ve known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
And we don’t know which one to choose
When either way, we’re gonna lose
Still we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
Every time we say our goodbyes
A little piece of my heart breaks off inside
I don’t really ever know why
If I could live without you I’d try

Should’ve known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
And we don’t know which one to choose
When either way, we’re gonna lose
Still we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Never have you seen in your lifetime
A more divine southern rapper with a swag like mine
Facin' all kinda time, but smile like I'm fine
Brag with such passion and shine without tryin'
Believe me, pain's a small thang to a giant
I was born without a dime, out the gutter, I climbed
Spoke my mind and didn't stutter one time
Ali say, "Even the greatest gotta suffer sometime"
So I huff and puff, rhymes, lyrics so sick wit it
Set the standard in Atlanta, how to get-get-get it
So you up-and-coming rappers wanna diss, just kill it
I'm officially the realest, point blank, period
Whether I still live in the hood or just visit
Whatever you can do in the hood, I done did it
That's why the dope boys and the misfits feel it
This still his city long as TIP livin', nigga

I ain't dead (nah!), I ain't done (nah!)
I ain't scared (of what?), I ain't run (from who?)
But still I stand (yeah) No matter what, people
Here I am, yeah, no matter what, remember
I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?) Yeah I know (haha!)
Here I go, yeah, no matter what shawty, here I go
No matter what, shawty
You let the blog sites and the magazines tell it
I'm sure to be in jail until 2027
Rather see me in the cell instead of this new McLaren
God will take you through Hell just to get you to Heaven
So even though it's heavy, the load I will carry
Grin and still bear it, win and still share it
Apologies to the fans, I hope you can understand it
Life can change your directions, even when you ain't planned it
All you can do is handle, worst thing you can do is panic
Use it to your advantage, avoid insanity, manage to conquer
Every obstacle, make impossible possible
Even when winning illogical, losing's still far from optional, and
Yeah, they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
But when life throw punches, block and counter like a boxer do
Been locked inside mi casa too long, I did a song
To make it known that the King lives on, pimpin'

I ain't dead (nah!), I ain't done (nah!)
I ain't scared (of what?), I ain't run (from who?)
But still I stand (yeah) No matter what, people
Here I am, yeah, no matter what, remember
I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?) Yeah I know (haha!)
Here I go, yeah, no matter what shawty, here I go
No matter what, shawty
Even in solitude, there's still no hotter dude
I show you how to do what you do, you ain't gotta clue
All you do is follow dude, sound like a lotta dudes
I'll weather whatever storm, make it out without a bruise
I understand why, now, with my hands tied
They take shots, cause if I'm out there it's a landslide
But revenge is best served as a cold dish
And suckas will get served, nigga, no shit
Guess it was understood, for me, it was over-with
But I don't quit, if you ain't noticed yet
They couldn't wait to say, "Goodnight, shawty"
So they could try to rhyme, act and look like shawty
Go get a beat from Toomp and make a hook like shawty
Before ya know it I'm back, what it look like, shawty?
I lost my partner and my daughter in the same year
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here
Yeah, and I hope the picture painted clear
If your heart filled with faith, then you can't fear
Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin'?
Easy, let go and let God deal with it

I ain't dead (nah!), I ain't done (nah!)
I ain't scared (of what?), I ain't run (from who?)
But still I stand (yeah) No matter what, people
Here I am, yeah, no matter what, remember
I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?) Yeah I know (haha!)
Here I go, yeah, no matter what shawty, here I go
No matter what, shawty12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Give a damn if I'm flat broke (nah!)
I'm filthy rich, I'm still the same, that's a fact though
Oh yeah, we all about the money, nigga
All you got is money when my name hold weight like a fat ho
I can never join in the game 'less I'm capo
Milkin' these niggas even though I'm fuckin' lactose
Take off on the cops, Mama said, "Don't look back, bro"
I'm in New York and I'm ballin' just like a Net, though
I'm drinkin' bubblegum pink like Pepto
Bismol, bet she wanna come through
And get low, I'ma be with Haitians
All my Zos, Tip tell these niggas, bro
Bankroll Mob, yeah, we on, we retarded

When you dead, bet ya I'ma take your place on the Forbes list
So better miss with that bullshit, partner
I'll be hopping out your bushes with a full clip, got 'em (got 'em!)
I'll take a big stick to a fuck nigga neck (nigga neck!)
Swinging at it, kind of like a piñata
I'm a beast with the choppa, I'm the same without it
Graduated from the lean, that's my alma mater
Um! Shoot 'em in his head, he say, "Look at my roof!"
No sticks, no seeds, only kush in my kush
Make a nigga commit suicide and call it a selfie
I get M's like mmm-mmmm-mmm
I'm an asshole, I'm full of myself
You get an asshole full of my foot
They find your ass in the woods when they look
And these hoes ain't as good as they look
I need to take my own advice though
Cause if the pussy good then I'm good
Where your ghetto pass, nigga? I been big since a little-ass nigga
You little-ass nigga, you don't get a pass, nigga
Started as a middle-class nigga
When I blew up, I ain't even hear the blast, nigga (woo!)
I was chillin', smokin' on the loud
Focused on the future, but I need my money now
Don't give me the runaround
Upstairs in my mansion, knock-knock, "Who's there?"
I ain't even comin' down if it ain't about the money

If it ain't about the money (Yeah!)

Both the feds and the state wanna see bout me
The whole city got biz-zerk, he got three
That other nigga got a hit, but shawty, he not me (Naw)
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed
The King back now, hoes don't even know how to act now
Hit the club, strippers getting naked 'fore I sat down
Still balling, money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down
I'm on the road, doing shows, putting my mack down

And if I catch another case I know I'll truly be missed, so I'ma—
Keep a cool head, stay out of the news
And show these other rappers it's bedtime (Bedtime)
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time
I copped a chromed-out, hard-top Carrera to shine
I got some time, it ain't shit, 'cause I get better with time
Who got a flow and a live show better than mine?

I got a packed house yellin' (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

Will you show up on the scene with two guns drew?
Or you and your friend and play a little two-on-two?
If you knew half of what I knew, then you'd be hitting the deck
I got a tool and a vest—I can get some respect
I'ma make it hard for a sucker nigga to flex
Show thim this ain't the squad for a nigga to test
Pimp, my nuts too large, and we way too fresh
Work well with nines, AK's, and Tecs
And quick to check a lame like a game of chess
You wanna beef, nigga? Bring your best

I don't give no fuck bout no nigga, I promise, I promise
I throw me some ones on these bitches
I stack them hundreds to the ceiling, they over there runnin'
I look like I came from nothin'
And I look like I came for somethin' and I'm comin', I want it
Yeah, I drink on that lean
And I smoke on that dope til I motherfuckin' vomit
We got London on the track, on the track, on the track, on the track...32EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Take it off, chick, bend over, let me see it
Le-le-let me see it, bend over, let me see it, see it
Take it off, chick, bend over, let me see it
Le-le-let me see it, let me see it, take it off

Girl, take it off for me, you know just what I want
It's always hard to leave, this private show
Let me see you, see you, let me see you take it off, off
Let me see you take it off, off
Take it off, let me
Let me see you take it off, take it off
(Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Hey, shawty let me see you take it off, toot it up
Back into me, pass it to me
Imagine hanging halfway off the mattress
While your ass is moving
Up and down, back and forth, so ratchet when you 'posed to be
A lady to the naked eye but a nasty lil ho to me
If only the masses could see your ass when it's in action, I swear (I swear)
Manhandle you in public places, I make you take it right here
You got no idea (idea), listen, girl, with this pole right here, ow
Beat it up, be grabbing hair, leaving hand prints on your derrière (yeah)
Now can you just kiss it for me
While I'm doing 'bout a hundred on the highway?
Get it sloppy wet, get it bent
Girl, I bet you could finish before I pull up on the driveway
And this ain't no child play
This grown man B.I., girl, I'll say
I got your ass in the scope, ain't gotta be close, shawty
I could hit your pussy from a mile away, ayy
Girl, take it off for me, you know just what I want
It's always hard to leave, this private show
Let me see you, see you, let me see you take it off, off
Let me see you take it off, off
Take it off, let me
Let me see you take it off, take it off
(Ayy, let me see it, for real)
Hey, let me see you take it off, lay it down
Like this my last day in town
I'm putting in work, no playing 'round
But shawty, I'm saying, now
Me let you walk away without walking funny
Be talking 'bout me, I highly doubt it
So, let me take you to a private island
Make you take this dick, don't cry about it
How it feel to you, girl? Don't lie about it
No, shawty, you ain't gotta lie about it
Blacking out in that pussy like a power outage
Got a man, well he gonna be sour 'bout it
But I just wanna be on your team
Provide you with your protein
Leave wet dreams all in your face
Them tattoos all over your waist
Got me rock solid, come touch that
I'm fucking you like I'm upset
Choking you, long stroking you
Say you came twice, not enough yet
Because a cat that fat is very rare
And my dick ought to be buried there
I love how you kick it in public
But in private, we on some wild shit (hahaha)
Girl, take it off for me, you know just what I want
It's always hard to leave, this private show
Let me see you, see you, let me see you take it off, off
Let me see you take it off, off
Take it off, let me
Let me see you take it off, take it off
Made a reservation, you're my favorite place to be
All day, contemplating, baby, waiting patiently
There's no body like your body when you climb on top of me
We're in hell and lady, you're the closest thing to heavenly
I want you all to myself
Nothing at all, I can't help it
'Cause what you got on is fly as hell, but I need a better view
Just show me the real you

Girl, take it off for me (take it off), you know just what I want (I want)
It's always hard to leave (it's hard, it's hard, it's hard), this private show (yeah, let me)
Let me see you, see you, let me see you take it off, off
Let me see you take it off, off
Take it off, let me
Let me see you take it off, take it off42EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hey, T.I.P. pimpin'
Hey, shorty, why you gotta act like that?
I'm sayin', I'm just tryin' to be nice to you

Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

Can't help but notice how you glowing, I can see in yo' face
Now, I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing, that you need your space
Selling niggas one thing, you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between your knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you making, get your knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I got a mansion and a gate, you with me and you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck with 23's the case
600 G's in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word, we can leave today, this song's special
And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing making you sad making you stay?
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

Can he touch it like that, and make it feel like this?
How I left and came back and it's still like this?
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest?
Take advantage of what you're concealing in your dress?
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best?
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you with respect?
Give you sex 'til you sweat, tongue kissing on your neck?
It's been awhile since she got it like this, I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
You confused, ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how you keep saying no with your panties so wet?

Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
Ay, this nigga playing mind games, man
I think the time came that your mind changed, you understand?
Life is like a chess move
You need to make your next move your best move
Keep it pimpin', you understand? Hey
I mean, you know what I'm saying
I done showed you how I feel, you know what I'm saying
I put myself all the way out there, you know
The ball in your court, man
But I just got a question for you: Is you happy?

Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
