If I don't have the mag I get a bastard stabbed
With a knife big as a claw of an Alaskan crab
Young, I'm down with Vinnie, give me six weeks
All y'all little pipsqueaks is up shit's creek
Think we a joke? I'll put three in your throat
Drunk off gin and C&C coke then we flee in a boat
Then I come open up the spot with Coconut Ciroc
So the hoes'll suck some cock
Then I'll forget to call her, after the nut I get attention deficit disorder
1-5 catch us off X's and dust
Whole clique of registered sex offenders
Pop shit, we'll hold your funeral XVIs
Niggas' money come in Roman numerals
Your block slow now, she fuck with them rappers
Cause y'all niggas' money took a muscle relaxer

I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
It's work, not how I pass the time
I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
It's work, not how I pass the time
I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
It's work, not how I pass the time
I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
It's work, not how I pass the time
Our music's strong enough to stop a bomb
I'm putting pressure on you kids like I'm a soccer mom
Who you think idea that it was to stop Saddam?
Who you think idea that was to drop the bomb?
You get your shit rocked ma like Mustafa song
You blowing smoke you motherfucker, you should cop a bong
The nine Taurus jam a little bit, the Glock is strong
I move brutal and use voodoo like Papa Shango
Over a billion Muslims, you could never stop Islam
Over a billion bullets shooting from the chopper's arm
The backstage filled with liquor and a lot of traum'
Cause it's been hard on Vinnie since my father gone
I'm about to blow the fucking horns like it was Rosh Hashanah
This is the calm before the storm, Armageddon's on
Carry a motherfucker head that I shred in 'Nam
I speak literally, figuratively, the prophet gone

I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
It's work, not how I pass the time
I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
It's work, not how I pass the time
I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
It's work, not how I pass the time
I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
It's work, not how I pass the time
You don't have to search and question
I have the purse and the murder weapon
Never get a second chance to make a first impression
I'm no virgin to murder and I'm an urban legend
Rather be of real service than to serve in Heaven
I don't like cops, I don't like co-operators
I don't like traitors or story corroborators
In any problem I'm the common denominator
My behaviour is the product of intoxicators
I'm just blood addicted, it's the other liquid
I'm above the limit off of the blood of the wicked
Don't even ask, there's somebody in the body bags
The blood matches what's on the hatchets and hockey mask
I'm never traumatized, I don't have to compromise
I don't have to economize the homicides
You tell Jesus to take the wheel, my faith is nil
I believe that even Jesus has a way to kill25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"I have spoken to you from this office, where so many decisions have been made that shaped the history of this nation."
"I have always tried to do what was best for the nation."
(Duck… and cover!)
()

I don't know why I'm over here, this job is evil
They sent me here to Vietnam to kill innocent people
My mother wrote me, said: "The President, he doesn't care."
He tryin' to leave the footprints of America here
They say we tryin' to stop Chinese expansion
But I ain't seen no Chinese since we landed
Sent my whole entire unit, thinkin' we could win
Against the Vietcong guerrillas there in Gia Định
I didn't sign up to kill women or any children
For every enemy soldier, we killin' six civilians
Yeah, and it ain't right to me
I ain't got enough of motherfuckin' fight in me
It frightens me, and I just wanna see my son and moms
But over here they droppin' seven million tons of bombs
I spent my days dodgin' all these booby-traps and mines
And at night prayin' to God that I get back alive
And I'm forced to sit back and wonder
Why I was a part of Operation Rolling Thunder
In a foxhole with nine months left here
Jungle like the fuckin' harbinger of death here
I don't wanna be here, I'm scared, I just wanna go home
You fucking kidding me?! Don't be a pussy!
Don't you love your country?!
I like being here (True story), I'm ready
Call me Thorburn, John A., staff sergeant
Marksman, skilled in killin', illin', I'm able and willin'
Kill a village elephant, rapin' and pillage a village
Illegitimate killers, U.S. Military guerrillas
This ain't no real war, Vietnam shit
World War II, that's a war, this is just a military conflict
Soothin' drug abusin', Vietnamese women screwin'
Sex, gamblin' and boozin' — all this shit is amusin'
Bitches and guns, this is every man's dream
I don't wanna go home where I'm just an ordinary human being
Special Op, Huey chopper gun ship, run shit
Gook run when the minigun spit, won't miss
Kill shit, spit four-thousand bullets a minute
Victor Charlie, hair-trigger, hit it, I'm in it to win it
Get it, the lieutenant hinted, the villain, I been it
The killin', I did it, cripple, did it
Pictures I painted is vivid, live it
A wizard with weapons: the secret mission, we 'bout to begin it
Government funded, behind enemy lines
Bullets is sprayin', it's heatin' up a hundred degrees
The enemy's the North Vietnamese, bitch please!
Ain't no sweat, I'm totally at ease
Until I see the pilot got hit, and we 'bout to hit some trees
Tail rotor broke, crash land
American man in Cambodia, right in the enemy hand
Take a swig of the whiskey to calm us
Them yellow men wearin' black pajamas
They wanna harm us, they all up on us
Bang bang, bullet hit my chest, feel no pain
To my left, the Captain caught a bullet right in his brain
Body parts flyin', loss of limbs, explosions
Bad intentions, I see my best friend's intestines
Pray to the one above, it's rainin', I'm covered in mud
I think I'm dyin', I feel dizzy, I'm losin' blood
I see my childhood, I'm back in the arms of my mother
I see my whole life, I see Christ, I see bright lights
I see Israelites, Muslims and Christians at peace, no fights
Black, Whites, Asians, people of all types
I must've died, then I woke up, surprised I'm alive
I'm in a hospital bed, they rescued me, I survived
I escaped the war, came back
But ain't escape Agent Orange: two of my kids born handicapped
Spastic, quadriplegia, micro cephalic
Cerebral palsy, cortical blindness — name it, they had it
My son died, he ain't live
But I still try to think positive, ‘cause in life, God take, God give62EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In my historical oracle, I blast metaphorical
Editorials educatin' in my territorial
Get torn, heavily armed with seventy bombs
That'll blast divine like the heavenly psalm
Your men'll be gone if they explore my deepest thought
I beat hearts in two, then ask demons for chalk
I'm dreamin' to stalk emcees in the dark
I walk blindfolded, the mind's golden, watch how you talk
My style is a art, recognize lyrical purity
All hell breaks loose like a mall with no security
The dopest vocalist, with my third eye I focus with
I proceed, flow with the speed of a Indie motorist
There's more to this than wasted shiny chains and bracelets
I hit tracks, my tongue waits for the brains to blaze it
Amazin' angelic, tell it to your people
("Your mic and my mic, come on, yo, no equal")

Illadelph is like the Sun, 'cause we shine with rhymes
The underground is like the Moon: you only see us at times
And at times with light skies when the stars recline
Jedi Mind, Outerspace, coincide and combine

Raw poems, bury your body in catacombs
Rip your soul from your limbs like brims from Jim Jones
In the Twilight Zone we disperse cowards
Vampires that stalk earth on reverse hours
Night calls, we target your facade
My latitude is God, darts out my jaws leave eternal scars
You're left breathin' out of tube straws by the marksmen
Harnessin' science for demolishin' the charlatan
Raps will make you parallax
My domain has power to block synapse inside veins
War shots fired off by the army type warlocks
Devil's plan is to have you drip in the Clorox
Beast deceivin' us, ways devious
Possessin' my peeps to walk streets
With stolen heat, like Prometheus
Elements rushin' you back to hell again
Illadelphians crush your skeleton to fuckin' gelatin
Illadelph is like the Sun, 'cause we shine with rhymes
The underground is like the Moon: you only see us at times
And at times with light skies when the stars recline
Jedi Mind, Outerspace, coincide and combine

Don't ever come to me with war
I've severed scores of orators
Rappers fall onto all fours like minotaurs
With Jedi Mind and the Planetary be bombin' this
We stand one step above you like a pharmacist
With Ominous, detonate the bomb
Heads dread hallucinogenics since Vietnam
I spit a psalm, create bombs like an Iraqi
Swear on the Bible and then lie to Ecclesiastes
(Assault and battery)
Battle me, that'll be what splits you
Store enormous amounts of energy in a crystal
We boa constrict you, the gods are militant
You faggots couldn't go the length like you was impotent
You ignorant, your whole clique is split in half
You step in Allah path, and face Allah wrath, what!

Our friendship seemed to be based on what I could do for you, homie
The sad fact is I'm the type of person that would take two for you, homie
You ever give so much till a muhfucker can't give no more?
Give so much of his soul that he feel he can't live no more?
What you want from me? You want blood from me, want another dub from me, money?
You wanna drain me of every single motherfucking drop of love from me, money?
I can feel the eyes staring at me even when it's dark, even when it's cold
I can feel Allah staring at me even though I'm marked, even though I'm old
Y'all are just some "gimme" muhfuckers, "take more off Vinnie" muhfuckers
Never giving back, don't know how to act, just a bunch of shitty muhfuckers
Gradually night goes on, gradually life goes on
It's tearing me apart, never really thought that I'd have to right this wrong
I don't think I'm anti-love, I just think I'm anti-y'all
I just think I'm anti-every-muhfucker-tryna-plan-my-fall
I was never planning to be great,  something that began as a mistake
But me being me, mama always told me I should always share what's on the plate

And just waking up is enough of a struggle today
And most of these phonies that's close to me push me away
But there ain't no weeping I'm keeping this enemy deep in my veins
Cause I love the pain

And just waking up is enough of a struggle, I don't wanna deal with the darkness
Have a motherfucker laid up by himself tryna heal from the conflict
Ever have someone close to you tell you that you really can't when you can?
I wouldn't know nothing 'bout that bullshit and that's the stamp of a man
And the same one who blamed me, the same one who defamed me
Can't make his own cash, can't wipe his own ass like a baby
Everything is past or it's light, everything is passion and hate
Everything is everything and I don't think I need to keep a track of the date
Everybody take what I offer, everybody play like a pauper
The same ones with they hands out, be the same ones that hate when I prosper
Tryna be a gentleman of sorts, tryna be a better man, of course
Tryna set a living, understand that I'ma always be a veteran of loss
What's the physiology of love? What's the physiology of pain?
What's the physiology of every single person that will probably get to reign?
I don't like when liberty is wrong, I don't like when misery is gone
I can tell all y'all one thing: all y'all gone' miss me when I'm gone
And just waking up is enough of a struggle today
And most of these phonies that's close to me push me away
But there ain't no weeping I'm keeping this enemy deep in my veins
Cause I love the pain
And just waking up is enough of a struggle today

I know all the times were hard
I know that you've been feeling down
If you only knew how I'm feeling for you
If I could take your pain
I wish that I could wash it all away
If you only knew how I'm feeling

Mommy, I'm sorry if my first letter made you cry
To be honest with you, I don't think that I want to die
Sometimes I feel like that I'm cancerous in other's lives
That's probably why I drink at night and sleep 'til four or five
It's kind of hard walking through life with my distorted eyes
When I was younger, I was stupid and I thought I'd thrive
I thought a lot about everything I said in the letter
And questioned whether or not if I was dead, you'd be better
You think my shorty would be happy if I never met her?
It's too late now, mommy, I could never forget her
Could never forget how she taught me to love
Cause my father and my grandmother is always above
It's glory above, you know that daddy taught me to thug
And every time we was with nanny she'd bombard me with hugs
Damn, I miss her, mommy, and it's hard to believe
That I'm grown and I don't understand it, why did they leave?
It's better to die and sleep
Than never waking sleep
Than linger on and dare to live
When the soul's life is gone

You've been running around for so long
You've been hurting yourself too much
You keep messing around with darkness
You're the one who's losing
You've been running around for so long
You've been hurting yourself too much
You keep messing around with darkness
You're the one who's losing

Mommy, I think that I'mma try to stick around a while
I got a niece, and my nephews, they need me around a while
I think they need me cause they hitting that age
And they ain't trying to speak to Lenny cause they spitting they rage
Yeah, and mommy, speaking to Lenny, I think my brother need me
And we Italian, so you know my mother love to feed me
And it's the little things you do for me that make it worth it
Like when I play a joint that we did and you say it's perfect
And when Jake got knocked, you knew that I was hurt
You told me put all of my heart in the song, and it worked
I promised him that I'd be there when he got out the bing
You ain't raise me to be a liar, ma, that's not my thing
I told him that I'd hold him down the whole time that he gone
They kept him locked inside a cage, but that's cool, cause he's strong
So mommy, keep that first letter I wrote you on the low
I think I wanna stay alive and see if I can grow
You've been running around for so long
You've been hurting yourself too much
You keep messing around with darkness
You're the one who's losing
You've been running around for so long
You've been hurting yourself too much
You keep messing around with darkness
You're the one who's losing
"You have power and money, but you are mortal
You know you cannot escape death
But immortality can be obtained
The legend is always the same
If others have succeeded in conquering death
Why must we accept it?
I know where the immortals live
And how to obtain their secret
We too must become wise men
The elements of chemistry are many, but finite
So are the techniques of enlightenment"
I know all the times were hard
I know that you've been feeling down
If you only knew how I'm feeling for you
If I could take your pain
I wish that I could wash it all away
If you only knew how I'm feeling9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I, I who have nothing

Intersections in real time
The unbroken circle and dimensions of the mind
The tie that binds
The eternal tie that defines
The vanity of my insanity in due time
Will shine
Like the night seas under the moon
The haunted corners of familiar rooms
Yet I'm consumed
We're vanishing into thin air
The realization that this shit is my cross to bear
So where
Did I think I could run away to see
The people that decided to leave without asking me
But we
Decide to wait for happier tomorrows
And find someone so they can be distractions from our sorrow
But my distractions the books of paper that I scrawl in
I'm eloquent as summer breeze and leaves that have just fallen
I've crawled in a corner hoping all of this will end
With the knowledge that love is just another word for revenge
I who have nothing but the comfort of my sins
I who have nothing but the comfort of my friends
I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one

As I decay, demons prey above me like a vulture
Ability to endure contradiction is a high sign of culture
Verbal sculptures, self defacing
It is not God or lunacy that I am facing
But the erasing of the purity and passion of my words
The herds of cattle babble on with talk of the absurd
But I preferred
To walk away from all the feuds
To find my life is more confusing than a rubic's cube
So I'm subdued
In all my words of verbal prods
To live alone one must be an animal or a God
But it's official
All of my pain is clear as crystal
The natural side of life has now been seeming artificial
But I can hit you
And rest assured that I'mma last words
I could give a fuck about ya secrets and ya past words
I can pass words and their ability to hurt you
Patience is a virtue and knowledge is of commercial
I who have nothing but the pain that I refer to
I who have nothing but the pain that I've refered to

Lost among the miracles, I stand alone
And I've grown into a being that's sitting on top a throne
I've known
For many years that I would turn to rust
I find a reason for another breath
Before my return to dust
I become one with science and mathematics and the rising of the sun
I'm numb
To all of those who blind and cannot see
The chastiser of the enemy
Perception requires duality
Inspect ya soul, the color of coal inside the body
I have hardly come across them who's holy
Send them to the cherubim to control thee
Burning of the sun and frigidness of the cold
The battlefield is new but the war is now old
You can never see the merest shadow of a halo
Above the head of evil djin who's deadly like tornado
The world has become an aquarium
Full of gaping fish with murderous smiles
I on the other hand stand on the outside looking in
Writing down murderous files
I who have nothing but the lack of variation
And I who have nothing but chains and suffocation

Devise a spell, make demons rise out of hell
Grab you by your lapels and rob you of your outer shell
You feel the ill dire, messiah in hellfire

The mass'll here it, the ominous, the master spirit
Can't understand the language of rappers with bad lyrics
Ikon the python, rappers are left strangled
I overlook the Earth 'cause I see it from sun's angle
Above the clouds, we sit high and we dazed
Write a page, on how you enslaved to worldly ways
Islamic marksmen, seein' the squadron
Could be a fatal mistake
Like the first sins of Adam in the Garden
You feel sorrow, I'm projected as god Apollo
Explore rhymes, you're left too confused to follow
Invite your town to absorb the sniper rounds

Go to war for anybody who embraces Islam

I'll make a good girl a cum dumpster, Satan awaits
Set the razors to AKs and turn raisins to grapes
Turn blood into wine with an insatiable taste
Drink from the goblet of gore, vomiting porn
Sodom and Gomorrah back to Canarsie, New York

Is this the bringing of the king to his parliament?
Till the land was all undone and darkened by such deeds

Wait Ruck chill, what the deal it's all love though
Look into my eyes and you can tell there's something changed
Running gunning things knocking niggas out like Clubber Lang
The gun I bring is straight for fucking beating you down
Heating you down leaving you six feet deep in the ground
It's some real motherfuckers gon rock tonight
All your jewels and your cash getting got tonight
Or somebody in the club getting shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight

I'm the motherfucking ungrateful
My heart is hateful, my tongue ripped
Licking on the blade that slayed you
You faggots act as bitch as RuPaul
You niggas share one milkshake with two straws
You're trapped with no doors, four walls tighten
Seeing the roof fall, feeling the floors heighten
Crushed in shit, your bones and blood siphoned
And put into a jug we sip before fighting
I'm raw lightning; my power extends
In the planet and out through the opposite ends
Black man travel through the universe and back
While cavemen still though that the earth was flat
But we kept the sacred plans, now we carry
Throughout the ancient lands
Before the separating of the sands
When God saw the power I create in my hand
He banned my gene strain from replicating in man
 (x2)
It's some real motherfuckers going rot tonight
All your jewels and your cash getting got tonight
Or somebody in the club getting shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight

I'm tasteless; there's beauty in strange places
I find beauty in razors
I find beauty in blood dripping from ya faces
I find beauty in the Qur'an and all of its Aramaic equations
I find beauty in twelve gauges
I find beauty in teaching you what the definition of pain is
I find beauty in stainless
Steel that can kill and reveal the front of your grill
You're brainless
Y’all don't wanna test Vinnie Paz patience
I crack jaws and swing swords of the ancients
Y’all pretended to overstand the matrix
Without attempting to overstand its basics
We dedicated to cats that's been thugging
Vinnie Paz got more hoes then Jim Duggan
Y’all been ducking for quite some time now
Vinnie 'bout to teach you how to write some rhymes now
We aim beams in between your eyebrows
Jedi Mind, Sean P combine now
It's some real motherfuckers goin rot tonight
All your jewels and your cash gettin got tonight
Or somebody in the club gettin shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight

Don Corleone here to tell you about loyalty, respect
And underground shit...

The myth of a man let your bridges wither and dance
Oblivious now, primitive, I'm Olympian, now it's routed in pistols
Allow me to buy the album, child imbeciles
I was a coward out to intend powerful minutes for
The crowd, the men, the rowdy, loudest towered sour diesel
Out to seek a pile of reeking, reaching demons, wild deacons
Denial deep, denial seek the child
Teaching my own preaching means
And thinking why I'm leaving rhymes leaking by the evening
Who'da thought the hammer hit ya?
The Ruger spark, leave you handicapped, trapped in wheelchairs
Drop bomb, calm flow forming on
Important, I'm raw mob (Don Corleone)
Take this offer, the vengeance refuse to
Amend all you're used to, remember that you're useful
Uh, and the Godfather speaks
R.A. and Vinnie Paz, Stoupe on the beat
Let's go, Let's get it

You go against the family, you get buried
It's R.A., A-F-R-O, Stoupe and Vinnie P
Cause most these rappers nowadays is fairies
And y'all could never fuck with JMT
(Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist)
Yo, to the piano blue diablo, do an Amadou Diallo
Out the Kilimanjaro, animal, Italiano
Mario Bava giallo, I beat Apollo, you eat a hollow
Hole in your middle, look like a seed of avocado
Life gone, I'm beyond body harm, carry an arm in my palm
Leave you bloodier than Carrie at the prom
Man, Van Damme kick a foe
Mantan
Wigger, whoa Bam Bam Bigelow, bigger flow, Riddick Bowe
Summer eighties Bananarama, da ha da ha
Had the hammer to Alabama to where the crackers are
Animated Hanna Barbera rather Cameron Avatar
Stamina like the man out of Panama, Paz and Allah
Macking Mary Magdalene, Howard Hewett from Shalamar
Rapping assassin like I'm back with Rawkus and Agallah
Pill to a blondie, the ill Bill Cosby
Ill hobby, kill the body, Ingagi, I killed Gandhi
I like Chi-Lites, dice and knife fights
Mics syllables slang slit you, scissor precise slice
Sacrifice, lose suitable beautiful life price
And I could conquer the Devil and I could revise Christ, c'mon

You go against the family, you get buried
It's R.A., A-F-R-O, Stoupe and Vinnie P
Cause most these rappers nowadays is fairies
And y'all could never fuck with JMT
(Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist)
The mythical man, who come from indivisible fam
You pitiful fam, this shit is gon' get physical fam
You kicking the can, I'm visual like Dario Argento
Like stabbing you with a pencil inside of the instrumental
If that ain't what you was into, I'll slide inside of your mental
And provide you with a rhyme, that can silence the instrumental
I body you with the Ginsu, but that'll probably be drawn
It's not so hidden, the God economy gone
And I'mma probably be wrong and y'all will probably be on
The anomaly is how you'll be on a quality song
The bodies is on my lawn, the bodies have been deformed
The bodies have been piling up, but I've been silently calm
I had to sound the alarm, I had to try to get rid of em
Riddlin' with the Ritalin, little bit of adrenaline
A little bit of medicine in the middle of Ital' and
The only way to really begin again is to end again

You go against the family, you get buried
It's R.A., A-F-R-O, Stoupe and Vinnie P
Cause most these rappers nowadays is fairies
And y'all could never fuck with JMT
(Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist)

You know who I am
I'm back and ready to fight
You know who I am
Come out your belly and get shot drastically
You know who I am
I'm back and ready to fight
You know who I am25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

{"I leave the blood spilling in the streets"}

Yo, its the fucking Hologram, Jedi Mind baby
Bangin' ya'll in the fucking face, know what I'm sayin'
With the God Jus Allah, my man Stoupe on the track
My motherfucking man Chico in this motherfucker
We about to take ya'll motherfuckers to war
Nah'm sayin', yo Jus Allah, blow this fucking mic apart, God

The metal inside the barrel passes
Through the frames in your glasses
Quick passage, leave your dome piece backless
Envision blackness, leave you hat-less, fucking cap-less
Marchin' niggas to the spot where the Earth's crack is
Hard to grasp like science and math is
The cavemen who don't practice and live backwards
We oxen, when streets is watchin'
Release shotguns, niggas got Dietz and Watson
Feel no love, no way you shield the slugs
The ill thugs, we box with steel gloves
Doubt my faith you can taste the slug case
Leaving niggas looking like dogs with the pug face
Even your girl can catch the capsule
I love pussy but never the bitch that it's attached to
Why you wanna battle the kids with steel tongues?
Who rip up mics and drink puerto-rock rum
85's face the truth; you're too dumb
If retaliation comes, yo, then fuck it: it just comes

We itching to kill, that's why we spitting the real
Stick to the drill and maybe we'll be gripping a mill'
The clip will get spilled, dump them on a ditch or a hill
Because the motherfucker ain't left me shit in his will
And y'all is always sounding like a bitch when you spill
And we the rawest motherfucking clique in the field
So real motherfuckers better recognize real
Or ill motherfuckers gonna exercise skill
Y'all better chill when the Hologram build
Little motherfucker got hands that's like steel
Whoever approach me and what I feel
{"Might find their legs being replaced by steel"}
So y'all better yield or I'ma choke faggots
My hand held more razor blades than coke addicts
We like to quote fascists because we the meanest
And rip off your fingers with the pliers of Chaka Demus

Why you wanna battle with kids with steel tongues?
Who rip up mics and drink puerto-rock rum
85 face the truth; you're too dumb
If retaliation comes, yo, then fuck it: it just comes5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I built with Alexander the Great, he told the Persians they should stay gone
Then he told me about the Oracle of Ammon
He gave me no clue where it is
Men feared time yet time feared the pyramids
He gave me more jewels
He told me that Amenhotep was immortal
I can't overstand hieroglyph
So I called Killah Priest and he taught me how to follow it
I walked through the Valley of the Kings
With a white robe, white rose and Muwali rings
And your whole team Judas
My road thin, gold skin like Zeus'
I speak the dialog of the dead
I practiced the same war tactics in King Arthur's head
So let the swordsmen kill the beast
It's a Legacy of Blood with Vinnie Paz and Killah Priest

"The Sun Won't Come Out, unless the crowd start this
'Cause if it was my choice, you all dance in darkness"
"Elements burst and gave birth to the worst
Took the pen from the nurse and hold the mic up first"
"Put your rhymes, the rhymes, put your rhymes on the altar
Burn them as a sacrifice"
I paint flows with the feathers from the wings of angels
Red ink from saint blood, nigga you ain't thug
Stare into the face of a king's mug, crushed grape fill the wine jug
Ill thoughts build from the mind of rhyme, rose off the tongue like fine rugs
Let me walk you through this for the clueless
I'm Shakespearean with gray earrings
Speak like Tiberius, write novels
Spit it like Aristotle, face half Pharaoh
And half owl, I took the path of Cairo
Came back with the Dead Sea Gospel
Now known as the Dead Street Apostle
We see them Feds, shoot them hollows
Bullets spread till they meet Diablo
Stars in alignment, Priest meet with Jedi Mind Tricks
Reach them climates where you can't breath
Stay high off that dead weed
In the mind is where I plant seeds to grow fruit
Of king's so brute of army troops, mighty men in celestial suits
You need healing, my mic give you incredible boost
Where I use satellite dish and stare at my alphabetical soup
Plus I use the Big Dipper to take more than one scoop
It's Priesthood

"Straight up, we serve justice
So if they can't be trusted, may you return where the dust is"
"Put your rhymes on the alter
Burn them as a sacrifice"
"Elements burst and gave birth to the worst
Get the pen from the nurse and hook the mic up first"
"Put your rhymes on the altar
Burn them as a sacrifice"
I studied Element 115 with the Elohim
Saw the Canaanites, Sumerians and the Philistines
This is street gospel
If you don't believe in life on Mars, that mean the beast got you
You don't wanna see me and Killah Priest hostile
You don't wanna see desert eag' heat pop you
This is Mothman Prophecy
Walk back to the sand of Iraq and let the prophet breathe
We turned all our water into toxic seas
And walk in war with armor that I copped in Greece
Then I shot the beast with a long arrow
Studied Imhotep to be a strong Pharaoh
It's a war when the gods spit
It's Allah when I split the icebergs in the Arctic
I don't care what the cause is
And I'ma ride for my fam no matter what the cost is

Yeah, Vinnie Paz, Killah Priest, yeah
Priesthood, Maccabeez, yeah, Army of the Pharoahs
Aight? Yeah4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Torn apart now
I cannot have this combination
And fusion of your elixir
Torn apart now
These are the choices we've made
Do I swallow or walk away?

Most of my adult life I've been torn into two
If you love me, then I love you and this song is for you
It's tight hard when you know that you sick
And your shorty seeing you as an emotional wreck
The closer I get, it's like the farther I feel
And my heart has turned into this heavy armor and steel
It's hard to be real, hard to listen to the dumb shit
And I take a lot of pills cause it numbs shit
I wish I had another path to follow
Wish that I could be a man and learn to pass the bottle
A graphic novel, my future a box or an urn
Having dreams about death, but I'm not that concerned
And I'm diseased, through the seasons they turn
Watching leaves from the trees turn diseased and they burn
I'm eager to learn, but I'm holding my breath
And every day alive is just another closer to death

Yeah, I've been alive longer than I expected to be
And took care of everything that's expected of me
Took care of my girl and my mother
I told her that I'm always here and I love her
I handle shit differently cause I'm grown now
And the truth is that I'd rather be alone now
I'd rather not have to deal with the day
And I hate when people ask me how I'm feeling today
My brother Rasul, we had a beef and grudge
But we grew up together, cousin, so it's peace and love
I wish y'all the best, I wish y'all the shine
I wish I didn't wanna off my thoughts with a nine
I'm thoughtful and kind, but I'm evil alas
But everything I love has turned to a tedious task
I feel that life a waiting game for people to pass
But nobody ever want you to see through the mask


I don't wanna be a burden to y'all
I just wanna know exactly what my purpose is for
I feel like nothing I do is ever right
And that I'm acting a fool another night
And I admit, I don't take care of myself
So I do a lot of thinking and preparing myself
'Cause the fact is my father died young and I might too
And it ain't any way to tell what I might do
I don't wanna leave my mother behind
I don't want for her to cry, because the struggle is mine
I don't want for her to grind no more
I don't want for her to work a 9-to-5 no more
I ain't have to work a fucking 9-to-5 before
So I'm trying to get this money to provide for y'all
And if the shit ain't work out and I'm suddenly gone
Just remember that the motherfucking love isn't gone

To face what we are in the end
We stand before the light
And our true nature is revealed
Self-revelation is annihilation of self

Mummy, I don't wanna live no more
I don't think I got nothin' else to give no more
It's like I lost my passion for life
It's like all my actions are trife
I don't feel like I used to about the world
I don't feel like I used to about my girl
I just wanna die mummy cause it's too hard
I just wanna lie calmly and to view God
Ever since daddy died it's been pain mummy
It's like there's something wrong with my brain mummy
You was always there for me so I love you
I die for you and I place no one above you
Tell Lenny and the kids that you stay strong
And when I meet my maker that I'm gonna pray for'em
And tell P that I think he'll be a great father
Tell Young that I think he'll be a great author
Tell Planet that his wife and kids are gorgeous
And the same go for Andy and for Marcus
Tell Syze that I have faith in 'em
And never let the industry snakes get 'em
The entire world is a graveyard
(The ending of time)
We're the ones
(The ending of time)
Who let the dying know
(The ending of time)
The hour has come

I got a few things more I should say mummy
I never meant to hurt you in any way mummy
I never meant to hurt anyone, it's God's work
Cause wakin' up everyday for me is hard work
And tell June that she was the love of my life
And that I never stopped lovin' here even in spite
All the things that we went through together
Through the highs and lows and bad weather
Let Frank know he always made me smile
Tell him back in the days was crazy wild
Tell Stoupe that I always had his back, ma'
And we was meant to be together on a track, ma'
Tell Cheek I consider him a brother
When I die, the pain will spit into another
That's just how life goes ma, it's painful!
I'll come back to you in dreams as an angel
So don't blame yourself for what happened
Cause you was the best mother that I could fathom
So I'm going to the first place I can go
I love you, sincerely Vincenzo!

Mommy just tell everyone I love them know
What I'm saying? tell my man mike tell my magruff
Keep holding me down know what I mean?
Who let the dying know tell them to stay strong
Tell Devious to keep doing his thing mommy
The hour has come tell locke to keep his head up things
Gonna get better know what I'm saying?
Everything's going to be good for everybody it's just hard
Its just hard for me I know this may seem like its
The easy way out but its not the pain hurt
Tell everyone I love them and I always had their back
Yeah sincerely yours Vinnie Pazienza2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You know the Don's armed with sixteen
And I do harm for this big cream, the whips and the carriage
Ball like the Knicks and the Mavericks, slipping the fabrics
Pull up wit some big shit, lieutenant shit, hitting the hazards
Spot a bitch wit that Cris habit, gotta have it
Fuck shorty and send her OT wit a brick in her baggage
Roll where the clubs at slip for the rabbit
Trick only lick dick status to get cabbage
She get lathered to the dick baptist
Who back on the map? Giancana wit a vengeance
It's drama to the finish, put the Llama to your appendix
And squeezing the slugs, gun powder season your blood
I'm a legend breathing, the reason you thug (nigga)
This where the buck stops, fuck props
Buck shots at the top money, what the fuck you forgot?
Thought I was done and wasn't touching the block?
Still real, busting the Glock
Put up and you can see it (blaow) what up now?
(Chorus)
"I'll exile barbarian style like an executor"
Wanna test Vinnie Paz man (Jedi Mind Tricks)
Enforce the moves on fools
 I'm invincible
Everybody talks and they like I'm losing my head, I'm losing confidence and that I'm talking loud and vulgar
I'm talking vulgar because I'm angry at what I've experienced all my years through this and I'm just angry!
Everyone else has the right to be angry too but that's just how I express myself

Yo, bust a motherfucking gat to this
Y'all believe lies like y'all was Catholics
I rap in Arabic, so my message is just immaculate
My rap elaborate, drink a forty and blaze a sack to it
My aim is accurate, take your brain and blow out the back of it
I'm salty, miserable cat that slap shorties
Looks kinda resemble that, a fat Pauly
I don't even clap, young boy, he claps for me
Chain hang down to my dick, I'm that gaudy
I don't even fuck wit you cats, you rap poorly
I don't even buck at you cats, you that corny
Wit a wack army, we barkin' at you
And Vinnie Paz holds a hammer like a carpenter do
You should understand that I ain't really fuckin' around
And if you don't, you gonna find your body stuffed in the ground
We buckin' em down, cuz that's how wrong my life is
Y'all don't overstand how fuckin' strong my wife is
I'm from a time where every song was righteous
Before rap was just a swarm of white kids
And y'all a witness to the dawn of hypeness
Or just another victim to the pawns and sheisters
I'll feed your corpse to a swarm of vipers
Let em suck the blood till your form is lifeless
What! Fuckin' Vinnie Paz daddy! Jedi Mind Tricks! (Yeah!)

When I was a little kid, my mother told me not to stare into the sun. So once when I was six, I did. The doctors didn't know if my eyes would ever heal. I was terrified, alone in that darkness. Slowly, daylight crept in through the bandages, and I could see, but something else had changed inside of me

I'm the fire bearer, holder of the sun
The earth and the universe combined as one
An everlasting energy taking all forms
Blue skies on sunny days, terrible storms
The one who tears down what you adorn
And curses the material things that you mourn
But look up in the sky because I am the dawn
And the light that empowers your flesh as you yawn
Strong, undeniably so, Lif better known as a society foe
The deity glow reach into my center
I bet you feel pleasure and pain as you enter
The tormentor, pleaser, embracer, squeezer
As your skeleton crush, your physical turns into gelatin, plus
Due to over stimuli, you liquify
I send you back to the earth soil to quench the turmoil
When the ground splits to swallow of corporations and cops
Give birth to rocks so we can have solid ground on which to walk
Stand strong and talk and write down theories in chalk on the side walk

The devil lurks and my heart irks for the hell
Look into the eyes of a nigga who fell
The devil lurks and my heart irks for the hell
Look into the eyes of the...
My style orbits round nine planets of forces
Ominous metaphorics envision a devil corpses
Lion hoarder, mad scientist slash author
Present the type of horror that boils your holy water
Get warped with the knowledge that folds the holy father
Hard boys become toys inside the real saga
So why bother, my whole floor alliance is harder
So bring the drama, we all know that science is smarter
I set off crowds, style wild like a circus
I seek new souls when I walk past churches
Allah praise you, stay true to a devout purpose
Seeking out the wise wherever the God searches
Flows that I embark on leave your squadron shadow dodging
Lyrics assault men like slugs that fill harkness
No option, narrow odds
Fucking with gods is straight gambling with your tarot cards

The devil lurks and my heart irks for the hell
Look into the eyes of a nigga who fell
The devil lurks and my heart irks for the hell
Look into the eyes of the...

Open the gates of Midian for the fangs like the flesh
Three cyborgs who Bang like Ladesh
We hang the best, spit venom until your face burn
Yet the critics are parasitic like a tape worm
The hate burn, scathe the nerve of a Buddhist
Snake turn and fake yearns; the kiss of Judas
We take lives with knives steady abusing you
With the vicious intentions of denting your uvula
Bruising you with text of a Harvard class
Ikon will smash into shards of glass
To reform into a whirlwind of sand
Then reborn into the world Hologram
A solemn man with plans to entwine matter
Minds splatter from the grind of my divine hammer
The devil lurks and my heart irks for the hell
Look into the eyes of a nigga who fell
The devil lurks and my heart irks for the hell
Look into the eyes of the...

Enter the eye of the storm
Rappers just battle me for the glory
It gets gory
They shitty like suppositories, that's the end of the story
Bury his body in Missouri
Banish the apparatus of Gladys to crematories
My territory, perimeter of purgatory
Stingy in winches of vicious, malicious inflictions upon your click
Circulatory
Causing head spasms
Rip through your motherfucking temple like Phantasm
Hologram has'em and walks through the holy arches
Left you in the forest with your carcass in the harness
Death is upon us, we slam like Adrian Adonis
Swarm on the warm blood like malicious pirahnas
Islamic Bombers, no contender is parallel
When I'm on paper, devastate'em like 7L
So where I dwell, without question rattles the league
Left you in a vessel with severe battle fatigue
Before you leave I insist you listen to more raps
Before I saw cats, making weapons out of your thorax
De que te quiero, sí, te quiero, te quiero
De que te quiero, sí, te quiero, te quiero

I inhale toxins
Drunk off blood from dead cops and
The watchmen, that kill us in this maze we locked in
Side Cobra Clutch, only truth can sober us
Wild cause we know there's no Jehovah watching over us
Only 10 percent that's controlling us
Try to take our souls from us, while they stay patrolling us
Caged in we break barriers, change to new areas
Dodgin' the pigs in chariots out to bury us
Jus Allah don't make threats
Leave your fuckin' necks clipped
Have you speakin' the manual alphabet
Seein' me is def not repeated or done twice
I laugh as I cast the first stones at Christ
Joint in ace bands, you move to Graceland and Satan
Mics spray then, bury flesh in wasteland
Infect you
Inject you with the gunpowder pegs
Indent your forehead with hot lead
Whether in the abode of the dead
Or resting in the Zions
Allah stay chasin' the dough like wild lions
Unchained tearin' your flesh we unfed
Flyin' through, like birds we takin' your daily bread

De que te quiero, sí, te quiero, te quiero
De que te quiero, sí, te quiero, te quiero
De que te quiero, sí, te quiero, te quiero

Kindness of wooed and wooer
Seems shame to their love pure
O Love, your eyes lose lure
When I behold eyes blinded in my stead!
Your slender attitude
Trembles not exquisite like limbs knife-skewed
Rolling and rolling there
Where God seems not to care:
Till the fierce love they bear
Cramps them in death’s extreme decrepitude
Your voice sings not so soft,—
Though even as wind murmuring through raftered loft,—
Your dear voice is not dear
Gentle, and evening clear
As theirs whom none now hear
Now earth has stopped their piteous mouths that coughed7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah... Vinnie Paz, baby
Yeah... yeah... yeah

This is raw, all across the board, Liquid Sword Chamber
If it's coming from my jaw, then it's pure anger
Heavy metal rap, with a four four banger
We can settle that, let the mic cord hang ya
I play homage to the best of them, like Christopher Wallace
And bring drama to the rest of 'em, with biscuits from coppers
I'm with Allah justice, and we raw gritty
Picture hell, Illadel' to New York City
I brought a four with me, we can capture the ring
And now we more merciless than the Statue of Ming
And y'all more purposeless than a pacifist king
You gon' die, like a brawl with a gat in the Bing
It's a passionate thing, the way we make classics
Genuine brilliance or innate madness
Yeah, we all spin on the same axis
And this chrome thing here, leave your frame backless
The police always try'na aim flame at us
So I don't mind when the pig brain splatters
I don't mind, that we all gon' die soon
I return to the silence of God's tomb

Off or onstage, whatever, still kick it
With the footwork, of Freddie Adu, it's all new
Now the rap commissioners, they wanna clone my shoe
But the road's narrow, and it's difficult to climb
With the heat, the wind and the fallen rocks combined
It's hard to stay in line, the course is an obstacle
Within each chamber, the force is unstoppable
Lyrical swordsman, blades sharp, I cut out your heart
M.C.'s want no part, in any type of conflict
Because then I respond quick, it gets thick

So another year, another drama (Fuck you!)
She reportedly collapsed at a Hollywood nightclub
She looked like she was on something
Involuntary
Intoxicated

In the land of make believe, you are all mine
In the land of make believe, I’m doin' fine
In the land of make believe, you are all mine
In the land of make believe, I’m doin' fine

Turn the television off, cousin, that ain’t nothing for a girl to see
I got a niece and best believe she mean the world to me
And she don’t need to see the shit they think a girl should be
Ninety-pound skinny bitches, that ain’t even girl to me
Essentially, that shit designed to take a hold of you
Telling lies till your vision take control of you
They finding different ways to take your fucking soul from you
A show about a model make your self-esteem low for you
Everything is fake, trust me, no one that lovely
I met a lot of famous people and they fat and ugly
I ain’t any better, I just think the fact is funny
That they’ll take a little girl and pimp her for the cash and money
And what's gonna become of them in like fifty years
When Hannah Montana turnin' into Britney Spears?
They chew you up and spit you out 'cause no one really cares
And ain't nobody gonna hold you when you really scared
Where the parents at, cousin? This is really bad
Is this the motherfucking manager or really Dad?
Is he concerned about his daughter or a silly pad?
This ain't gon' change nothing, I just think it's really sad
In the land of make believe, you are all mine
In the land of make believe, I’m doin' fine
In the land of make believe, you are all mine
In the land of make believe, I’m doin' fine

Turn the television off, cousin, it’s a tool for them to clog the mind
Conservatism, liberalism, they divide the line
The natural feelings of a child is to be calm and kind
Then they show you ads for the Marines and they decide it's time
So they can send you to a war behind their father crime
Then send you home missing a limb and not provide a dime
And the news tell you cops is on the block for people
I'ma put it simple and plain, cops is evil
Take the television show Cops for example
That’s the shit that they want America to watch and sample
Never showing you how dirty that they really is
And that they hide behind they badge and that they really bitch
I ain't never met a pig in my life
That I ain't want to catch a body on the jig of my knife
Yeah, that’s another fucking topic for another day
I'ma tell you how they'll try to get you in another way
They tell you that there’s something wrong with you, you need they drugs
But there ain’t nothing fucking wrong with you, they being thugs
They sell drugs in commercials, at the same time
Lock a motherfucker up for the same crime
In the land of make believe, you are all mine
In the land of make believe, I’m doin' fine
In the land of make believe, you are all mine
In the land of make believe, I’m doin' fine
In the land of make believe, you are all mine
In the land of make believe, I’m doin' fine
In the land of make believe, you are all mine
In the land of make believe, I’m doin' fine3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
