I thought I saw you yesterday
But I didn't stop, ‘cause you was walking the opposite way
I guess I could have shouted out your name
But even if it was you, I don't know what I would say
We can sit and reminisce about the old school
Maybe share a cigarette because we both fools
Chop it up and compare perspectives
Life, love, stress, and setbacks
Yes, you could tell me how hard you had it
And you could show me all the scars to back it
And we can analyze each complaint
Break it down and explain these mistakes I make
I like to tangle up the strings of the puppetry
But you knew me back when I was a younger me
You've seen Sean in all types of light
And I've been meaning to ask you if I'm doing alright

Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?
Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?
I'm shook, I know I pushed when I should have pulled
Took it all back if I could, I put that on my soul
And I would make a top notch good listener
If you could block off a little time out to give it here
Since we went our separate paths
I've hit a couple of snags that remind me of the past
I can't front, I'm having a blast
But damned if I ain't afraid of how long it's gonna last
Sitting here wishing we could kick it
Give me your opinions, I do miss the criticisms
I didn't mean to be distant, make a visit
I'll wait up and keep the coffee brewing in the kitchen
But who am I jokin' with?
There's no way that you and I will ever get to re-open it
It doesn't matter, this is more than love
And maybe if I'm lucky, get to see you out the corner of…

Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?
Yesterday, was that you? Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?
And when you left, I didn't see it coming
I guess I slept, it ain't like you was running
You crept out the front door slow
And I was so self-absorbed I didn't even know
And by the the time I looked up, it was booked up
Put it all behind you, the bad and the good stuff
A whole house full of dreams and steps
I think you'd be impressed with the pieces I kept
You disappeared, but the history is still here
That's why I try not to cry over spilt beer
I can't even get mad that you're gone
Leaving me was probably the best thing you ever taught me
I'm sorry, it's official
I was a fistful, I didn't keep it simple
Chip on the shoulder, anger in my veins
Had so much hatred now it brings me shame
Never thought about the world without you
And I promise that I'll never say another bad word about you
I thought I saw you yesterday
But I know it wasn't you, ‘cause you passed away, Dad
Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath, reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy ‘cause I miss you?51EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"Hey, hey what are you doing over there?"
"I... I'm just standing, I..."
"Come here, come here. What are you doing?"
"I'm just waiting for... You know he's... He might come out."
"Left you standing in the rain all wet."
"Wait, I just wanna say..."
"No, no, who are you waiting for?"
"A guy I met at the show."
"Who, Slug? You're waiting for fucking Slug?"
"No! I mean no, uhh, yeah."
"Oh no, you're... You're fucking kidding me."
"He's so hot."
(unintelligable)
"Fucking Slug? Oh my God, he is so fucking ugly."

I wear my scars like the rings on a pimp
I live life like the captain of a sinking ship
The one thing that I can guarantee
I'm like a stepping razor, I suggest you stay fair with me
Been paying dues for a decade plus
Before that I was just another face on the bus
Tappin' my foot, to the beat on the radio
Dreaming 'bout the mic and the money and the ladies
Oh mom, I promise I'm gonna be large
Some day I'ma stop trying to borrow your car
Gonna go far, with charisma and skill
Until they put my face on a million dollar bill
Atmosphere, it's just a ten letter word
Discretion is the name of my cement-feathered bird
And if you didn't hear, then fuck what others heard
I think you got the sickness, I suggest you get it cured
Caught up in the mix of a bottle full of fix
I'mma hobble down the street till I reach Knob Creek
It's not that I don't like you, I just don't want to speak
You fucking freak, now keep your days out my week
The world keeps a balance, through mathematics
Defined by whatever you've added and subtracted
I'm pushin' on the hammer to trigger the brain
Embrace how I live, 'cause God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly

Once upon a time in Minneapolis, yo
I damn near had to steal the show
I stepped on the stage - "Who is it?"
My name's Slug, I've come to kill a couple minutes
And what's up with the way that everybody gathers around
Each other, so they can steal each others' sound
If it's all about getting down, with the get down
How long I gotta wait for these fools to sit down?
Appears more clear in its simplest form
Nobody sees tears when you're standin' in the storm
Abandonin' the norm, and handlin' the harvest
Measurin' the worth by the depth of the hardship
I welcome all the hatred you can aim at my name
I held onto the sacred ways of how to play the game
When the soldiers started runnin' short on rations
I began tappin' the egg to spark the hatchin'
Make it happen, and take this captain to the gallows
I keep steering us into an area that's shallow
Talking to my shadow, he advised me not to worry
Said, I should plant my tree and let it rise out of the fury
So give me some light, a little love and some liquid
I'ma creep through the night and put a plug in the spigot
And when the water grows, and the dam starts to overflow
I'll float atop the flood holdin' on to my ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly

Why scream, when you can lose yourself inside the widescreen
Let life be a bowl of melted ice cream
Or be the deer that's caught in my high beams
I'm rolling with the brights on
Scared stiff, reality is just too much to bear with
Paranoid, walking around, careless
No wonder you're in love with your therapist
Go to sleep my little time bomb

God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly
God loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly33EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Ain't no way to explain or say
How painful the hangover was today
In front of the toilet, hands and knees
Trying to breathe in between the dry heaves
My baby made me some coffee
Afraid that if I drink some it's probably coming right back out me
Couple of advil, relax and chill
At a standstill with how bad I feel
I think I need to smell fresh air
So I stepped out the back door and fell down the stairs
The sunlight hit me dead in the eye
Like it's mad that I gave half the day to last night
My bad sight made me trip on my ass, right into that patch of grass like that's life
All of a sudden, I realize something
The weather is amazing, even the birds are bumpin
Stood up and took a look and a breath
And there's that bike that I forgot that I possessed
Never really seen exercise as friendly
But I think something's telling me to ride that 10 speed
The brakes are broken, it's alright
The tires got air and the chain seems tight
Hopped on and felt the summertime
It reminds me of one of them Musab lines like

Sunshine, sunshine, it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines, whoah let it shine
Sunshine, sunshine, it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines, whoah let it shine
Sunshine, sunshine, it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines, whoah let it shine
Sunshine, sunshine, it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines, whoah let it shine
If I could I would keep this feeling in a plastic jar
Bust it out whenever someone's actin hard
Settle down, barbeque in the backyard
The kids get treats and old folks get classic cars
Every day that gets to pass is a success
And every woman looks better in a sun dress
The sunshine's an excuse to shoot hoops, get juice
Show improve their moves and let loose
I hear voices, I see smiles to match em
Good times and you can feel it in the fashion
Even though the heat cooks up the action
The streets still got butterflies
Enough kids to catch 'em
Ridin my bike around these lakes man
Feelin like I finally figured out my escape plan
Take it all and the day started off all wrong
Somehow now that hangover is all gone
Ain't nothing like the sound of the leaves
When the breeze penetrates these southside trees
Leanin' up against one, watchin the vibe
Forgettin' all about the stress, thanking god I'm alive
It's so simple, I had to keep the song simple
When I get home I'm gonna open all the windows
Feelin' all right, stopped at a stop sign
A car pulled up, bumpin Fresh Prince's Summertime
Summer summers fine
Feel it in my skin, warming up my mind
Sometimes you gotta give in to win
I love the days when it shines, woah let it shine
Woah let it shine
Woah let it shine
Woah let it shine
Woah let it29EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Head, pressure, senses, clutch
Date, divinity, wouldn't, fuck
Touched, hazy, God, change
Rush, floor, life, veins
Head, pressure, senses, clutched
Date, divinity, wouldn't, fuck
Touched, hazy, God, change
Rush, floor, life

From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins
From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins

It goes one for the cannabis, and two for your Dianetics
Three for the reasoning, and four for those that try to get it
Five for your love and six for the stress
And seven for the day that I climbed into this mess
From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
I made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
And I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
And caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins

I'm catching ulcers from the child-proof lighters
And all of these fine-tooth biters that keep the wires in my head tighter
I'm tired out by the distances achieved walking in my sleep
Thoughts got shifted since the high got a tad too deep
Ask dad to keep cool, I'll call him back soon as I resume normal
And get out of this bathroom
And call management to seek some reimbursement
For the nerve endings that burnt from the first hits

From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins
Head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
And I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins
So fuck needles, fuck smoke
Fuck lines that make the sinus choke
Fuck chasers, trails, fuck waves and rails
Fuck hangovers, fuck hallucinations
Regurgitations, mandatory sentences and UA tracing
Blind my insight and dull the common sense
Give me inhibition, kill the superstition and the confidence
Built a tolerance, now it's more that I consume
And when it boards up my room, the world's whores will croon in unison
Unify the eulogy
Autopsy pages read euthanasia, i.e. irony
Well, here I be within a pool of my drool
Sedated, windows dilated, comatose, life overdose
Tell Jacob Miles to keep it wild style
I promise I'll smile
And check the floor, God's got nice tile
Tell Jacob Miles to keep that shit wild style
And I'll smile
And check the floor, God's got nice tile

From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
Made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
And I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change
Caught a rush on the floor from the life in my veins
From a head full of pressure wrest the senses that I clutch
I made a date with divinity, but she wouldn't let me fuck
And I got touched by a hazy shade of God-help-me-change

They love the taste of blood
Now I don't know what that means, but I know that I mean it
Maybe they're as evil as they seem
Or maybe I only look out the window when it's scenic
Atmosphere finally made a good record
Yeah right, that shit almost sounds convincing
The last time I felt as sick and contradictive as this
Was the last time we played a show in Cincy
"Get real", they tell me
If only they knew how real this life really gets
They would stop acting like a silly bitch
They would respect the cock whether or not they believed in it

Doesn't take much and that's messed up
Because these people do a lot of simple shit to impress us
While everyone was trying to out-do the last man
I was just a ghost trying to catch some Ms. Pac-man
Hello ma'am, would you be interested
In some sexual positions and emotional investments
See, I'm not insane, in fact I'm kind of rational
When I be asking, "Yo where did all the passion go?"
East coast, West coast, down South, Midwest
Nowadays everybody knows how to get fresh
Somebody give me a big yes
God bless America, but she stole the B from Bless (and kept it)
Now I'm too fucked up to dance
So I'mma sit with my hand down the front of my pants
You can't achieve your goals if you don't take that chance
So go pry open that trunk and get those amps
In the days of Kings and Queens I was a jester
Treat me like a God or they treat me like a leper
You see me move back and forth between both
I'm trying to find a balance
I'm trying to build a balance

So now I keep a close eye on my pets
Because they make most of they moves off of instinct and scents
It's eat, sleep, fuck, and self-defense
So straight you can set your clocks and place bets
Wait, let's prey on the blind, deaf, dumb, dead
Hustle, maybe a couple will love what you said
Emcees drag their feet across a big naked land
With an empty bag of seed and a fake shake of hand
Yeah, I got some last words, fuck all of ya'll
Stop writing raps and go play volleyball
Gotta journey the world in a hurry
Cause my attorney didn't put enough girls on the jury
Guilty of dropping these bombs in the city
But I'm innocent, love is the motive, that's why I'm killing 'em
Guilty of setting my fire in all fifty
But I'm innocent, blame it on my equilibrium

In the days of Kings and Queens I was a jester
Treat me like a God or they treat me like a leper
You see me move back and forth between both
I'm trying to find a balance
I'm trying to build a balance
Now all my friends are famous
It's either one thing or another
They all don't know what my name is
Probably know both of my brothers
The one is a hard workin' savior
The other's a hard workin' soldier
I'm just your next-door neighbor
Working hard at tryin' to stay sober
You wait for the car at the corner
Pretend like you know what the plot is
Won't quit till I hit California
And make you my Golden State goddess11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It - leave - never - would - you - you - show - could - I - if

She say that she still wants a friendship
She can't live her life without me as a friend
I can't figure out why I give a damn to what she wants
I don't understand the now before the then
Most of this garbage I write that these people seem to like
Is about you and how I let you infect my life
And if they got to know you, I doubt that they would see it
They'd wonder what I showed you, how you could leave it
A friend in Chicago said that I should stay persistent
If I stay around I'm bound to break resistance
Fuck you, Lucy, for defining my existence
Fuck you and your differences
Ever since I was a young lad with a part-time dad
It was hard to find happiness inside of what I had
I studied my mother, I digested her pain
And vowed no women on my path would have to walk the same
Travel like sound across the fate ladder
I travel with spoon to mix this cake batter
And I travel with feel, so I can deal with touch
It's like that, thank you very much, fuck you very much

(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Fuck the 'What happened?' I got stuck
They can peel pieces of me off the grill of her truck
Used to walk with luck, used to hold her hand
Fell behind and played the role of a slower man
I want to stand on top of this mountain and yell
I want to wake up and break up this lake of hell
I feel like a bitch for letting the sheet twist me up
The last star-fighter was wounded, time to give it up
On a pick it up mission, kept it bitter
Gettin' in a million memories just to forget her
The difficulty in keepin' emotions controlled
Cookies for the road, took me by the soul
Hunger for the drama, hunger for the nurture
Gonna take it further, the hurt feels like murder
Interpret the eyes, read the lines on her face
The sunshine is fake, how much time did I waste?
Fuck you, Lucy, for leaving me
Fuck you, Lucy, for not needing me
I wanna say fuck you because I still love you
No, I'm not okay, and I don't know what to do

(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Do I sound mad? Well I guess I'm a little pissed
Every action has a point, five points make a fist
You close em', you swing em', it's hurts when it hits
And the truth can be a bitch, but if the boot fits
I got an idea, you should get a tattoo that says warning
That's all, just a warning, so the potential victim can take a left
And save breath, and avoid you, sober and upset in the morning
I wanna scream, "Fuck you, Lucy"
But the problem is I love you, Lucy
So instead I'ma finish my drink and have another
While you think about how you used to be my lover

(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
(Yes, yes it is)
And everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love
Everyone in his life would mistake it as love

The first time I met the devil was at a Motel 6
She left hell to spend a weekend on Earth just for kicks
Sexy little bitch, shorter than expected
About 5 foot 5, big and thick in the breast and thighs
Beautiful, dark eyes, a strong stare
Large lips, soft hands, and long hair
I said I'll make you smile for the simple fact I'm good at it
I'll make you smile just so I can sit and look at it

I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle
I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle

Who cares what Jane says? She always spits the same spit
I'd rather kill the radio and listen to the rain hit
Little sister needs seclusion, some how she'll discover it through the pop music
Got used to the feeling of falling, but she'll never see her following
Bouncing back and forth between the healing and the hollering
Riding the outer ring of your own private saturn
Thoughts scattered all across the grey matter
Little baby doll she doesn't know what to say to ya'll
The patience is short and of course the pride is way too tall
Break it all smash the past like it was made of glass
Ain't no other way to make it last
It hurts to watch Lucy lucid dream
I've had the pleasure of seeing our hero kick and scream
And when she calms down I'll turn the sound down
And put my arms around the little lost and found and I'll tell her that
I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle
I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle

Hush little lady don't say a word
Or the rest of the village gonna know you're disturbed
And if you let them know that you're vulnerable
Then there ain't no stopping how far they open you slow (yo yo yo)
I'm a chapter in your textbook read me like a checkbook
Mistook love at first sight for a sex look
Enough of the blind man's bluff
I want the good stuff
Trying to hook up a full belly and a foot rub
The modern man's hustle I dig it, I shuffle
Feed me your troubles and need me to cuddle (come on)
Bundle up in my mitten and coat
As cold as it gets I keep your winter afloat
So let the snow fall (it's coming down)
She doesn't want to understand why I still come around
She looks at the mirror, she don't see what I see
She holds no history of how precious she be
Lay your head on my chest, speak of the stress
Kick your feet up and rest, before we clean up the nest
I hate to see you upset, it cramps the position
And if you didn't know, you better listen (you better listen 'cause)
I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle
I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

To all my killers and my hundred dollar billers
To emo kids that got too many feelings
He held the register open while he counted her change
I was next in line which meant I was invisible
From where I stood I could see that the till was full
He didn't look the type to play superhero
So I stepped forth and paid for my cigarettes
Crept out the store's front door to chase a little breath
Bangles in my head, shake the song off
Another manic Monday night, its gonna be a long walk
A car pulled up, a fixed up Cutlass
A woman and a child climbed out and left it running
They went inside of the deli, placed an order
With the extra dollar fifty bottled water cause the daughter's picky
When they came out mommy gave me a glance
That said man can love an angel but he's got to take the chance
Already knew the deal, I lit one up and walked
So they got back in they Oldsmobile, belted up, and took off
Thug love on the corner by the Walgreens
Looking at me like I'm just another square Saltine
As I get closer I notice they showing each other sketches
Out of their notebooks, reminded me of my old roots
I walk past with a nod and a reminisce
Swear to god hip hop and comic books was my genesis
Respect the life and the fashions of the children
It's the only culture I've got, exactly what we've been building
All of a sudden I'm in front of some man
No, he's a young'un, but he's got a gun in his hand
He looks fifteen, he looks frantic, no, he looks afraid
Immediately apprehensive 'til I heard him say
"Do you want this? It's not mine, I promise
I found it on my block in between a couple garages
Didn't want to leave it for a child to stumble over
I don't even know how to hold it"
It was a thirty eight, the poor man's machete
Held it in my hand, thinking damn man it's heavier than expected
Wedged it behind my belt buckle
Knowing that it's evil, even thought that I could smell trouble
The extra strength felt weak
But over there on the corner saw what I needed
And proceeded to cross the street
Put the heat in the mail box to lose it
Figured that the post office knows what's best to do with it
Mosey down the road, thinking about the old
I used to roam this zone through two feet of snow
Right here, this used to be a record shop
I've gotten love, I've gotten drunk, I've gotten beat up in that parking lot
I've had my Lake Street pride for 3 decades
These alleyways, and these streetlights have seen my best days
Before I was a germ learning how to misbehave
All the way to the grave, south side is my resting place
Took a right on Lyndale I'm getting near
But then the road became empty and the people disappeared
The clouds ran away, opened up the sky
And one by one I watched every constellation die
And there I was frozen, standing in my backyard
Face to face, eye to eye, staring at the last star
I should've known, walked all the way home
To find that she wasn't here, I was still all alone
No matter where I am, no matter what I do
I'm always coming back home to you
They can leave me for dead they can take away my true
I'm always coming back home to you
Through the lies and the sins that ride the wind that blew
I'm always coming back home to you
As sure as the life in the garden that you grew
I'm always coming back home to you
No matter where I am, no matter what I do
I'm always coming back home to you
If only I had known what you already knew
I'm always coming back home to you
From the heaven I've had to the hell I been through
I'm always coming back home to you
I'm always coming back home to you15EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's no surprise I overslept
Put my boots on and climbed out my tent
I didn't see you, assumed you were sleeping
Immediately start a fire cause it's freezing
I can't believe we went camping in the cold
I'm in the wilderness standing in some snow
A late start, but we can still catch up
You need to wake up, we should eat and then pack up

That's when I noticed your foot prints
The snow's fresh and those have been put since
What, you're already up making the rounds?
So where you at now, you laid back down?
The breeze came and it stalled out the flame
While I went to your tent and called out your name
You didn't answer, so I opened up the flap
It's just an empty sleeping bag and your backpack

I'm looking at your tracks and You took a couple laps
Around the campground and hoofed down the path
I figure you'll return, no concern
I'mma hold put and try to make this cold wood burn
The wind is blowing strong, minutes rolling on
It's going on at least a half an hour you've been gone
It ain't right, start the paranoia
I left the camp site to go and search for ya
I read the trail your feet made
Each step was deliberately placed
It looks like you know where it leads
But I see nothing but leafless frozen trees
About a quarter mile into the course
Another set of tracks appeared next to yours
From the north it came out of the thick woods
And those footprints belong to a big wolf

Trying to find service on my cellphone
I felt aight with my knife on my belt, though
I hope the wolf is intimidated by you
I wondered if you even knew what was behind you
Stalking ya, maybe watching ya
Waiting for the opportunity to hop on top of ya
Salivating', wanna take ya to the stomach
In the cartoons you would have turned into a drumstick

And it gets about as bad it goes
Cause I notice there's a new set of tracks in the snow
I understood, it doesn't look good
Your fan club doubled, now you've got another wolf
And the odds are in favor of the home team
Why'd you walk off all alone, where you going?
It ain't the right time to complain, but
It feels like I'm trying to find your remains
Your foot prints grew further apart
I knew what that meant and it was hurting my heart
It means you started to run, so I did the same
Now my breaths looking like a steam engine train
Suddenly your tracks dip off of the path
And so did theirs, so my knife I grabbed
Into the forest, expect the worst
Adrenaline burst disturbed the nerves

50 yards into the woods and brush
It got so thick that it looked like dusk
The air stood serene, sober
It seemed like a good 15 degrees colder
And I'll admit: Hell yeah, I felt fear
The sound of my heart beat was all I could hear
Looking at the snow it was plain and clear
There was a third set of wolf prints where yours disappeared

I can't process, I don't follow
It would be easier to believe that you were swallowed
With no sign of death, no sign of struggle
No signs of blood, no signs of trouble
And the wolves never stopped
The tracks kept going and I took off
So I don't know how your story ends
But I know I'll never go into those woods again
It's not that tragic, it's not a shame
You're not the hunted, you're not the aim
You just another dog with hunger pains
I was so afraid that you'd become the game
I forgot to worry about what you became
You're not the hunted, you're not the aim
You just another dog with hunger pains
I was so afraid that you'd become the game
I forgot to worry about what you became7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands up like you give a damn and a fuck, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah

She said she want somebody she could take care of
And right then is when we paired up
Pull a chair up and make a space for yourself
You should taste what I felt
It's probable that those on the bottom gonna hold you accountable
It's lonely at the top and it's also hostile
Everyone got their own course full of obstacles
Don't let your heart grow cold like a popsicle
She said she want someone to treat her as an equal
And right then we started speeding towards Reno
Burning rubber in a burgundy Regal
Fly like the dove then dive like an eagle
I'm a 70 deuce, that year was a classic
Buzz got loose and we're here trying to catch it
She said that she was unimpressed
That's when I stood up and did the Kanye West

Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands up like you give a damn and a fuck, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
She said she needed a place to feel free
And right then we started building a team
Trying to make a better perfect, a little purpose
The only thing for certain is the sleep disturbance
But ever since people started measuring time
We've been looking for an easy way to settle our mind
Take a load off or take your clothes off
Or shut your eyes and roll straight for the roadblock
She said she needed something that she could blame
And right then is when I offered my name
It's the only thing I've got that'll always remain
So I'mma share it with you, so you can complain too
She said she want to find a cure for death
I know she meant that in the purest sense
But when I finally die, put on your Sunday best
Then throw your hands in the sky like Kanye West

Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah
Put your hands up like you give a damn and a fuck, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put your hands in the air like you really do care, oh yeah

You need to prove nothing to me
The time got a price, but the trouble is free
If we gonna struggle I'mma do it comfortably
And live life like I love to breathe
You need to prove nothing to me
The time got a price, but the trouble is free
If we gonna struggle I'mma do it comfortably
And live life like I love to breathe
Oh yeah, oh yeah20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

These warehouse wages kill the ends introduction
Man, I should've schooled it up when I was younger, should’ve stuck to plan
Always had the dreams of bein' more self-assertive
And my kid's a teenager now he needs the health insurance
So break my body, break break my soul down
Just another zombie walkin' blindly through your ghost town
Pull up to the bar to politic and tap the power
Ain't nobody really all that jolly at your happy hour
But I don't want to go home yet
So I'ma talk to my cigarette and that television set
It doesn't matter what brand or station
Anything that take away from the current situation
No overtime pay, no holiday
Months behind on everything but the lottery
Winter 'round the corner guaranteein' that my car dies
Wifey havin' trouble tryin' to juggle both the part-times
My cup ain't close to filled up
We tryin' to build up so we can have enough
And when I finally get the color won't be nothin' left to paint on
A friend of mine tried to kill himself to the same song
Do-do-do-do-do-doo
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-doo

My better half is mad at makin' magic out of canned goods
My tax bracket status got her questionin' my manhood
My shorty got caught smokin' weed at a concert
And if I smack him everybody treats me like a monster
My neighbors ain't doin' much better
And we makin' competition instead of stickin' together
Can't save no nest egg, in fact this nest is rented
In fact that rent is late, wait
The money ain't here, the raise ain't comin'
Just me and my son and that crazy woman
And those bartenders, this whole fuckin' country
Got everybody swallowin' that lunch meat
Well maybe we can speed up the process
Kill me in my thirties in the name of progress
Put me in the dirt and then change the topic
Sometimes seems like the only way to stop it
Contemplate my departure date
Doesn't take a lot to get a lot of us to talk this way
Take a shot at me that's all I'm obligated for
Apparently my only guarantee is a walk away
Do-do-do-do-do-doo
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-doo
The only guarantee in life
Is a life worth dyin' for
'Cause death don't wait for no one
He's sittin' on your front door
The only guarantee in life
Is a life worth dyin' for'Cause death don't wait for no one

Camera thief
Take pictures
Run like the parallel stitches
Attach my feet to the path I beat
Teach myself to keep the answers brief
Gnash my teeth like the last to feast
Imagine me on that abandoned beach
Sand and sea as if the jazz was free
I’m Ice cream mixed with gasoline
Direct attention to the craftsmanship
Neglect to mention that the past will stick
Like initials carved in the concrete
Like the tattoo that hides on your mommy
I still kick it with angels
The difference is instead of the bar, I’m at my kitchen table
The starlight shines through the glass
But you feel safe underneath that mask

Ferris Wheel, give rides
The scars healed in time to get high
Lock the doors and hide the keys
Let's go describe how to climb a tree
Don’t sign the lease just cop a corner
For you to curl up and try to sleep
Those cheap police won't find my wings
I keep my dreams inside my dreams
And If I had a time machine
I’d probably use it like a vacuum and try to clean
It kind a seems, quite more than a handful of these regrets have been circumstantial
Now give me all the cash out the drawer
Touch that mustache down on the floor
And I’ll be in court holding a pitchfork
'Fore I let the contest outlast the sport
Pocket watch, impatient
Find a mate then make the migration
Break the rules, but first break the rulers
And keep it moving like a rumor
I don’t need to defend my defensiveness
I keep to myself, my family, and friendships
I’ve got enough people I could disappoint
If you disagree I think you missed the point
Now go ahead and grab a chair
Let me tell you about the last few years
Pulled out a sack full of Samson’s hair
And put it on the dash like a dancin’ bear
I wrote you a horoscope
It won't fit on this post-it note
But if I had to sum it up into a shorter quote
It goes fuck it, you might as well row that boat24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I used to know this woman who had the most beautiful
Tattoos on the top sides of both of her hands
She was forty-three years old and as far as I know
Had never yet been with a man
It's not that she wasn't attractive;
She was beautiful, but it was the way that she interacted
She was aggressively passive to the point where she
Would've intimidated any mitt that ever tried to catch it
On the right hand she had a tattoo of a nude girl
She claimed it is what God resembled
But on the left she had a mirrored image of the same female
And this one she explained looked like the devil
I remember once watching her touch her own breasts
How the tattoos smiled as they stared down her stomach
As if anticipating when they'd be allowed to caress
The sweet flower that they both seemed too hunger (sweet flower)
Now maybe I was high but it felt so right
Heaven and hell both take to this woman's womb
It didn't make sense how she could commence
Touching herself with me wide awake in the same room
But if I've learned anything in my years (my years)
I learned I no longer believe in surprise (in surprise)
But what happened next damn near stole my tears
The tattoos came alive right in front of my eyes
They both slowly stood up and climbed off her hands
And showed me why she never took some time with a man
They climbed deep inside of this woman's garden
She closed her eyes and she gently bit her bottom lip
I stepped I left and I don't regret leaving
And I'd never forget all the things I saw that evening
A glimpse of religion a piece of coming closer
To understanding more about what intrigues me most
I didn't get turned on I just got turned
I wasn't as aroused as I was concerned
For each one of em I've hurt
And every time I've been burned
I've got a lot to teach but even more to learn
So now I keep my eyes open hoping to take in all I can
About woman taking in all she can
And for as long as I breathe I'll save a seat in my memory
For that woman with the tattooed hands
There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desire
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's the caffeine, the nicotine, the milligrams of tar
It's my habitat, it needs to be cleaned, it's my car
It's the fast talk they use to abuse and feed my brain
It's the cat box, it needs to be changed, it's the pain
It's women, it's the plight for power, it's government
It's the way you're given knowledge, slow with thought control and subtle hints
It's rubbing it, it's itching it, it's applying cream
It's the foreigners sightseeing with high beams, it's in my dreams
It's the monsters that I conjure, it's the marijuana
It's embarrassment, displacement, it's where I wander
It's my genre, it's Madonna's videos
It's game shows, it's cheap liquor, blunts, and bumper stickers with rainbows
It's angels, demons, gods, it's the white devils
It's the monitors, the soundman, it's the motherfucking mic levels
It's gas fumes, fast food, Tommy Hil', and mommy's pill
Columbia House Music Club, designer drugs, and rhyming thugs
It's bloods, crips, fives, six
It's stick up kids
It's Christian conservative terrorists, it's porno flicks
It's the east coast, no it's the west coast
It's public schools, it's asbestos
It's mentholated, it's techno
It's sleep, life, and death
It's speed, coke, and meth
It's hay fever, pain relievers, oral sex, and smoker's breath
It stretches for as far as the eye can see
It's reality, fuck it, it's everything but me
On and on and on and on
The list goes on and on and on and on
It's all according that life on a whole
It's in the water, it's in the air, it's in the meat
It's indirect, indiscrete, inconsistent, incomplete
It's in the streets, every city and everywhere you go
In every man it's the insanity, the fantasy, the casualties
It's the health care system, it's welfare victims
It's assault weapons, it's television religion, and it's false lessons
It's cops, police, pigs with badges, guns, and sticks
It's harassment and a complex you carry when you're running shit
It's wondering if you get to eat, it's the heat
It's the winter, the weather
It's herpes, and it's forever
It's the virus that takes the lives of the weak and the strong
It's the drama that keeps on between me and my seed's mom
It's that need to speak long, it's that hunger for attention
It's the wack, who attack songs of redemption
It's prevention, It's the first solution
It's loose, it's out for retribution
It's mental pollution, and public execution
It's the nails that keep my hands and feet to these boards
It's the part time job that governs what you can afford
It's the fear, it's the fake
It's clear it can make time stop
And leave you stranded in the year of the snake
It's the dollar, yen, pound, it's all denominations
It's hourly wages for your professional observations
It's on your face and it's in your eyes
It's everything you be
Cause it ain't me, motherfucker, cause it ain't me, uh

Enough to hold you to the brightest of lights
To place you dangerously close to that sun
Enough to acknowledge the flaws you can't ignore
And recognize the cause of what's done is done
More than enough to put my name behind my ideals
And neglect my logic twice daily
Enough to keep me looking for my Lucy in the sky with gems
When I remember how you used to call me baby
Enough to look in my mirror with detest
For every tear you shed regardless of why you wept
Enough to curse any man who can't appreciate the depth
Of the ocean I swam till I ran out of breath

I love you, don't ever fucking question that
That's why we'll probably never get along
If I was better at finding the right words to say
I wouldn't need to write these motherfucking songs
I love you, I love you (faded)
Never, don't ever fucking question that
Don't ever fucking question that

Riding the public transit, I study the blank stares
To answer my questions of how and why I got so many grey hairs
I take care of the nervous that runs through my extension cord
And I reflect on that reoccurring dream where we met the Lord
Single file lines, to give her a pound one at a time
But when I faced her, I attempted to embrace her, she looked so fine
I awokened from my sleep before her bodyguard had a chance to beat me
To submission and I still walk with my religion
I watched the children scurry in circles around a two-way mirror
Worrying about which side of the glass projects the reflection clearer
I hear the whispers of the wind trying to get me to grin
Gassing me up about the love that I plucked and I've been stuck within
For every eclipse that stares at me
From the other side of a paper cup of espresso
I light a match beneath a kettle
And for ever set of lips that become attached and equipped with that program
To seek success, I bleed my ethics out a slow drip
I know a man who met a woman, don't remember where
Big beautiful eyes and light brown hair
She was from the 'burbs, he was from the south side of the city
This was back when Franklin Avenue was still pretty
Two different worlds apart, but the world is just a small town
We all know how people like to get down
Here we go, Aquarius, Pisces
Feel the flow of the fluid as I swim through it to free my soul
Push shoved to came, without the glove, numbed the pain
The magic from up above what it does for the brain
Make the love, paint the picture, write the song
The player met a virgin, made a Virgo, named him Sean
Make the love, paint the picture, write the song
The player met a virgin, made a Virgo, named him Sean
Make the love, paint the picture, and write that song
Till the break of dawn

I love you, don't ever fucking question that
That's why we'll probably never get along
If I was better at finding the right words to say
I wouldn't need to write these motherfucking songs8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm sparked, waiting for the dark to hit
Cause once the moon gets above my apartment
I catch fits for starting shit
I'm smart with it, I give it that special touch when I push it
Cause I'm also a label rep, and I can't allow no bullshit
So shush kid, shush baby! Shut your eyes
Lay your head back, shed the fear and let the tears crystallize
I wish the flies to land upon your forehead
When I extract the essence from your head
And leave your body resting Moorhead
I left more dead reputations than HIV can
But for every killing there's a reason and it's not just MC's, man!
I'm watching C-SPAN, waiting for the first state rep
To take the first step, to have to kill off to make this world perfect
Well lets get shit right, right here! Right now! Right away!
Atmosphere motherfucker! If I need to I could fly away
I'll grind you and your weak crew into beef stew
Serve you with seafood
You can't cloud my vision cuz you're see-through

You need to recognize the size of the Atmos
You ain't as tall as half this - Madness- past what you practice
RSE you can't fuck with my tactics, you bastard
Thats why you breath fast bitch - no need to ask
We dug the fingernails underneath the skin of your scalp, then peeled it
Sent your underdeveloped pre-school style on a field trip
Now bite your tongue, this is how the mic gets stung
A whole tree to pick some fruit from, man!
You had to choose the ripest one

That said it all, it comes from inside, and how you ride
The sound wire when it's live and the vibes feelin right
Catchin' the motion given by rhythms when you hit 'em on time
With lines, makin' sure your rhyme soundin' tight
Your voice should travel without the babble of the average emcee
So listen please use discretion when you breath
Sound is vibration, I choose to use it with a vision
And then comes the style and precision...

No more longer will we hold your hands
Why? Cause you're too damn old
Oh yea, the network called
They told me to tell ya you've been cancelled
They also said big up for all the support
Thanks to your devotion, they now control the world
So let your hair down and eat the poison with a tall glass of Tang
I'm rising past the bank, with smile I'm flashin my fangs
I tumble over some, cuz some I don't over stand
I got the plot from Spawn, from now on, I know the plan
It's the noise it makes, that generates the passion I have
It's the void it breaks, that stimulates when mics get grabbed
It takes shape - escapes from these vocal chords I have
Atmosphere: music makers from the Rhymesayers lab

Come now, who fi me gwan test the giants when we apply this
Vice grips to your eyelids to make you read the fine print
The tyrants that gave you crisis, left you silenced
Don't breath a sigh of relief 'till you hear the rescue sirens

Supreme, be this team, we got this shit on lock
RSE we hid the key under an upscale rock
So you could knock all you want to but you ain't gettin' in
You could try to crash the door but you ain't gettin' in
Nigga, what! My definition is raw, I got you all
Wishin' I'd fall, so things could get better for y'all
But I'm tall, and got game, remain the same for the duration
Area code 6-1-2, my present location...

Atmosphere...embellished with talent and the wisdom not abuse it
Blessed with insight, friends and influences
Thats what keeps us dope, what makes us dope is the surroundings
Inspiration stems from love and stress compounding
Stamina: that is achieved over the course of time
In fact, time taught me how to breath, battle, not to court my mind
Defined as lyricist - the Atmosphericist
Makin sure you fear this hit every time you hear this shit
 Sound is vibration
 This sound is taken
 Sound is vibration
 And the ground is shaken
 Vibration is sound
 Yo, we found your replacement
 Vibration is sound
 Now who makes the sound?
 : Now who makes the music/sound? (*fades out*)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Individually wrapped, placed in neat little rows
Becoming a piece of everything that grows
Some numbers, a name, to indicate you played the game
Came empty handed and left the same
A soul is a soul and a shell is a shell
The border in between is full of everything you felt
Some cling to a cross 'cause they're tired and lost
They leave it up to the weather to measure the cost
And every time I look within I recognize the darkness
Familiar to the image of the artist
Staring at the bathroom mirror in a stranger's apartment
Can't remember her name, don't remember how I got here
But here I am, thinking about death again
Humbles out the stress, helps the breath get in
I need to check my friends as well as my next of kin
To let 'em all know I love 'em all until the end
And when the soul begins to reap, I think she'll know me from the sleep
I keep caught in the corner of my bloodshot eyes
And if she has the nerve to let me dump a couple last words
I'm gonna turn to the earth and scream "Love your life!"
Love your life, quite cliché, but I guess that's me
A ball of pop culture with some arms and feet
As discreet as I've tried to keep the drama and cancer
It's no secret that I hunger for someone to feed the answers
I never expected a bowl of cherries
I'm just a Virgo trying to find my own version of the Virgin Mary
And when I let them carry me to a cemetery
I wanna be buried with a pocket full of clarity

Now, how many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius
How many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius

Let no tears to fall from none of y'all
Just remember it all, the beauty as well as the flaws
L-O-V-E L-I-F-E
Here lies Sean, finally free
And as I look across the sea, I smile at the sun
While it feeds the weeds, the nutrition they need
The people still breathe, the city still bleeds
I'mma love it to death and keep planting my seeds
I'mma love it to death and keep an eye on the seeds
I'll be in love till I'm dead, I keep reaching the seeds
I'll give all I got left just to teach you to read
Love life to the death and keep planting my seeds
And when the soul begins to reap, I think she'll know me from the sleep
I keep caught in the corner of my bloodshot eyes
And if she has the nerve to let me dump a couple last words
I'm gonna turn to the earth and scream (Love your life)

Now, how many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius
How many times must you prove you're an angel
How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream
Before I finally figure out if you're insane or a genius
Lovelife, lovelife, lovelife, lovelife
Lovelife, lovelife, lovelife, lovelife
Lovelife, lovelife, lovelife, lovelife
Lovelife, lovelife, lovelife, lovelife
(Outro)
Life, love, stress and setbacks

One little flicker of light
Can erase the dark
One little flicker of light
Can erase the dark

Yeah I been drinkin’, You already know
Do I smell like escape? Probably so
I found your tape in my old collection
Put it in pushed play then I poured a fresh one
I look back with a hesitant laugh
But in reality it’s dark down memory ave
All the trials and suffering we shared with each other
A lot of people thought that we were actually brothers
You know me, you know I’m a control freak
Who told you, you could die before me?
Gone, another dog lost to the wild
I feel like a snot-nosed child
And when I hear your Smile
Its outlined in sadness
You poked holes in the magic
You taught jokes to the clowns
That never learned how
To appreciate the lights
Before the bulbs burned out
Flicker
One little flicker of light
Can erase the dark
One little flicker of light
Can erase the dark

Yeah, I been thinking, You already know
Do I sound frustrated? Probably so
Sometimes I feel guilty, I was out on the road
If I’da seen where it was going I’da stopped the whole show
I realize it ain’t realistic
I keep tryna make the pieces fit with
The info presented
I felt resentment
I held this against myself
I wanna help my friend
It stays in my head
That I was on a stage when you were laying in bed
Body was discovered by your own mother
It penetrates my chest, I still taste the regret
That I slept through a late night call from your homie
But then I spoke with Siddiq the next morning
And then I smoked one million cigarettes
Go figure, maybe I was tryna catch up with ya
Flicker
One little flicker of light
Can erase the dark
One little flicker of light
Can erase the dark

Yeah I been sinkin’, you already know
Do I look exhausted? Probably so
I don’t get much sleep
I’m not sick, I’m fine
I’m just tryna make the most of this limited time
And I’m missing you but I ain’t gonna lie
The distance grew between Eye and I
And at the end, even though we didn’t speak enough
You were easily one of the best people I’ve loved
Now I’m tryna write a song for a dead songwriter
That wrote they own songs about life and death
And every breath is full of self-awareness
Don’t ever be afraid to be embarrassed
So I wrote these words to describe what I cry about
But I’m certain if you were here right now
You’d ridicule these lyrics, you’d hate this chorus
You’d probably tell me that the concept is too straight forward
Flicker
One little flicker of light
Can erase the dark
One little flicker of light
Can erase the dark22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Dear Jacob
I won't take up too much of you time
I know you're trying to get your video game-grind on
And that's fine
Just gimme a second to empty my face
Before I hit the road again to go and win this paper chase
I've been watching you and
I'm proud of you man
You're growing up to be the best man that you possibly can
I know you understand
Why I go out of town
I also know my days are colder when you're not around
Sometimes I wonder what it's like to be adapted to the fact
That daddy never lived inside the same shack
And sometimes I get this pain in my stomach's pit
It's what I get
I'm convinced it's my punishment
For those nights I got drunk and let go at some bar
In some city with some people I don't know
For all the times that the lines on your face
Reminded me of the days before the dragonflies escaped
It trips me out how you pick up all my traits
From the way that you spit to the fists that you make
I watch the way you try to keep your mom happy
Daddy learned that from you
You're supposed to learn that from daddy
I can't teach much when it comes to women
I drive safe and slow but don't know nothing 'bout the engine
You're doing good little man that's all I really meant
I love you
You're my best friend, thanks for listening
Dear Craig, what up bones? How it goes?
Yeah, me? Well, you know, you know, same old, same old
Sorry that the phone calls ain't too routine
Just been runnin' around the globe tryin' to do my thing
Sometimes the weeks fly a little too fast
And sometimes I go to sleep a little too trashed
Other times I'm not sittin' on enough cash
And other times today feels too much like the past
Sometimes at night I would watch y'all fight
A child wonderin'
Why your life just ain't alright?
What's the violence about? Why's it in my house?
And even the memories are turned up too loud
Yeah, I got some issues in my head
Knew we should've started fixing 'em back when she left you
I'm not trying to get you down, I know you're different now
But your little man just wants you to listen now
I'm over 30, can't maintain relations
All these women want to hurt me and I just don't have the patience
I can't trust them, and they're not much help
When they start to push and pull the buttons I don't trust myself
What pride, fists, and words just might do?
I'm afraid of my fate, don't wanna turn out like you
I've never hit a woman
I won't do coke
And for that alone I love you and I want to thank you, old man
Dear Sean, what's going on? Not much to say
Just checkin' in with you, trying to see what's wrong today
I know there's gotta be something kicking your bruises
How's the love? How's the music? How's the self-abusiveness?
Got a lot to lose, it's breaking your shoulders
So you let your paranoia place your bets for you
Too many cigarettes, messing up your voice
Too many arguments, trying to test your poise
The only women that love you are fans and family
Mom has no choice, but fans leave you randomly
No heavy rotation in any location
You're not ready to face that you have no steady vocation
Plus you're getting old, your raps are exhausted
Stop it, everybody knows that you've lost it
Singing for these kids you don't know
When you should be at home with your own instead you're on the telephone
Fighting with your girl like it's you against the world
Another drunk hotel bedroom corner, curled up like a naked fetus
Come and save him Jesus
Place him back in time before the Reaganomics and Adidas
Sometimes you're not impressed with the work you've done
And love isn't love if you didn't hurt someone
Your son says, "Hi dad", your dad says, "What's up?"
And me, I wanna thank you, but I won't, I'll just say, "Good luck."15EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

A city full of people and my favorite is that waitress
And she treats me like some type of common vagrant
I see her every day, but there's nothing to say
Unless I decide to step inside of that cafe
I only get to sit if I buy something to eat
Otherwise it's best to keep my feet moving down that street
And god damn she's a hard bitch
Talks at me like I'm the bad dog that got into the garbage
Yeah I know that the toilet is for customers
You ain't got to tangle up the strings to make this puppet work
It doesn't have to be a game of patty cake
But it ain't like you don't know I sleep in that alleyway
And by the way, I can see it in your eyes
You're angry with your life, not a stranger to the fight
I bet you hate every man that you date
And you're probably addicted to all types of escape
You take it out on me that you're all alone
When you know you got your own closet full of hollow bones
Watch the tone when you speak to old folks
I'm grown, just trying to get out of this Minnesota cold

Look lady, I'm homeless, I'm crazy
I'm so hopeless I'm suicidal daily
If you and I can't co-exist, let's fake it
'Cause I ain't got the energy it takes for this relationship
I'm waiting for a city bus to flatten me
And transport me to the ever after happily
Maybe reincarnated with luck
Come back to Earth as a cockroach in your tip cup
She said she's had it up to here
She's gonna call authorities if I don't disappear
I love her threats, it rejuvenates my breath
I give her stress for the reaction that it gets
I got a pocket full of panhandled money
On a cup of bad coffee and a stale honey bun
In front of everyone she calls me bum
But she notices my absence on them afternoons I don't come
So here I am, thorn in her hip
Holding down the corner table all morning with some corn chips
Ignoring the insults and evil eyes
I feed off of 'em, I wonder when she'll realize
That she's the only reason I visit
The only woman in my world that acknowledges my existence
And if my ship ever comes, I'll miss it
Because I'm getting old and I ain't got much left to give it
So there it is and I have to live with it
I had the chance to make a difference, but I didn't
In the cafe bathroom drinking free tap water
Thinking: "Damn, I should've been a better father to my daughter"7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
