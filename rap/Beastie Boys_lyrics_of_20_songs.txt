Well, now, don't you tell me to smile
You stick around, I'll make it worth your while
Got numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe it's because I'm so versatile
Style, profile

I said it always brings me back when I hear, "ooh child"
From the Hudson River out to the Nile
I run the marathons 'til the very last mile

Well, if you battle me, I will revile
People always saying my style is wild
You've got gall, you've got guile (guile)
To step to me, I’m a rapophile
If you wanna battle, you're in denial
Coming from Uranus to check my style
Go ahead; put my rhymes on trial
Cast you off into exile

Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic

Jazz and AWOL, that's our team
Step inside the party, disrupt the whole scene
When it comes to beats, well, I'm a fiend
I like my sugar with coffee and cream

Well, I gotta keep it going, keep it going full steam
Too sweet to be sour; too nice to be mean
Well, on the tough guy style, I'm not too keen
Trying to change the world, I will plot and scheme

Mario C likes to keep it clean (clean)
Goin' to shine like a sunbeam
Keep on rapping 'cause that's my dream
Got an A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes
Now when it comes to envy, y'all is green
Jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine ('tine)

We're from the family tree of old school hip-hop
Kick off your shoes and relax your socks
The rhymes will spread just like a pox
'Cause the music is live, like an electric shock

I am known to do the wop (wop)
Also known for the Flintstone Flop
Tammy D getting biz on the crop (crop)
Beatsie Boys known to let the beat
"MMM, D-r-r-rop!"
Do it
Now when I wrote graffiti, my name was Slop
If my rap's soup, my beats is stock
Step from the table when I start to chop
I'm the lumberjack, DJ Adrock

If you try to knock me, you'll get mocked
I'll stir fry you in my wok
Your knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop
Like a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock

I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'ma set it straight, this Watergate
I can't stand rockin' when I'm in here
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fuckin' thorn in my side
Oh my god, it's a mirage
I'm tellin' y'all, it's sabotage

So, so, so, so listen up, 'cause you can't say nothin'
You'll shut me down with a push of your button
But, yo, I'm out and I'm gone
I'll tell you now, I keep it on and on

'Cause what you see, you might not get
And we can bet, so don't you get souped yet
Scheming on a thing, that's a mirage
I'm trying to tell you now, it's sabotage

Whhhhhyyyyyy
(Our backs are now against the wall)
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage

I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm-a set it straight, this Watergate
But I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place
Because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel
I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be – it's a mirage
You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage29EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Now here's a little story I've got to tell
About three bad brothers you know so well
It started way back in history
With Ad-Rock, MCA, (and me) Mike D
Been had a little horsey named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsey and a quart of beer
Riding across the land, kicking up sand
Sheriff's posse's on my tail 'cause I'm in demand
One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself without nobody
The sun is beating down on my baseball hat
The air is getting hot, the beer is getting flat
Looking for a girl, I ran into a guy
His name was MCA, I said, "Howdy," he said, "Hi"

He told a little story that sounded well-rehearsed
Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand, and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip
He said, "Can I get some?" – I said, "You can't get none!"
Had a chance to run, pulled out his shotgun
Quick on the draw, I thought I'd be dead
He put the gun to my head, and this is what he said:
"Now my name is MCA, I've got a license to kill (yeah)
I think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill (yeah)
Now what do we have here, an outlaw and his beer? (uh huh)
I run this land, you understand? I've made myself clear?"
We stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grin
You think this story's over, but it's ready to begin
Now I got the gun, you got the brew
You got two choices of what you can do
It's not a tough decision, as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me
I said, "I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter."
I did it like this, I did it like that
I did it with a wiffleball bat
So I'm on the run, the cop got my gun
And right about now it's time to have some fun
The King Ad-Rock, that is my name
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne
We rode for 6 hours, then we hit the spot
The beat was a-bumping, and the girlies was hot
This dude was staring like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar
MCA said, "Yippie Yo, you know this kid?"
I said I didn't, but I know he did
The kid said, ("Get ready, 'cause this ain't funny
My name's Mike D, and I'm about to get money"
Pulled out the jammy,  I aimed it at the sky)
He yelled ("Stick 'em up!") and let two fly
Hands went up, and people hit the floor
He wasted two kids that ran for the door
("I'm Mike D, and I get respect
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect")
MCA was with it, and he's my ace
So I grabbed the piano player, and I punched him in the face
Piano player's out, the music stopped
His boy had beef, and he got dropped
Mike D grabbed the money (MCA snatched the gold)
I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

To Mario C—you can't front on that

Well just plug me in just like I was Eddie Harris
You're eating crazy cheese like you would think I'm from Paris
You know I get fly, you think I get high
You know that I'm gone and I'm-a tell you all why

So tell me who are you dissing; maybe I'm missing
The reason that you're smiling or wyling, so listen
In my head, I just want to take 'em down
Imagination set loose and I'm gonna shake 'em down

Let it flow like a mud-slide
When I get on, I like to ride and glide
I've got depth of perception in my text, y'all
I get props at my mention 'cause I vex, y'all

So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want? (what'cha want?)
I get so funny with my money that you flaunt
I said, "Where'd you get your information from, huh?
You think that you can front when revelation comes?"
(Yeah, you can't front on that)

Well they call me Mike D, the ever-loving man
I'm like Spoonie Gee (whoo ooh), I'm the metropolitician (yeyeyeyeah)
You scream and you holler about my Chevy Impala
But the sweat is getting wet around the ring around your collar

But like a dream I'm flowing without no stopping
Sweeter than a cherry pie with Reddi Whip topping
Going from mic to mic, kickin' it wall to wall
Well I'll be calling out to people like a casting call

Ah, well, it's wack when you're jacked in the back of a ride
With your know, with your flow, when you're out getting by
Believe me, what you see is what you get
And you see me, I'm coming off as you can bet

Well I think I'm losing my mind, this time
This time I'm losing my mind; that's right
I said I think I'm losing my mind, this time
This time, I'm losing my mind
Yeah, you can't front on that

But little do you know about something that I talk about
I'm tired of driving, it's due time that I walkabout
But in the meantime, I'm wise to the demise
I've got eyes in the back of my head so I realize

Well I'm Dr. Spock, I'm here to rock, y'all
I want you off the wall, if you're playing the wall
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)

Y'all suckers write me checks and then they bounce
So I reach into my pocket for the fresh amount
See, I'm the long leaner Victor the Cleaner
I'm the illest motherfucker from here to Gardena

Well I'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce
You've got the rhyme and reason, but got no cause
But if you're hot to trot, you think you're slicker than grease
I've got news for you crews, you'll be sucking like a leech
Yeah, you can't front on that

So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

No sleep till
Brooklyn

Foot on the pedal, never ever false metal
Engine running hotter than a boiling kettle
My job's ain't a job, it's a damn good time
City to city, I'm running my rhymes
On location, touring around the nation
Beastie Boys always on vacation
Itchy trigger finger, but a stable turntable
I do what I do best because I'm illing and able
Ain't no faking, your money I'm taking
Going coast to coast watch all the girlies shaking
While you're at the job working nine-to-five
The Beastie Boys at the Garden cold kicking it live

No sleep till
Another plane, another train
Another bottle in the brain
Another girl, another fight
Another drive all night

Our manager's crazy, he always smokes dust
He's got his own room at the back of the bus
Tour around the world, you rock around the clock
Plane to hotel, girls on the jock
We're trashing hotels like it's going out of style
Getting paid along the way 'cause it's worth your while
Four on the floor, Ad-Rock's out the door
MCA's in the back 'cause he's skeezing with a whore
We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back
White boys got more rhymes
No sleep till
No sleep till Brooklyn
No sleep till Brooklyn

Ain't seen the light since we started this band
So, MCA, get on the mic, my man!

Born and bred in Brooklyn USA
They call me Adam Yauch, but I'm MCA
Like a lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon
I sip the def ale with all the fly women
Limos, arenas, and TV shows
Autographed pictures and classy hoes
Step off, Holmes, get out of my way!
Taxing little girlies from here to L.A.
Waking up before I get to sleep
'Cause I'll be rocking this party eight days a week

No sleep till
No sleep till Brooklyn
No sleep till Brooklyn
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (yeah)

No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)
No (no) sleep (sleep) till Brooklyn (Brooklyn)

Yeah!
Kick it!

You wake up late for school, man, you don't wanna go
You ask your mom, "Please?", but she still says, "No!"
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk

You gotta fight!
For your right!
To party!

Your pop caught you smoking, and he said, "No way!"
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag (Busted!)

You gotta fight for your right to party
You gotta fight

Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said, “What's that noise?"
Aw, Mom, you're just jealous it's the Beastie Boys

You gotta fight for your right to party
You gotta fight for your right to party

And on the cool check-in
Centerstage on the mic
And we puttin' it on wax;
It's the new style

Four and three and two and one (What up?)
And when I'm on the mic—the suckers run (Word!)
Down with Ad-Rock and Mike D, and you ain't
And I got more juice than Picasso got paint
Got rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick
I'm not surprised you're on my dick (Mike D!)
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
What up, Mike D?
Aw—yeah—that's me
I got franks and pork and beans
Always bust the new routines
I get it, I got it—I know it's good
The rhymes I write—you wish you would
I'm never in training, my voice is not straining
People always biting, and I'm sick of complaining
So I went into the locker room during classes
Went into your locker, and I smashed your glasses
You're from Secaucus—I'm from Manhattan
You're jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin'
("There it is")
Kick it!

Father to many—married to none
And in case you're unaware: I carry a gun (Word)
Stepped into the party—the place was over-packed
Saw the kid that dissed my homeboy, shot him in the back
Man, I had to get a beeper 'cause my phone is tapped
You better keep your mouth shut 'cause I'm fully strapped
I got money in the bank—I can still get high
That's why your girlfriend thinks that I'm so fly
I've got money and juice—twin sisters in my bed
Their father had envy, so I shot him in the head
If I played guitar, I'd be Jimmy Page
The girlies I like are underage (Shh! Check it)
Girls with boyfriends are the kinds I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike
My father—he's jealous 'cause I'm making that green (What up?)
I've got a list of girlies' numbers from the places I've been

("There it is")
Kick it!
You wanna know why? Because I'm—
October 31st, that is my date of birth
I got to the party, you know what I did? The Smurf!
Taxin' all the females, from coast to coast
And when I get my fill, I'm chilly most
We ragtag girlies back at the hotel
And then we all switch places when I ring the bell
I chill at White Castle 'cause it's the best
But I'm fly at Fatburger when—when he's—I'm way out west (Check it)
Check; K-I-N-G A-D—whammy!
All the fine ladies, they're on my jammy
Went to the prom—wore the fly blue rental
Got six girlies in my Lincoln Continental
I met a girl at the party, and she started to flirt
I told her some rhymes, and she pulled up her skirt (Check it)
Spent some bank, got a high powered jumbo
Rolled up a wooly—what'd he do?—and I watched Columbo

Let me clear my throat
Kick it over here, baby pop
And let all the fly skimmies feel the beat—
Mmm—drop

Coolin' on the corner on a hot summer's  day
Just me, my posse, and—MCA
A lot of beer, a lot of girls, and a lot of cursin'
.22 automatic on my person
Got my hand in my pocket and my finger's on the trigger
My posse's gettin' big—and my posse's gettin' bigger
Some voices got treble—some voices got bass
We got the kind of voices that are in your face!
Like the bun to the burger—and like the burger to the bun
Like the cherry—to the apple—to the peach—to the plum
I'm the King of the Ave.—and I'm the king of the block
Well, I'm MCA—and I'm the King Ad-Rock
Well, I'm Mike D—I got all the fly juice
On the checkin' at the party on the Forty Deuce
Walking down the block with the fresh fly threads
Beastie Boys—fly the biggest heads
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho...
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho...
Brooklyn, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho...9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I love you

'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Mike D, come and rock the sure shot

I've got the brand new doo-doo, guaranteed like Yoo-hoo
I'm on like Dr. John, yeah, Mr. Zu Zu
I'm a newlywed, not a divorcee (yeah)
And everything I do is funky like Lee Dorsey
Well it's the taking of the Pelham 1, 2, 3
If you want a doo doo rhyme, then come see me
I've got the savoir faire with the unique rhymin'
I keep it on and on, it's never quitting time and
Strictly handheld is the style I go
Never rock the mic with the pantyhose
I strap on my ear goggles and I'm ready to go
‘Cause at the boards is the man, they call the Mario
You pull up at the function and you know I Kojak
To all the party people that are on my Bozac
I've got more action than my man, John Woo
And I've got mad hits like I was Rod Carew (yeah)
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
You know you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Ad-Rock, come and rock the sure shot

Hurra-, Hurra-
Cane will cross fade on your ass and bust your eardrums
Listen everybody cause I'm shifting gears
I'm fresh like Dougie when I get my specs
And on the microphone, I come correct
Timing like a clock when I rock the hip-hop
Top notch is my stock on the soapbox
I've got more rhymes than I've got gray hairs
And that's a lot because I've got my share (oohh, weee)
I've got a hole in my head and there's no one to fix it
I gotta straighten my thoughts
I'm thinking too much (yeah) sick shit
Everyone just takes and takes, takes, takes, takes
I'll have to step back, I gotta contemplate
Well, I'm like Lee Perry, I'm very on
Rock the microphone, and then I'm gone
I'm like Vaughn Bode, I'm a Cheech Wizard
Never quittin', so won't you listen
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, yes, indeed, it's fun time

'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
MCA, come and rock the sure shot

I want to say a little something that's long overdue
The disrespect to women has got to be through
To all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and friends
I want to offer my love and respect to the end
Well, you say I'm twenty-something and I should be slacking
But I'm working harder than ever and you could call it macking
So I'm supposed to sit upon my couch just watching my TV
I'm still listening to wax, I'm not using the CD
Well, I'm that kid in the corner
All fucked up and I wanna so I'm gonna (yeah)
Take a piece of the pie, why not, I'm not quittin'
Think I'm-a change up my style just to fit in
I keep my underwear up with a piece of elastic
I use a bullshit mic that's made out of plastic
To send my rhymes out to all the nations
Like Ma Bell, I got the ill communication
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Keep on and rockin' the sure shot

Girls – all I really want is girls
And in the morning it's girls
'Cause in the evening it's girls
I like the way that they walk
And it's chill to hear them talk
And I can always make 'em smile
From White Castle to the Nile
Back in the day
There was this girl around the way
She liked my home-piece MCA
He said he would not give her play
I asked him, "Please?" – he said, "You may."
Her pants were tight, and that's ok
If she would dance, I would DJ
We took a walk down to the bay
I hope she'll say
"Hey, me and you should hit the hay!"
I asked her out, she said "No way!"
I should've probably guessed her gay
So I broke north with no delay
I heard she moved real far away
That was two years ago this May
I seen her just the other day
Jackin' Mike D. to my dismay
Girls – to do the dishes
Girls – to clean up my room
Girls – to do the laundry
Girls – and in the bathroom
Girls – that's all I really want is girls
Two at a time – I want girls
With new-wave hairdos – I want girls
I ought to whip out my – girls, girls, girls, girls, girls....!12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh, what'ch'you...what are you sayin?

All you Trekkies and TV addicts
Don't mean to diss, don't mean to bring static
All you Klingons in the fucking house
Grab your backstreet friend and get loud
Blowin' doors off hinges
I'll grab you with the pinchers
And no, I didn't retire
I'll snatch you up with a needle nose pliers

Like Mutual of Omaha
Got the ill boat you've never seen before
Glidin' in the glades
And like Lorne Greene, you know I get paid
Like caprese and with the basil
Not goofy like Darren or Hazel
I'm a motherfuckin' Nick at Night
With classics rerunning that you know all right

Now remain calm, no alarm
'Cause my farm ain't fat
So what's up with that?
I've got friends and family that I respect
When I think I'm too good, they put me in check
So believe when I say I'm no better than you
Except when I rap, so I guess it ain't true
Like that, y'all, and you just don't stop
Guaranteed to make your body rock
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this muthafucking party out

I said, "Doc, what's the condition?
I'm a man that's on a mission"
He said, "Son, you'd better listen
Stuck in your ass is an electrician"
Like a scientist
Mmm, when I'm applying this
Method of controlling my mind
Like Einstein and the Rapping Duke combined

Now, hey, baby bubba, now what's the deal?
I didn't know you go for that mass appeal
Some call it salugi, some hot potato
I stole your mic, but you won't see it later
'Cause I work magic like a magician
I add up, the mathematician
I'm a bank cashier, engineer
I wear cotton and I don't wear sheer
Shazam and abracadabra
In the whip, I'm gonna cruise past ya
Yo, money, don't chump yourself
Put that shit back on the shelf
Light rays blazing, you're out of phase, and my crew's amazing
We're working on the record, yo, so just stay patient

Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfucking party out

Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out

Now, I go by the name of the King Ad-Rock
I don't wear a cup nor a jock
I bring the shit that's beyond bizarre
Like Miss Piggy (Who, moi?)
I am the one with the clientele
You say, "Ad-Rock, you rock so well"
I've got class like pink champale
MCA, grab the mic before the mic goes stale
Don't test me, they can't arrest me
I'll fake right, cross-over and shoot lefty
You look upset, yo, calm down
You look like Cable Guy dunked off of your crown
I flow like smoke out a chimney
You never been me
You wanna rap but what you're making ain't hip-hop, B

Now-
Get your clothes right out the dryer
Put Armor All up on your tire
Sport that fresssssh attire
Tonight we goin' out, set the town on fire
Set the town ablaze
Gonna stun and amaze
Ready to throw a craze
Make your granny shake her head and say "those were the days"

Now check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out

(Aah) Ooh (Oh) ee (Ah) ah (Eh) ooh (Eh, eh)


One-two, one-two, keep it on
Listen to the shit because we keep it 'til dawn
Listen to the Abstract, got it going on
Listen to the ladies, come on and let me spawn
On your eggs, then you go up the river
Listen to the Abstract, that freaky nigga

Now I'm Ad Rock and I shock and I tick and I tock
And I can't stop with the body rock

See, I've got heart like John Starks
Hitting mad sparks
Pass me the mic and I'll be rockin' the whole park

Well, I'm the M to the C to the A and it's a must
The rhymes that we bust on the topic of lust
And my Moms is not butt, but fuck it
Let me get down to the rhythm
Yes, I get funky and I'm shooting all my jism
Like John Holmes, the X-rated nigga
Listen to the shit cause I am the ill figure
Nobody's getting any bigger than this

Get it together
Get-get it together
Get...
Phone is ringing, oh my God
Get it together, see what's happening


Ad Rock's down with the Ione
Listen to the shit cause both of them is bony
Gotta do it like this, like Chachi and Joanie

'Cause she's the cheese and I'm the macaroni
So why all the fight and why all the fuss?
'Cause ha, I ain't got no dust
Yeah, you know I'm getting silly
Got a Grandma Hazel and a Grandma Tilly
Well, I'm the Grand Royal prez and I'm also a member
Born on the cusp in the month of November
I do the Patty Duke, in case you don't remember
Well, I freak a funky beat like the shit was in a blender

Well, I'm long gone, word is bond
Don't need a motherfuckin' fool to tell me right from wrong
I don't think I'm slick nor do I play like I'm hard
But I'ma drive the lane like I was Evan Bernard

And I be working on my game

Because life is taxing

Gotta get it together

And see what's happening

Get it together
Wait a minute, wait a minute (Get)
Wait a minute, (Get it) wait a minute
Get it together
Wait a minute, (Get) wait a minute (Get-get)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Get it together
Wait a minute, wait a minute
S-see what's happening

I go One-Two like my name was Biz Mark
But I had to do the shit, just let me embark
On the lyric and the noun and the verb
Let me kick the shit off cause, yo, I'm not the herb

Well, it's not the herb but the spice with the flavor to spare
The Moog with the funk for your derriere
While we're on that topic, yes, I like to mention
When it comes to bonin' - woo! - I'm representing

Spacin', zonin', talkin' on the phone and
My brain is roamin' and I don't know where it's goin'
Talking lots of shit, a little tweaking on the weekend (what?)
I gotta to get him by the reins because I know that I'm freaking (yeah)

Well, I'm a funky soul and I'm a Scorpio
And when I get my flow I'm Dr. On-the-Go
So, Q-Tip, what you on the mic for?

Because I had to talk about the times when I rhyme
And when the MC's come in my face, I'm like mace
Because I back them off with the quills
'Cause I have to tell you, nigga, 'cause I'll keep you under prills
Resting on Nine-One-One Sixteenth Ave., off the Farmers Boulevard (yeah)
Well I'm from Manhattan, MCA's from Brooklyn
Yeah, MCA, your shit be cookin'

(Yeah)
Praying mantis on the court and I can't be beat
But, yo, Tip, what's up with the boots on your feet?

Got the Timbos on the toes and this is how it goes
Oh, one-two, oh my god
One-two, oh my god

I got some shit
I've got the kung fu grip behind my green trap kit
Never, ever, ever smoking crack

Never, ever, ever fucking wack
I eat the fuckin' pineapple Now & Laters
Listen to me now, don't listen to me later
Fuck it, 'cause I know I didn't make it fuckin' rhyme for real
But, yo, technically I'm as hard as steel

Gonna get it together, watch it
Gonna get it together, Ma Bell
I'm like Ma Bell, I got the ill communication
Ma Bell, Got the ill communication
Ma Bell, Got the ill communications (Who's that?)
Ma Bell, Got the ill communication (word 'em up, word-word 'em up)
Ma Bell

Now, I rock a house party at the drop of a hat (yeah)
Now, I beat a biter down with an aluminum bat
A lot of people they be Jonesin' just to hear me rock the mic
They be staring at the radio, staying up all night
So like a pimp, I'm pimpin', I got a boat to eat shrimp in
Nothing wrong with my leg, I'm just B-boy limpin'
Got arrested at the Mardi Gras for jumping on a float
My man MCA's got a beard like a billy goat
"Ooh-ooh" is my disco call
MCA (hu-huh), I'm gettin' rope, y'all
Routines I bust, and the rhymes that I write
And I'll be busting routines and rhymes all night
Like eating burgers or chicken and you'll be picking ya nose, man
I'm on time, homie, that's how it goes
You heard my style, I think you missed the point
It's the joint!

Mike D (Yeah?) With your bad self running things
(What's up?) With your bad breath onion rings
Well, I'm Mike D, and I'm back from the dead
Chillin' at the beach, down at Club Med
Make another record 'cause the people, they want more of this
Suckers, they be saying they can take out Adam Horovitz
Hurricane, you got clout
Other DJ's, he'll put your head out
A puppet on a string, I'm paid to sing or rhyme
Or do my thing, I'm in a lava lamp, inside my brain hotel
I might be freakin or peakin', but I rock well
The Patty Duke Show, the Wrench, and then I bust the Tango
Got more rhymes than Jamaica got mango
I got the peg leg at the end of my stump-a
Shake your rump-a
A full clout, y'all, a full clout, y'all
And when the mic is in my mouth, I turn it out, y'all
A full clout​
Never been dumped, 'cause I'm the most mackinest
Never been jumped, 'cause I'm known the most packinest
Yeah, we've got beef, chief, we're knocking out teeth, chief
And if you don't believe us, you should question your belief, Keith
Like Sam the butcher bringing Alice the meat
Like Fred Flintstone, driving around with bald feet
Should I have another sip? Nah, skip it
In the back of the ride and bust with the whippet
Rope-a-dope dookies all around the neck
Woo-ha! Got them all in check
Running from the law, the press, and the parents
Is your name Michael Diamond? No, mine's Clarence
From downtown, Manhattan, the Village
My style is wild, and you know that it still is
Disco bag schlepping, and you're doing the bump
Shake your rump-a5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Now here we go dropping science, dropping it all over
Like bumping around the town like when you're driving a Range Rover
Expanding the horizon and expanding the parameters
Expanding the rhymes of sucka MC amateurs
Naugles, Isaac Newton, a scientific EZ
Ben Franklin with the kite, gettin’ ova with the key
Now rock, shocker the mike of the many times, times the times tables
Rock well to tell, dispel, all of the old fables
Cuz I be dropping the new science and I be kicking the new k-nowledge
An emcee to a degree that you can't get in college
Now the dregs of the Earth and the eggs that I eat
I've got pegs through my hands and one through my feet
Shea Stadium, the radium, E.M.D. squared
Kicked out of the Palladium, 'dja think that I cared?
It's the sounds of science, the sounds of science
Science

Rope-a-Dope!
The newest in new, "Right up to your face and diss you"
Waxin' and milkin'
All of y'all square heads

Time and money for girls covered with honey
You lie and aspire to be as cunning
Reelin' and rockin' and rollin' B-sized D-cup
Order the Quarter Deluxe, why don'tcha wake up?
My mind is kinda flowing like an oil projector
Had to get up and get the Jimmy protector
Went berserk and worked, and exploded
She woke up in the morning, and her face was coated
Buddy, you study the man on the mic
D, do whatcha like (Huh)
Drunk as a skunk am I from celebration
To peep that freak unique penetration
Well, I figured out who makes the crack, it's
The suckas with the badges and the blue jackets
Professor of science cuz I keep droppin' it
I smell weak cuz y'all keep poppin' it
People always ask me what's the phenomenon
Yo, what's up? Yo, what's goin' on?
No one really knows what I'm talkin' about
And yeah, that's right, my name's Yauch...

Ponce De Leon, constantly on
The fountain of youth, not Robotron
Peace is a word I've heard before
So move and move and move up on the dance floor
Cuz I'm gonna die, gonna die one day
Cuz I'm goin' and goin' and goin' this way
Not like a roach or a piece of toast
I'm goin' out first class, ain't goin' out coach
Rock my Adidas, never rock Filas
I do not sniff the coke, I only smoke the sinsemilla
Well, with my nose I knows, and with my scope I scopes
What I live I write, and that's strictly rope
I got science for any occasion
Postulating theorems, formulating equations
Well, Cheech Wizard in a snow blizzard
Eat a chicken gizzard with a girl named Lizzy

Dropping science like Galileo dropped the orange3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Because mutiny on the Bounty's what we're all about
I'm gonna board your ship and turn it on out
No soft sucker with a parrot on his shoulder
'Cause I'm bad gettin' bolder - cold getting colder
Terrorizing suckers on the seven seas
And if you've got beef - you'll get capped in the knees
We got sixteen men on a dead man's chest
And I shot those suckers, and I'll shoot the rest
Most illingest b-boy - I got that feeling
'Cause I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'
Shhh-Snatching gold chains, nicking pieces of eight
I got your money and your honey and the fly name plate
We got wenches on the benches - and bitties with titties
Housing all girlies from city to city
One for all and all for one
Taking out emcees with a big shotgun
All for one and one for all
Because the Beastie Boys have gone AWOL
Friggin' in the riggin' and cuttin' your throat
Big biting suckers gettin' thrown in the moat
We got maidens and wenches - man, they're on the ace
Ah, Captain Bligh is gonna die when we break his face
Most illingest b-boy, well, I got that feeling
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'

Torching and crackin' and rhymin' and stealin'
Robbin' and raping - busting two in the ceiling
I'm wheelin', I'm dealin' - I'm drinking, not thinking
Never cower, never shower - and I'm always stinking
Yo-ho-ho and a pint of Brass Monkey
And when my girlie shakes her hips, she sure gets funky
Skirt-chasin', free-basin' - killin' every village
We drink and rob and rhyme and pillage
Most illingest b-boy, well, I got that feeling
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'
I was…
I've been drinking my rum - a def son of a gun
*I fought the law*, and I cold won
Blackbeard's weak - Moby Dick's on the chicks
'Cause I pull out the jammy, and I squeeze off six
My pistol is loaded - I shot Betty Crocker
Deliver Colonel Sanders down to Davey Jones' locker
Rhymin' and stealin' in a drunken state
And I'll be rockin' my rhymes all the way to Hell's gate

Ahh, yeah

I looked out the window, seen his bald head
Ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg
Scoped him with my scopes, he had no hair
Launched that shot, and he was caught out there
Saw the convertible driving by
I loaded up the slingshot, let one fly
He went for his to find he didn't have one
Put him in check, correct, with my egg-gun
The egg, a symbol of life
I go inside your house and bust out your wife
I pulled out the jammy, he thought it was a joke
The trigger, I pulled - his face, the yolk
Reached in his pocket, took all his cash
Left my man standing with the egg mustache
Suckers, they come a dime a dozen
"When I say dozen, you know what I'm talkin' about, boy"

Yeah, that's right, I'm the Egg Man
Driving around, king of the town (yeah)
Always got my windows rolled down
Ready to throw
You know, I'm the Egg Man
Once upon a time (Egg Man…)
Humpty Dumpty was a big fat egg
He was playing the wall, then he broke his leg
Tossed it out the window, three minutes hot
Hit the Rastaman, he said, (Bloodclot!)
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
I egged the chicken, and then I ate his leg
Riding the trains, in between cars
When I pull out the station, You're Gonna Get Yours
Drive-by eggings, plaguing LA
"Yo, you just got my little cousin, ese!"
Sometimes hard-boiled, sometimes runny (Ray)
Comes from a chicken, not a bunny, dummy
People laugh, it's no joke
My name's "Yauch" and I'm throwing the yolk
Now they got me in a cell, but I don't care
It was then that I got caught catching people out there

Up on the roof, in my car, up all night
I'm going through science like Dolemite
The Mack (Who?)
I'm the Egg Man… Taxi driver?
I'm the Egg Man
Egg Man, Egg Man
We all dressed in black, we snuck up around the back
We began to attack, the eggs did crack on Haze's back
Sam I Am, down with the program
Green Eggs and Ham, Yosemite Sam
Come Halloween, you know I come strapped
I throw it at a sucker… "k-pap"
You made the mistake and judge a man by his race
You go through life with egg on your face
Woke up in the morning, peculiar feeling
Looked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling
The family, punk rocks, the businessman
I'll dog everybody with the egg in my hand
It's not like the crack that you put in a pipe
But crack on your forehead; here's a towel, now wipe

Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man
Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man
Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man...
Egg Man...6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm Ad-Rock, I'm lit like a motherfuck
Well, I'm brewing up rhymes like I was using a still
Kickin' it old school flow like Mike McGill

Got fat bass lines like Russell Simmons steals money
Got clientele, you know I rock well
And then you're on my dick because I'm DFL
Yeah, Mike, 'cause playing the bass is my favorite shit
I might be a hack on the stand up but I'm working at it
I got my hair cut correct like Anthony Mason
Then I ride the IRT right up to Penn Station (Yeah, huh)
Penn Station, up on 8th Ave
Listen all y'all, you get the ball back
He's got the Savior Faire because he's debonair
Well, Mike D with the vinyl, with the grooves so rare

B-Boys makin' with the freak freak

Been makin' with the freak freak, so unique
I been learning from the elders, now it's time to speak
Oh, that shit sounds nice
Mike D, come on and get it on, y'all
Talking shit about a mile a minute
Put the wax on the table and let the DJ spin it
Well, excuse me, motherfuckers, can I beg your pardon?
I'm gonna see the Knicks at the Madison Square Garden
And like the Knicks, I got game like I worked at Hasbro
On the mic I bug, like I was Prince Jazzbo
Well, the rhymes are stupid to make you go cuckoo
You can't sleep cause you're little Cindy Lou Who
Down with the Hurra since the Raising Hell Tour
Just listen to his cuts, there's no reason to tell more
Cindy what? I didn't catch the last one
That shit sounded kinda nice, but bust a fast one
Well, I'm not known for my speed raps
So grab the microphone and cut out the claps
Ah, yeah, I like that, shit is kind of rough
I'll grab the microphone and fuck it up
(Aight, woo!)
Well, I might seem out there, just a little deranged
I've got to cool off, catch me on the driving range
Well I'm the ladies' choice like I was JJ Evans
Legalize the weed and I'll say, Thank heavens!
I'm talking PGA Pro Tour 2
I'm Doctor Beepers on the tv, in my golfing shoes
Pass me an iron and I'll bust a chip shot
Then you throw me off the green because I'm strictly hip-hop
I'll grab the tee, I'll tee off
I'll grab the golf clubs and I'm off, I'm Audi, so check me
I've got the timbos on my toes when I'm not on the green
I've got the custom made boots with the spikey things
I'm working on my driving cause I'm going pro
I've got the funky fly golf gear from head to toe
Yeah, the B-Boys makin' with the freak freak 'cause it's unique unique
Mario's calling Nonni's about the pesto pizza
And then he's on a mission and he's checking for peacha

Yo, Leroy!
Ahh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Why don't you hook up that def jam right about now?
Now I chill real ill when I start to chill
When I fill my pockets with a knot of dollar bills
Sipping pints of ale out the window sill
When I get my fill, I'm chilly-chill
Now, I just got home because I'm out on bail
What's the time? It's time to buy ale
Peter eater, parking meter, all of the time
If I run out of ale, it's Thunderbird wine
Miller-drinking, chicken-eating, dress so fly
I got friends in high places that are keeping me high
Get down with Mike D, and it ain't no hassle
I got the ladies of the eighties from here to White Castle...
Hold it now, hit it
Yo, Leroy!
It's my drum, it's my, hold it now, it's my rhyme
And now it's me, Adam Yauch, in the place to be
All the girls are on me 'cause I'm down with Mike D
I'm down with Mike D, and it ain't no baloney
For real, not phony, O.E. and Rice-a-Roni
I come out at night 'cause I sleep all day
Well, I'm the King Ad-Rock, and he's MCA
Well, I'm cruisin', I'm bruisin', I'm never ever losing
I'm in my car, I'm going far, and dust is what I'm using
Around the way is where I'm from
And I'm from Manhattan, and I'm not a bum
Because you're pud-slapping, ball-flapping, got that juice
My name's Mike D, and I can do that Jerry Lewis
Hold it now, hit it
Yo, Leroy!
Yo, that was real def, man, try that again, man
I like that def stuff, boy
Hip-hoppin', body rockin', doin' the do
Beer drinking, breath stinking, sniffing glue
Belly fillin', always illin', bustin' caps
My name's Mike D, and I write my own snaps
I'm a-peep-show seeking on the Forty-Deuce
I'm a killer at large, and I'm on the loose
Pistol packing, Monkey drinking, no money bum
I come from Brooklyn 'cause that's where I'm from
Cheap-skatin', perpetrating, money-hungry jerk
Every day I drink O.E., and I don't go to work
You drippy-nose knucklehead, you're wet behind the ears
You like men, and we like beer
Hold it now, hit it
Yo, Leroy!
Bust that choco-lotto
What, huh, yo, man, pass that over here, man, all right
King of the Ave with the Def female
You're rhymin' and stealin' with the freshest ale
Kid cooling at the crib watching my TV
Ed Norton - Ted Knight - and Mr. E-D
Pump it up, homeboy, just don't stop
Chef Boyardee, cooling on the pot
I take no slack, 'cause I got the knack
I'm never dusting out 'cause I tossed that crack
The King Ad-Rock — that is my name
Y'all drinking Moet, and we got the champagne

(Hey) Hey ladies in the place, I'm callin' out to ya
There never was a city kid truer and bluer
There's more to me than you'll ever know
And I got more hits than Sadaharu Oh
Tom Thumb, Tom Cushman, or Tom Foolery
Date women on TV with the help of Chuck Woolery
Words flowin' out just like the Grand Canyon
And I'm always out lookin' for a female companion
I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib
I took off her moccasins and put on the bib
Wheelin' and dealin', I make a little bit of a stealin'
I'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peelin'
Your body's on time and your mind is appealin'
Starin' at the cracks up there up on the ceilin'
Such and such will be the bass that I'm throwin'
I'm talking to a girl, telling her I'm all-knowing
Well, she's talking to the kid ("Who?" to the kid)
I'm telling her every lie that you know that I never did

Hey ladies, get funky
All the ladies in the house
The ladies, the ladies

Well, me in the corner with a good-lookin' daughter
I dropped my drawers and said, "Welcome back Kotter"
We was cuttin' up the rug, she started cuttin' up the carpet
In my apartment, I begged her please stop it
The gift of gab is the gift that I have
And that girl ain't nothin' but a crab
Educated: no, stupid: yep
And when I say stupid, I mean stupid fresh
I'm not James At 15 or Chachi in charge
I'm Adam, and I'm adamant about livin' large
With the white Sassoons and the looks that kill
Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville
I met a little cutie, she was all hopped up on zootie
I liked the little cutie, but I kicked her in the booty
Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around
You be listenin' to my records', a number one sound
Step, step to the rhythm, step, step to the rhyme
I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside
Tune in, turn on, to my tune that's live
Ladies flock like bees to a hive
Hey ladies, get funky
Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies
Girls, girls
Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies
One more time, ain't it funky now
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies
Ain't it funky now (You know that)

She's got a gold tooth, you know she's hardcore
She'll show you a good time, then she'll show you the door
Break up with your girl, it ended in tears
Vincent van Gogh, go and mail that ear
I call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinkin'
The phone booth on the corner is damp, and it's stinkin'
She said come on over, it was me that she missed
I threw that trash can through her window 'cause you know I got dissed
Your old lady left you, and you went insane
You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 Train
Well, take my advice at any price
A gorilla like your mother is mighty weak, man
Suckin' down pints 'til I didn't know
Woke up in the morning with the Won Ton Ho
'Cause I announce, I like girls that bounce
With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce
Girls with curls, and big long locks
And beatnik chicks, just wearing their smocks
Walkin' high and mighty like she's number one
She thinks she's the passionate one
Hey ladies, get funky
What's that?
Good god
Good god, dance
Good god
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Ain't it funky, brother?
He, ha, ha, ha

Riddle me this, my brother, can you handle it?
Your style to my style, you can't hold a candle to it
Equinox symmetry and the balance is right
Smokin' and drinkin' on a Tuesday night
It's not how you play the game, it's how you win it
I cheat and steal and sin, and I'm a cynic
For those about to rock, we salute you
The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to
I once was lost, but now I'm found
The music washes over, and you're one with the sound
Well, who shall inherit the earth? The meek shall
And, yo, I think I'm starting to peak now, Al
And then the man upstairs, well, I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts, I'd be a millionaire
We're just three emcees, and we're on the go

Only twelve notes, well, a man can play
Music for all, but not just one people
And now we're gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel
More Adidas sneakers than a plumber's got pliers
Got more suits than Jacoby & Meyers (Wow)
If not for my vices, and my bugged-out desires
My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires
'Cause I'm out picking pockets at the Atlantic Antic
And nobody wants to hear you because your rhymes are damn frantic
I mix business and pleasure way too much
You know, wine and women and song and such
I don't get blue, I got a mean red streak
You don't pay the band, your friends, yo, that's weak
Get even like Steven (Even) like pulling a Rambo
Well, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego! (You know)

Steal from the rich, and I'm out robbing banks

Because I've got more stories than J.D.'s got Salinger
I hold the title, and you are the challenger
I've got money like Charles Dickens
I've got the girlies in the Coupe like the Colonel's got the chickens
And I'm always going out dapper like Harry S. Truman
I'm madder than Mad's Alfred E. Newman

(Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego)
(Shad-)
(Oh, never gonna let 'em say that I don't love you)
(Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego)
(Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego)

Well, my noggin is hoggin' all kinds of thoughts
And Adam Yoggin is Yauch, and he's rockin' of course, wow
Smoke the holy chalice, got my own religion
Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians
Like Jerry Lee Swaggart or Jerry Lee Falwell
You love Mario Andretti cause he always drives his car well
Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born
And we love the hot butter (Say what?) The popcorn
Sippin' on wine and mackin'
Rockin' on the stage with all the hands clappin' (Yeah)
Ride the wave of fate, it don't ride me, Homes
(Being very proud to be an emcee)
And then the man upstairs, well, I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts, I'd be a millionaire
Amps and crossovers under my rear hood
Because the bass is bumping from the back of my Fleetwood
They tell us what to do? Hell no!
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego!
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego (-no)
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego
