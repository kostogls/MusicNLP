Mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me mirror, what is wrong?
Can it be my De La Clothes
Or is it just my De La Soul?
What I do ain't make-believe
People say I sit and try
But when it comes to being De La
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Now you tease my Plug One style
And my Plug One spectacles
You say Plug One and Two are hippies
No we're not, thats pure plug bull
Always pushing that we formed an image
There's no need to lie
When it comes to being Plug One
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
Proud, I'm proud of what I am
Poems I speak are Plug Two type
Please oh please let Plug Two be
Himself, not what you read or write
Write is wrong when hype is written
On the Soul, De La that is
Style is surely our own thing
Not the false disguise of show-biz
De La Soul is from the soul
And in fact I can't deny
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie
And from me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Glory Glory Hallelu
Glory for Plug One and Two
But that glory's been denied
By condescending dookie eyes
People think they diss my person
By stating I'm darkly packed
I know this so I point at Q-Tip
And he states, "Black is Black"
Mirror mirror on the wall
Shovel chestnuts in my path
Just keep all nuts twistin up
So I don't get an aftermath
But if I do I'll calmly punch them
In the 4th day of July
Cause they tried to mess with third degree
That's me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Vibe, vibrations
Stakes is high, you know them stakes is high
When we talkin' 'bout the vibe, vibrations
Stakes is high, you know them stakes is high
We talkin' 'bout vibe, vibrations
Stakes is high, you know them stakes is high

The instamatic focal point bringin' damage to your borough
Be some brothers from the East with them beats that be thorough
Got the solar gravitation, so I'm bound to pull it
I gets down like brothers are found duckin' from bullets
Gun control means usin' both hands in my land
Where it's all about the cautious livin'
Migratin' to a higher form of consequence
Compliments of strugglin' that shouldn't be notable
Man, every word I say should be a Hip-Hop Quotable

I'm sick of bitches shakin' asses
I'm sick of talkin' 'bout blunts, sick of Versace glasses
Sick of slang, sick of half-ass awards shows
Sick of name-brand clothes
Sick of R&B bitches over bullshit tracks
Cocaine and crack, which brings sickness to blacks
Sick of swoll' head rappers with their sickenin' raps
Clappers of gats, makin' the whole sick world collapse
The facts are gettin' sicker, even sicker perhaps
I Stickabush to make a bundle to escape this synapse
Man, life can get all up in your ass
Baby, you betta work it out
Let me tell you what it's all about:
A skin not considered equal
A meteor has more right than my people
Who be wastin' time screamin' who they've hated
That's why the Native Tongues has officially been reinstated

(Vibes... vibrations)
Yeah
Stakes is high
(Higher than high)
You know them stakes is high
(Higher than high)
When we talkin' 'bout...
(Vibes... vibrations)
Stakes is high
Man, them stakes is high
(Aiyo, what about that love?)

Yo, it's about love of cars, love of funds
Lovin' to love mad sex, lovin' to love guns
Love for opposite, love for fame and wealth
Love for the fact of no longer lovin' yourself, kid
We livin' in them days of the man-made craze
Where every aspect is vivid
These brothers no longer talk shit, aiyo, these niggas live it
'Bout to give it to you 24/7 on the microphone
Plug One translatin' the zone
No offense to a player but, yo, I don't play
Nigga, take offense? Fuck it, gotta be that way
Jay Dee, Dove, show your love, what you got to say?
I say G's are makin' figures at a high regard
And niggas dyin' for it nowadays ain't odd
Investin' in fantasies and not God
Welcome to reality, see, times is hard
People try to snatch the credit, but can't claim the card
Showin' out in videos, sayin' they co-starred
See, shit like that'll make your mama cry
Better watch the way you spend it 'cause the stakes is high

Y'all know them stakes is high
When you're dealin' with the...
(Vibes... vibrations)
Stakes is high
(Come on)
Man, them stakes is high
(Check it)

I think that smilin' in public is against the law (What?!)
'Cause love don't get you through life no more
It's who you know, and "How you, son?"
And how you gettin' in, and who the man holdin' heat, yo
And how was the skins and how high
Yo, what up, huh? I heard you caught a body
Seem like every man and woman shared a life with John Gotti
But they ain't organized!
Mixin' crimes with life enzymes
Takin' the big scalp route and niggas, no doubt
Better than they know their daughters and their sons
(Oh, boy)
Yo, people go through pain and still don't gain
Positive contact just like my main man
Who got others cleanin' up his physical and fluids
His mind got congested, he got the nine and blew it
Neighborhoods are now hoods 'cause nobody's neighbors
Just animals survivin' with that animal behavior
Under I who be rhymin' from dark to light sky
Experiments where needles and skin connect
No wonder where we live is called the projects
When them stakes is high
You damn sure try to do anythin' to get the piece of the pie
Electrify, even die for the cash
But at last, you be out even though you wantin' more
This issue is closed like an elevator door
But soon re-opened once we get to the next floor where the...

Up in them 5-star tellies saying two mic rhymes
Be them average MC's of the times
Unlike them, we craft gems
So systematically inclined to pen lines
Without saying the producer's name all over the track
Yeah I said it! What you need to do is get back
To reading credits, we them medics
Alphabetically stuck on that A grade shit
Now quit now before we pour
That sure shot pure rock cocaine flow

From the top of the key for 3 -- Villain!
Been on in the game as long as he can wheelie a Schwinn
Turn the corner spinning, bust that ass and get up
Dust off the mask, whoever laugh give him a head up
He got jumped, it pumped his adrenaline
He said it made him tougher than a bump of raw medicine
To write all night long, the hourglass is still slow
Flow from Hellborn to free power like LILCo
And still owe bills, pay dues forever
Slay youths when it comes to who's more cleverer
Use to wore a leather goose V with a fur collar
And charged a fee for loose leaf words per dollar
Ya heard? Holler - broad or dude, we need food
Eat your teams for sure, the streets sure seem rude
For fam like the Partridges, pardon him for the mix-up
Battle for your Atari cartridges or put your kicks up
It's a stick up
Now put your blix up, these Riddick Bowe cuts
Is swoll like penile flicks, give 'em 20
The danger in his eyes'll let you know he's a brawler
Bring your tallest champs like that much taller
Ten pounds heavier, one step ahead of it
Vocab, stamina, style's all irrelevant
Camps and cliques, units, squad crews and clans
Even your tongues'll fuck around and leave your mouth

DOOM brung that bum, there goes that news van again
Act like you knew like Toucan Sam and 'em
He eat rappers like part of a complete breakfast
Their rhymes ain't worth the weight of they cheap necklace
String 'em up, ring 'em up under whack junk snack
And get that out your hand, punk, jump and get your dunk smacked
Foul, we all know the rules bro
You slow, you blow the soup on you fools, his own Boss like Hugo

You go lights, camera, action with no makeup
We De La to the death or at least until we break up
Here's a couple of nice guys who finished first
So nice try, but the prize is ours dispersed
They say the good die young, so I added some
Bad-ass to my flavor to prolong my life over the drum
Everyone cools off from being hot
It's about if you can handle being cold or not
And we was told to hop on no one's dick by Prince Paul
We stayed original ever since y'all
First to do a lot of things in the game but the last to say it
No need to place it on a scale to weigh it
And don't do it for the praise or to raise the bar
Yet it's raised anyway, it's so amazing, are
The three L.I. brothers from the other way of thinking
Hey your lady's winking, I think you need to control that
Or I'll have to hold that
The elements are airborne, I smell the success
(Yo let's cookie cut the shit and get the gingerbread, man)
Sacrifice mics and push drugs to these rappers
Puff ponies 'til I turn blue in the lips
Sipping broads like 7-Up (ahh) so refreshing
I finger pop these verses like first dates
The birthdate's September 2-1, 1-9, 6-8
Too old to rhyme, too bad, too late25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Three, that’s the Magic Number
Yes, it is, it’s the magic number
Somewhere in this hip-hop soul community
Was born three: Mase, Dove and me
And that’s the magic number
(What does it all mean?)

Difficult preaching is Posdnuos’ pleasure
Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart
Something that stimulates the music in my measure
Measure in my music, raised in three parts
Casually see but don’t do like the Soul
Cause seein’ and doin’ are actions for monkeys
Doin’ hip hop hustle, no rock and roll
Unless your name’s Brewster, cause Brewster's a Punk (three)
Parents let go cause there’s magic in the air
Criticising rap shows you're out of order
Stop look and listen to the phrase Fred Astaires
And don’t get offended while Mase do-si-do’s your daughter
A tri-camera rolls since our music’s now set
Fly rhymes are stored on a Da.I.S.Y. production
It stands for “Da Inner Sound, Y’all” and y’all can bet
That the action's not a trick, but sho nuff a function
Everybody wants to be a deejay
Everybody wants to be an emcee
But being speakers are the best
And you don’t have to guess
De La Soul posse consists of three
And that’s the magic number

This here piece of the pie
Is not dessert, but the course that we dine
And three out of every darn time
The effect is “Mmmm” when a daisy grows in your mind
Showing true position, this here piece is
Kissin’ the part of the pie that's missin’
When that negative number fills up the cavity
Maybe you can subtract it
You can call it your lucky partner
Maybe you can call it your adjective
But odd as it may be
Without my 1 and 2 where would there be
My three: Mase, Pos and me
And that’s the Magic Number
Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul
Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds
Common are speakers who honor the scroll
Scrolls written daily creates a new sound
Listeners listen cause this here is wisdom
Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug
Set aside a legal substance to feed ‘em
For now get 'em high off this dialect drug
Time is a factor so it's time that counts
Count not the negative actions of one
Speakers of soul say it's time to shout
Three forms the soul to a positive sum
Dance to this fix and flex every muscle
Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber
Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle
Shake, rattle, roll to my Magic Number
Now you may try to subtract it
But it just won't go away
Three times one?
(What is it?)
(One, two, three!)
And that's a Magic Number
(Yo, what's up?)
(1, 2, 3)
(I say, children, what does it all mean?)
(Woah-woah-wo, 1, 2, 3)
(I wouldn't lie to you)
(No more no less, that's a magic number)
(No more no less)
(What it is?)
(No more no less)
(Do the shang-a-lang)
(No more no less)
(Anybody in the audience ever get hit by a car?)
(No more no less)
(How high's the water, mama?)
(No more no less)
(How high's the water, mama?)
(No more no less)
(Three feet high and rising)
(No more no less)
(Three)
(That's a magic number)5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Greetings girl and welcome to my world of phrase
I'm right up to bat
It's a Daisy Age and you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat
Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your
Involvements before the sun
But clear your court cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One
Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me
Eye Know this
But not because of all my Earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

Eye know Eye love you better

May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
The name's Plug Two
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
It's true
Eye know Eye love you better

Now it's time to let this rhyme style
Get somewhat poured in the mold
Hold my hand and we'll pick my plantation
Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul
Life will begin at the cut of a rim
Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug One's within
Forward march is the say
When transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing
And in full swing
I show this in gifts, words or letters
But even without those three
Eye know you'll be close to me cause

Eye know Eye love you better
It's I again and the soul that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend 'till we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten
Then we will meet Mr Stuckie
And Pos' brother Lucky will preach
Let the wedding begin
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a G-clef
My dear, I claim you're def
And if you can hear me, by golly gee
Trugoy is ready for what you possess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two
Picture perfect things and I sing of how

Eye know Eye love you better6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Pain will make it better
Tell me how you feel
Look over your shoulder
Time will make it real
Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better

Let me see how many palms go up high
If you've ever felt the world had you licked (Put 'em up high)
And what you waving side to side to symbolize
Needing help on the sand put you under quick
Big mama said, "The Devil's up to no good"
But we can heal it on a Sunday with a good book (What?)
Or we can kill it on a Monday for a good look (And)
Make it part of the campaign, to withstand pain
Me, myself, place it all on my shoulders
And give it my all, like heavy lifting
No gain without tears and sweat
They claim blue skies with white clouds, steady drifting
When pain come to get ya, it hit ya like flu
Better times will pick ya, do what you gotta do
To earn focus in the stormy weather
Come out the tunnel to the light, saying
Pain will make it better
Tell me how you feel
Look over your shoulder
Time will make it real
Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
(I hear the people saying)
Pain will make it better
(I hear my people saying)
Pain will make it better

No wetter, four-letter, mo' better
Slow pain, no gain, go-getter
Change like the weather
Solid as a rock, small piece of leather but well put together
Flames are endeavors
Time to find out that gain makes it better
Pain makes it better
Shades of epiphany, can't let it get to me
Move so differently, do it so swiftly
Ease into my style, lay mine down
King be crowned, look at me now
Teaching my classes by the masses
Used to gang-bang, used to love the clashes
Now cash is the only motivation
But not for me, G, I’m into public relations
That's food for your De La Soul, word to the letter
Pain will make it better
Tell me how you feel
Look over your shoulder
Time will make it real
Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
(I heard my nana say it, say it, yo)

The bigger the headache, bigger the pill
The harder you fall, stronger the will
We came from the back of the bus, talking Watts to Mobile
Now we're on a house on a hill
Struggle went from filling ya gas tank
The bank wasn't feeling your loan
The OT couldn't cover the bills
When life came with a couple of spills
But we're gon' use that pain for fuel, so

Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
(I hear the people say)
Pain will make it better
(You hear my people saying)
Pain will make it better
(I hear the people say)
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better

"Yes, this is Miss Renee King from Philadelphia. I want you to give me a call on area code 215-222-4209 and I'm calling in reference to the music business. Thank you."

Hey, how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you
Hey, how are ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

Once again it's another rap bandit
Fiending at I and I can't stand it
Wanna be down with the Day-Glo
Knocking on my door, saying, "a yo yo"
Knocking on my door, saying, "a yo yo"
"I got a funky new tune with a fly banjo"
I can't understand what the problem is
I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz
How'd they get my name and number
Then I stop to think and wonder
Bout a plan, yo man I gotta step out town
You wanna call me up? Take my number down
It's 222-2222
I gotta answering machine that can talk to you
It goes
Hey, how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name and number
And I'll get back to you

Yo, check it, exit the old style, enters the new
But nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a few
Or should I say a flock 'cause around every block
There's Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm
Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves
And flaunt a nut that's doggy as in dope
But it's not the mood to hear
The tales of limousines and pails
Of money they'll make like a pro
I be like, "Yo black, just play me the tape"
But at the show the time to spare I just make
But the songs created in they shacks
Are so wick-wick-wack, situations like this
And now I hate they give me smiles Kool-Aid wide and ask
"was it def?"
And with the straightest face I be like, "hell yes."
I slip them the digits to Papa Prince Paul
So I don't go AWOL but yet I know when they call they get
Hey, how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you
Hey, how are ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

Party at the dug-out on Diction Ave
Haven't been to the jam in quite a while
Figure I'll catch up on the latest styles
'Stead piles and piles of demo tapes by the miles
All I wanna do is cut on the decks wild
But edition up here by the miles to the center
Reliever of duty, Plug One mosies in
And I be like, "Yo G, Pos does all the producing"

Now woe is me to the third degree
Mase pulls the funny so I make like a bunny, jettin'
But I'm getting used to this demo abuse
Getting raped and giving birth to a tape
Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker
Attached to my success, sent like a stalker
Make way to my radius playin' fly guy
Try to get on my back they force like Luke Sky
Me, Myself, and I go through this act daily
And rarely do I not
No matter how I dodge some jackal always nails me
No matter what the plot
And even out on tour they be like
"Yo, I got a tape to play you back at the hotel"
I be like, "oh swell"
Unveil the numeric code that dials my room
And tell them to call me at noon
But of course there's no answering machine in my room
But a pretty young adorer who I swung on tour
And if it rings while we're alone she'll answer the phone
And with the quickness she'll recite like a poem
"Hey, you done did the right thing, dialed up my ring ring
Now you're waiting on the beep
Say, I would love if you'd sing
The tune to Tru instead of fronting on the speak."
So no problemo, just play the demo and at the end it's break out time
Please oh please don't press rewind cause I'll just lay it down the line

Hey, how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And we'll get back to you

Hey, how ya doing
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And we'll get back to you.. peace
'Yo what's up man, this is Ronald Master down with the Fish Tank

Hello
Meany, meany, meany, meany (Say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany (Say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, mean
You gotta do that again, Dove
Meany, meany, meany, meany (Say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany (Say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, mean (Okay)

Hello it's the Soul
Troopin' in wit the Jungle patrol
And this one's about the KO's, the knockouts out there
Who's holdin' my buddy
Hold up (Wait a minute)

Now just wait
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the all the levels are straight out the jungle
(The Jungle, the Brothers, the Brothers)

De La Soul, from the soul
Black medallions, no gold
Hangin' out wit Pos, hangin' out wit Mase
Buddy buddy buddy all in my face
For the lap, Jimbrowski must wear a cap
Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I'll initiate the buddy with a slap

Now for the next
I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess
For my jimmy wants nothin' but the best (the best)
The best (ooh wee!)
Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch
(Stick em up, stick em up jimmy)
Nets won't be needed unless
(Jenny wanna get right to the flesh)
(Sweet little woman, sweet little woman)

I won't lie, I love B-U-D-D-Y (why)
'Cause I never let it walk on by
When it comes to me and Jenny I seem
(Very serious) like a Peek Frean
Buddy is the act that occurs on the lift
When Jenny and jimmy start shootin' the gift
Boy let me get shot I won't even riff
Buddy buddy, don't you know you make me go nutty
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy
Not too skinny and not too chubby
Soft like Silly Putty
Miss Crabtree, I hope that you're not mad at me
'Cause I told you that it was your buddy
That was making me ever so horny
Junglelistically horny

On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the (Q-Tip: Q to her Tip)
On the A side or sometimes the flip
(Never gonna flip this record)
Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree
And the Luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3
(Plug 3 gets all the buddy)

Behind my bush, my buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out
(Or let loose the juice)
My buddy helps me to
(De La my Soul)
Keepin' jimmy in total control
Without Jimmy I'd be on a roll
(La la la l-la la la la, la la la l-la la la la)

Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul, here's what we'll find
A whole lot of fun, lots of fun together
Just like kissin' cousins (yeah that's kinda clever)
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my buddy, I will boast
That we're like Ethel Mertz and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mine and I can be your buddy

The best buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' lets Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed
(Word)

Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)

And I watched and then I checked my Swatch
To see the time
The Soul had formed a buddy line
And that buddy was (mine all mine)

Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul
Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds
Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands
(Then Jenny start flockin' in every brand)
'Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware
Yo fellas, should we keep her aware?
(Mmm Hmm, yeah!)

(And rollerskates)
(And rollerskates)
(And rollerskates)

Girl meets boy on Thursday night
Boy was high, girl fly like kite
They hold hands until next day
Boy then lets go, hit his way
Boy rules butt, brags to his boys
Erection brings sad boy joy
Boy thinks of that big fat back
Big black fat love, big black fat
Girl calls boy to stand him up on Saturday
Saturday

Saturday, it's a Saturday
It's a Saturday, it's a Saturday
Saturday, it's a Saturday
Saturday, it's a Saturday

Back once more with the wallop in the score
Must I ride and rip, should I make you rock your hip
Reviver of a roller-boogie in a rink
And sure to make you think about the times
To scope fun instead of fights
(But diving from a piece of metal sure to take your life)
Yo, slip your butt to the fix of this mix
Toss that briefcase, it's time to let loose
Cause you've worked like heck to get the weekend check
So unfasten that noose around your neck
Connected like a vibe from the wheel to the foot
Come on everybody dig the funky output
Five days you work
One whole day to play
Come on everybody, wear your rollerskates today
It's Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday-ay
(Is the word, is the word, is the word)

Now as you pump your fist I reminisce
To a bounce, rock, skate, roll fest to impress
Hey, pretty diamond, do you like the way I'm dressed
Cool, keep the faith and be my mate
Cause all we need is feet
(And rollerskates)
But promote the hustle cause it keeps me thin
No need to talk, look who just walked in

(Is there a Dred on skates?)
Yes, man
(So kick the wham on this jam)
Oh Mr. Sprinkler, Mr. Sprinkler
Wet me for one, Mr. Sprinkler
I'm heatin' high-five in a daze, no split
With a yawn I trip to the dawn
Out comes the bodies following the one idea
It's clear, rattle to the roll
Hold back up the track, grab your rollerskates y'all
And let's zip on by
Zip-a-de-doo-dah, let's zip on by
Feed on a weed and we're feeling high
Sun is on thick and the cheese is rollin' quick
Come on, there's no time to hide
Season is twist, spinning and winning
No hackeysack, let let me in
Spill on the bottom away, but it's okay, hut
It's a Saturday
Pos: Now let's all get baked like Anita
Q-Tip: Watch Mr. Lawnge, don't look at the peter
Dove: Feel on the fun, I'll feel on the
Vinia: Hey, watch that!
De La Soul: It's a Saturday

Now is the time
To act the fool tonight
Forget about your worries and you will be all right
It's Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place
But you're not easy to love
I love the memory of...
I remember your face, I remember your way

I remember you now
Part of my existence
I remember your face
You came in and got me
All in a day
Yeah, all in a day
I remember your lips
Do you remember the taste?
Remember family names
Your child, my child, our child
Whitley and Dwayne
Different to my world now
Remember the ways
You gripped my hips so tight now?
Slow up the pace
Maybe erase, don't remember my waist

Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place
But you're not easy to love
I love the memory of...
I remember your face, I remember your way
How could I forget?
A ballad was born upon a demo of a fly love song
Didn't take long before the archer with the wings heard it
Shot us in the heart with a contract, he knew we were a hit
The right amount of soul with a parallel amount of grit
But the archer couldn't see the target of departure
Gave in your pink slip and called it quits
It's understood you would
Label me the mate who wronged you
Cause I kept wanting to feature
With them other females on they songs too
Your words spoken in mono for monogamy
Telling me I had to go cause I chose
Stereo for stereotypical male biology
And now I'm left setting traps
For you to fall in for me again
Who hates you to tell me
"Slow up the pace, maybe erase, don't…"

Slow up the pace
Maybe erase, don't remember my waist

Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place
But you're not easy to love
I love the memory of...
Our last trip to Vegas had me feeling like we had a chance
But chance just showed up at the wedding
I guess I didn't read the heading
"Forgivin' won't erase the bitter past"
But I ain't up for kissing ass
I bought you everything your pretty feet could fit in
Put you behind the finest steering wheels
Fearing you would drive a nigga crazy
Told you grow up, but shit, you was my baby
Bits and pieces never made nothing decent
When I accommodated you, you played me like a stranger

I remember you now (Accountability is major)
A part of what I did then
Remember your face
Just don't let me trip over memory lane
Cause time can't be replaced
And I don't want to stay

Cause, oh, it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's so dah-dah-dee-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dee-dah
It's so easy to fall
In dah-dah-dah-dah-dee-dah
Remember your way
Remember your way
It's De La featuring Estelle
With the Soul Brother Pete Rock4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
***
And and bass up the track a little bit
'Cause I'm — I wanna hear that woom sss-ch woom, knowhatI'msayin?
Yeah yeah, you know the bizness, Common Sense
Soul with the De La
Forget all them playas
We the rhyme-sayers
Huh, and that's the bizness, hah
Gon' do it like this
Gettin' it hot, like the Chicago streets

I speak divine of God theories, no need to be high
Always exhale the facts 'cause I don't inhale la/lie
Play the greater man's game to bounce off my losses
So I can earn the acres (Uhh), the houses (Yeah), the horses (Ha)
Of course it's much greater than your Benz or your Lex
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex
Much too complex, EFX/effects be live like Das
Makin' moves down South, to avoid the chaos
And never, flaunt the coin 'cause dime-getters be gazin'
They call me Luther Van', they say my style is So Amazing (Ha)
I'm fazin' those who're supposed to have the last laughter
'Cause even when I'm gone, I'm reappearin' in the after—
I have to send respects to real money makers
Do not connect us with those champagne-sippin' money fakers
Chase the quarter pound with spice from Chi-town
Now, what that prove? You're so full, you can't even move
'Cause I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E
And can't another brother cook these delicacies
Well, I'm the P-L-U, the G-to-the-One
Walk around the planet Earth, makin' money, havin' fun
Uh, and I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win
I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N
I sit and think with a drink...

Do you wanna be a MC? Or do you wanna serve?
Do you wanna be dope? Or do you wanna deal it?
Fabricated acrylic, I feel it, I'm the style molester
I do a show, get Extra P's like the Large Professor
In fact, I get more hoes than Tessa
Peep game like a refe-ree, in sole control of my desti-ny
In the best of three out of five, whip anybody ass at NBA Live
Rappers take a dive like Greg Louganis with his gay-ass
Rather be in Bebe's alley, than at the Clique with gators
Not a hater of the players, I'm more like a coach, or an owner
I Used To Love H.E.R., but now I bone her (Ahuh-hah!)
At one point in rhyme, I thought I lost my erection
But then I got it back with the Resurrection
Blessings upon rhymes, old man who called him traitor
Big Com-stradamus, niggas styles I predict
I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win
And I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E
And can't no other brother cook these delicacies
Well, I'm the P-L-U, the G-to-the-One
Walk around the planet Earth, makin' money, havin' fun
Walk around the planet Earth, makin' money, havin' fun
Walk around the planet Earth, makin' money, havin' fun

I'm the most from the coast of the Eastern flav'
Droppin' more knowledge than litter on the New York pave'
It's me, Wonder Why, in the place to be
Certified as superior MC
While others explore to make it hardcore
I make it hard for wack MC's to even step inside the door
'Cause these kids is rhymin' sometimin'
And when we get to racin' on the mic, they line up to see
The lyrical killin', with stained egos on the ceilin'
My rhymes escalates like black death rates
Over musical plates, bein' played as the rule
Kids thinkin' steppin' to the Soul, you're labelled fools
Who claims to drop jewels, but for now you do the catchin'
I don't worry on what crew you run
Or what section of earth you reside
You're not even a MAN
So I don't deem it MANdatory takin' your pride
But I will, 'cause my man said Soulful Delight
You cry "Keepin' it real", yet you should try keepin' it right
That's understanding microphone mathematics
Which leads to currency and temporary world status
And when one shows he pose threat to this one
This one will make that one into none
Simple equation, zero! You shouldn't play hero
If you can't stand Strong like the Island I'm from
Well, I'm the P-L-U, the G-to-the-One
Walk around the planet Earth, makin' money, havin' fun
Yeah, and I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win
And I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E
And can't another brother cook these delicacies
See, can't another brother cook these delicacies
See, can't another brother cook these delicacies

Ahh, that's how, that's how I'm supposed to do my thing, huh
Like triple it, aight
That's how we do it, all the way from Strong Island to Chicago
The type of freestyler flow
Yeah, it's fluid, it ain't even a flow no mo', hah

Let me tell you a little somethin' about the Self (Tell 'em, Self)
I be a piece of the East Coast
So give a toast to Plug Wonder Why
Back in the day who soaked his words in ginger
So when I ran a phrase in June, you didn't catch it 'til December
I'm a member of them kids from the inner city
Givin' you kiddies audible treats, you be achin' for
Makin' more money than a pagan holiday
Not from the PJ's, yet I still got somethin' to say12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"And now for my next number, I'd like to return to the classics
Perhaps the most famous classic in all the world of music—"
The first time around, you didn't quite understand our new style of
Speak
(Don't worry, we can fix that right now)
So why don't you all just grab your bags
(Come on aboard, hoist the anchor, and we'll be off)
(And good luck to both of you)
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One

Answering any other service
Prerogative praised positively I'm acquitted
Enemies publicly shame my ability
After the battle they admit that I'm with it
Simply soothe, will move vinyl like glue
Transistors are never more shown with
Like wind, vocal flow brings it all down in ruin
Due to a clue of a naughty noise called plug tunin'

("Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm")

Flock to the preacher called Pos
Let him be the stir to the style of your stew
Sit while the kid of the Plug form aroma
Then grab a Daisy to sip your favorite brew
Lettin' this soul fire be your first prior
But don't let the kick drum stub your big toe
See that the three will be your thread
But like my man Chuck D said, 'What a brother know'
Dance while I play and the cue cards sway
From my flower girls China and Jette
The button is pressed, in '89 we'll start the panic
From De La Soul and a Prince from Stet
Negative noise will be all divided
Dangerous to dance, Posdnuos will croon
Ducks and kizids will all be rid
When paying position to the naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'
("Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm")

Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two

Freeze cause these are the brothers
Brothers of the Soul who present a new flick
Every last viewer is tuned to the method
Known to be a method, no magicians, not a trick
Bitten by the spoken who been titled Plug Two
Swallowed by the loonies who are jealous with the showbiz
Dove'll teach the truth, Posdnuos will preach the youth
To the fact that this will bring an end to the negative
Flow to the sway cause I say fa-so-la-ti
At the top we will dwell
Difference is fame and we rise then we build
Where we are set, we get fat and we swell
Motions of the Soul is a positive stride
One step forward is the space we consume
Vivid as the moon, you have yet to assume
How the Soul found the motto of a naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'
("Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm")

Vocal is local so believe that
This chant sends L.I. on the strong map
Trying and live so you best realize
That the gift that I present, I say gift wrap
Style of the Tune is personal
And defining what's the rhyme is worst of all
Stop, sit and study cause the meaning isn't muddy
Just preach and do the gear as the first of all
Watch while the pitcher is pitching
'Cause this is the pitch of the year
Sing a simple song but keep the swing strong
Though you heard Dove crying, I ain't fearing
Those who think De La's on the flip tip
Try to flip this and you're doomed
Watch for the B-B cause if you try to grieve me
You'll be hung by the wire of the Plug Tune

("Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm")

(I can't twist your arm and make you stay with me)
(Are you ready for this?)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Shadow you're drawn, why don't you go?
In the corner babe watching the snow
Moving afar, rolling away
You weren't the one to leave, now won't you stay?
Won't you stay, babe?
Won't you stay, babe?

Oh, I never know what come around
I never looked ahead
I'm wreckin' rules and it's pulling us down
The words I wished I'd said
Shadow you're drawn and you got your ways
Shadow you're painted red, red

Moving afar, rolling away
You weren't the one to leave, now won't you stay?
Won't you stay, babe?
Won't you stay, babe?

It's drawn

One, two
Yo, I’m what the paper plate couldn’t hold
Too many dreams, a paperweight took a toll
Food on the floor, not to be wasted
Or doing what’s being pasted and know that it’s not a copy
Eye on the prize, instead of gas prices
Lyrically wonder why I travel past the nicest
Born of a generation that don't generate patience
And travel too fast for you to clock me
Not always a good thing
You can lose the love of your life to a lifetime of love on tour
I didn't mean to be a whore but my hormones
Had me like a fiend screamin' "What you got for me?"
Two words (I'm mortal)
But the fans slid 'em both together and removed the apostrophe
"Hip hop lords"? Maybe, but my ways needs laundering
Time's a-ticking, stop squandering!5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Break of-

I was born in the Boogie Down catscan
Where my building fell down on the rats and
People sold the super on a trip to the penile (penile)
While I settle off the shores of the Long Isle
My file is clean, I mean my mind is clear when I transmit
I am the man-ner of the family cuz the pants fit
I want to let forensics prove, that I can mends Groove
Wit the thread from needle outta hay, I wanna say
Salutations to the nation of the Nubians
We bout to place you in that 3 Feet of stew again
I got the frequency to shatter Mrs. Jones' perm
I gotta "hey love" all the honies cause they're short term
Tallyin the score I'm for the shottie in the jacket
For the brother he's a nigga when he packs it
So get your butt out the sling, I stung Muhammad float a note
That means I'm def, so like the autographs you sign until the

Break of-

Ayo, groove with the mayor, hazard on the sayer
Wave the eighteen mill', eat a still
Sack or bag of troubles, make the single double
Loop the coin and join the minimum wage
I had a plan if I was the man, I'd throw the J
Lay it low and late night I get sessed
Uncondition my ways, of the everyday sunset
Wagin my days, to the one bet
Cause your breaks'll have the carrot of cakes, whether mine
Out of line, I breeze into the early mornin'
Freak the WIC call and get a tap on my shoulder
Cause the days of the breaks, be just about over
The arts of the six won't play my bag of tricks
I got the sevens in my pocket somewhere
Reasons for the Cheer All Temperature here
I keep it to the rear, and then I'm exploding
I be the fab, I be the fabulous but see unlike the Chi
I got the flea up in the name (ah one two, ah one two)
Can't no one bend my cousin from the Peter Piper like the others
Latchin on to when I caught the fame (ah one two, ah one two)
Pass the task to ask me bout the Native Tongue again my friend
I tell you Jungle Brothers On the Run (ah one two, ah one two)
I'm shakin hands with many devils in the industry
Believe the Genesis like Phil with stills mean that I'm def
So like the autographs you sign until the

We in the mornin' at the end, but in the end I be the is
Cause in the mix, man, it's alright
Momma got the rhythm to my day-life
My pops gots enough so best to leave or sail the waves
To the Long I laid the anchor in the 'Ville
And how I relate, I stay inside of my gates
Paper days, mess up my mind, ground zero degrees
And the weather feels fine
You opened my eyes man, thought I had a man
But how could I eye-scan, I wasn't around
I seen the states and played the dates in the far-far
Gathered the new, from the zoas around
Grew up with Mikey Rodes and played the codes
Sometimes I don't budge, without my cous' Fuzz
A simple, "How ya do?" Ah check it from my friends and my crew
Makes it definitely special
Now there's no Shiny Happy People in the crew we play the rough
I got the huff, and puff, to blow the house low
You know the never-ending factor while I'm over, tell a squid
I know an Enterprising brother, so report to the bridge
I bounce a ball with my left, a squid with my right
(Cause a squid is just a punk) Yo he deserved to lose the fight
I might meander 'cross your dream, travellin' up the stream
Plug Wonder Wonder Why you're lonely tonight
We see the girls scream as if we're shocked by the live shell
Let's round em up and get 'em back to the hotel
Motel, holiday, inn-fact
I'm gonna let you know, once again, that De La Soul
Is sure to show you we will hit the charter harder
Than the normal rappin' fool

Party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get your ass up, and let's get ill
That's right y'all, we more than rough, we callin' your bluff
And when it comes to rhymes... (Brick City)

Yo, don't scandalize
Mine, I spent too much time
Straight talk with the catch to etch my line walk
Never fetchin' for crime, halt! Who goes there?
Yo, it's the squeeze of five fingers, puffin' Smokey the Bear
Shinin' black like Darth Vader caps, they on stare
While we rockin' it, I'll rock in it (rock in it)
Like the little ball inside the spray can providing three
Coats for both child, woman and man

God bless the God, lay these streets wall to wall
It go, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!
Yo, you got popped like a flick by that rivalry clique
It went, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!

It ain't my fault your ass is on the asphalt ('Phalt)
Got your chin touched by my fam who though you brought harm, you see
I'm iced out like a glass of tea, better yet, oatmeal cookies
Y'all just rookies to me
Slidin' up and down the court, but I don't think you can D
Why try? Maseo be gettin' high since Luke was Luke Skywalk' (Yo'), man, my
Topic of talk is sheddin' shame all over your game
Like them shorties who claim that afrocentric lovin' is the past drug
A life filled with (*GUNS*)—that's what thugs love
Snatch you fast, wrap that ass
In the rug of your choice while it muffles your voice
Now when I'm swimmin' through the joint
I put the funk on hold
'Cause if you don't, you'll see the bubbles come up
We run up a tab
And gladly add a little extra for miss
Flashy faces with bigger lips for that ass to kiss
Most crews are post-current while we're forever
Direct beats that's contagious, loved by all ages
Graduated from the you-and-I-versity
Of hard-hitters, for real
I got niggas in the streets that'll blast your ass for the shine and get
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!
Yo, if you a fat chick gettin' your fuck on tonight then go
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!
Yo, put your hands opposite to the ground if you're lovin' our sound
Go, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!
Yo, and to my broke niggas on the corner holdin' me down
Go, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!

Yo, I swear Tommy gonna get it, he done did me wrong
I had plans to buy more land, plant corn
Bust kernels on heat, work hard like wetbacks
Set backs is gonna get my ass P.E. hostile
Rockwilder the beat, top dollar defeat (Uh-huh)
Big money's make the big decisions, keep hip-hop
Alive, it's just an intermission
Back to the second half of the feature flick
Dick stacks and fuck rap
I had a name for makin' paper since papier-mâché (C'mon)
Now my dollar coins join pounds of yen for play
While you broke niggas reach drunk much quicker
You don't make enough bread to soak up all your liquor
Went from God to God damn, damn God, you're killin' it
Should incorporate it, invest half a mil' in it
Rap cats talk with no will in it
Soundin' like they virtual, this joint'll hurt you, yo
Twas the night before Christmas and my crib got robbed
They did a job, took all the goodies
Out from under the tree (Word up?), except the CDs
Of shiny-suit rappers and flossin' emcees
Who fail at takin' it to rhyme degrees
Man, you know no wack poems get no play in our homes (Nah man)
You need to not get nappy with me
Or else we gon' relax your mind, let your conscious be free
Yo, where my Wall Street niggas, if ya up in the stands, go
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!
To my women that'll throw they hands against they punk-ass man, go
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!
Yo, if you never been shot or stabbed, Brick City go
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!
Yo, I gotta catch a cab back to the lab so I can smoke

Oooh noo-ohhh, noo-ohhh
Oooh noo-ohhh, noo-ohhh!
Oooh noo-ohhh, noo-ohhh
Oooh noo-ohhh, noo-ohhh!

It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you
It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you

I don't care about what you think you see
The things you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been through and paid my dues
Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all on you, woah, oh, yeah

I wish that, you could be a little bit more upfront
Weigh the situation how you want (right)
The loving that you claim is just a four letter word
The third letter's inviting so visualize the verb
You curve thought waves when you're handling the candelabra
So you sitting on the baby grand
Transmitting like you're made of man
But you paint a funny face like a chick
When I see you I'ma tell you quick that uhh
It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you
It ain't all good, and that's the truth

I can't believe we built this large pizza pie together
No pepperoni
Yeah you wanted extra cheese, sometimes I gave you extras
How we divided slices like the Red Sea theory
I was Moses hopelessly scorned by your thorn Zipporah
Tried to bring that fairy-tale life, you wanted horror
But my microscope couldn't see or cope with that
I had to bolt from that, and left you dead in the sea
It's better for me, I'm satisfied with repping for D

We were certified hot, then dropped to lukewarm
Now we back up in the spot, claiming never been gone
Niggas who cut us off, wanna reattach us now
(Them girls who brushed us off, say they want some #'s to dial)
Yeah I give that ass a number, and some lumber to pile
Now catch a curve from my kick (or show me loving by brick)
So stick to the same plan, don't come shaking my hand
Like we peeps, it ain't beef but be sure to understand
Between us, it ain't all
It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you
It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you

You see them kids be scheming on what we done copped
Always out there scheming!
They steady fiending for the moment they can get us off the block
Why they always fiending?
Your people might have your back, but you need to watch your front
Indeed, ain't nothing guaranteed
That's the truth! Things ain't goin' like you think they should
A lot say they wanna walk in my size 10's
Alright then; here's a pair
Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me
You see ain't no young boys up in here; keep a clear head
Trying to keep my pockets on stuffed, like deer heads
Upon the wall, so all the gall we get from y'all don't phase
So mind your biz and walk away
'Cause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze

I don't care about what you think you see
The things you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been through and paid my dues
Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all on you, woah, oh, yeah
It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you
It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Access to her code
Lovestruck was my mode
Took a look, dropped my textbook
Jenifa... (oh!)
Breakfast, broke it fast
She was in my English class
Asked for notes, rocked my boat
Jenifa... (oh!)
Jenny, lost her favorite penny
So I gave her a dollar
She kissed me (and I hollered)
In a flash the school bell rang
Jenny grabbed on to my hand
Took me home and said, Trugoy just
Swing and swing and swing

The downstairs, where we met
I brought records, she cassettes
Lost the breaks, found her shape
Jenifa, oh Jeny
Transcripts showed more than flirt
"I love Daisies" read her shirt
Grabbed my jeans, Jimmy screamed
Jenifa, oh Jeny
Marvelous, shaped like a vase
No one can live their life for Pos
Found a house, aroused my joust
Jenifa, oh Jeny
Her clothes, I did shuck
Just like Dan, I strictly stuck
To the punt, she cried, "Kick it"
Posdnuos was in
Jenny
Only thought about Jimmy
But asked was I a virgin
Like some kid named Derwin?
She said, "Let’s try it in the bathroom"
But ’dnuos is way above sinks
So to the kitchen she did Dan
And came back wrapped in Saran
Now waaaaaait a minute! Little Derwin got something to show us that Jenny could never do!
Listen...
Hey, look at little Derwin! Look at him go! Look at him go!
Awww, baby

Positions, muscles flexed
Dove was lost in a gon-a-hex
Passed her test, felt her teddy
Jenifa, oh Jeny
Notions soothed the mood
Dove was lost in De La heaven
Screwed plug two, did the do
Jenifa oh Jeny
Jeny
Teased my homeboy Granny
In fact she teased so many
She was known as a garden tool

No more I dispatched
Was it Jimmy had met his match
Or could it be the realization
All girls owned a Jeny
For normal health, I had fought
A valuable lesson she had taught
Don’t flaunt that the candy is good
Unless you came with plenty1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I am Shortie
I be 4'11"

I am Posdnous
I be the new generation of slaves
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes
The pile of revenue I create
But I guess I don't get a cut cuz my rent's a month late
Product of a North Carolina cat
Who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie
Who departed life just a little too soon
And didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame
As we go a little somethin' like this
Look ma, no protection
Now I got a daughter named Ayana Monet
And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough
So the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay
I am an early bird but the feathers are black
So the apples that I catch are usually all worms
But it's a must to decipher one's queen
From a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ
I cherish the twilight
I maximize, my soul is the right size
I watch for the power to run out on the moon
(And that'll be sometime soon)
Faker than a fist of kids
Speakin that they're black
When they're just niggas trying to be Greek
Or some tongues who lied
And said "We'll be natives to the end"
Nowadays we don't even speak
I guess we got our own life to live
Or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule?
Every now and then I step to the now
For now I see back then I might have acted like a fool
Now I won't apologize for it
This is not a bunch of Bradys
But a bunch of black man's pride
Yet I can safely say
I've never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside
I've always walked the right side of the road
If I wasn't making song I wouldn't be a thug selling drugs
But a man with a plan
And if I was a rug cleaner
Betcha Pos'd have the cleanest rugs I am
The Plug Two brand with the flavour
In the flute watch the sniffin'
So a sack of shows in demand
I read the diction from the second page
I got the one-two gauge
Baritone to the izm fan
Trees fall so I can play ground with my ink
So let me need ya to my ems go
I push the infinite and carry it
My carrier's the three over one
So my pluggins already know
Lick shots with moo
Catch the boo
From a ghost in the heckling crowd
If I give a foot
Jack Ville caught a spill
When a still came from my mouth
I brought a head down south
I don't check for the noose and the neck
So I never tell my ems
That finesse is knocking at my door
I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun
And dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore
I bring the element H with the 2
So ya owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade
It's just mind over matter
And what matters is
That the mind isn't guided by the punished shade
I keep the walking on the right side
But I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong
Cuz that's how he wants to be
No difference, see
I wanna be like the name of this song I am
I am Posdnous
I be the new generation of slaves
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes
The pile of revenue I create
But I guess I don't get a cut cuz my rent's a month late
The deeds of a natural
Are seeds that are no longer planted
So the famine in the mind is strong
Tactics of another plane is now proven sane
Sane enough to let you know from within this song
I stabilize many cableized viewers
So my occupation's known
But not why I occupy
And that is to bring the peace
Not in the flower but the As-Salaam Alaikum in the third I am2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"If you will suck my soul
I will lick your funky emotions"

This is the stylin' for a title that sounds silly
But nothin' silly about the triflin' times of Millie
Millie a Brooklyn Queen originally from Philly
Complete with that accent that made her sound hillbilly
Around this time the slammin' joint was “Milk is Chillin'”
But even cooler was my social worker Dillon
Yeah I had a social worker 'cuz I had some troubles
Anyone who'd riff on me, I'd pop their dome like bubbles
He'd bring me to his crib to watch my favorite races
That's how his daughter Millie became one of my favorite faces
She had the curves that made you wanna take chances
I mean on her, man, I'd love to make advances
I guess her father must 'a got the same feelin'
I mean, actually findin' his own daughter Millie appealing
At the time no one knew but it was a shame
That Millie became a victim of the touchy-touchy game

Yo Millie, what's the problem, lately you've been buggin'
On your dookie earrings, someone must be tuggin'
You were a dancer who could always be found clubbin'
Now you're world renowned with the frown you're luggin'
Come to think your face look stink when Dill's around you
He's your father-what done happen-did he ground you?
You shouldn't flip on him 'cuz Dill is really cool
Matter of fact, the coolest elder in the school
He hooked up a trip to bring us all the Lacey
He volunteered to play old Santa Claus at Macy's
Child, ya got the best pops anyone could have
Dillon's cool, super hip, you should be glad
Yeah, it seemed that Santa's ways were parallel with Dillon
But when Millie and him got home, he was more of a villain
While she slept in he crept inside her bedroom
And he would toss her and then would force her to give him head room
Millie tried real hard to let this hell not happen
But when she'd fuss, he would just commence the slappin'
(Yo Dillon man, Millie's been out of school for a week, man, what's the deal?)
I guess he was givin' Millie's bruises time to heal
Of course he told us she was sick and we believed him
And at the department store as Santa we would see 'em
And as he smiled, his own child was at home plottin'
How off the face of this earth she was gonna knock him
When I got home, I found she had tried to call me
My machine had kicked to her hey how ya doin' (sorry)
I tried to call the honey but her line was busy
I guess I'll head to Macy's and bug out on Dillon

I received a call from Misses Sick herself
I asked her how was she recoverin' her health
She said that what she had to ask would make it seem minute
She wanted to talk serious, I said, "go ahead-shoot"
She claimed I hit the combo dead upon the missile
Wanted to know if I could get a loaded pistol
That ain't a problem but why would Millie need one
She said she wanted her pops Dillon to heed one
Ran some style about him pushin' on her privates
Look honey, I don't care if you kick five fits
There's no way that you can prove to me that Dill's flip
He might breathe a blunt but ya jeans he wouldn't rip
You're just mad he's your overseer at school
No need to play him out like he's someone cruel
She kicked that she would go get it from somewhere else
Yeah, whatever you say, go for ya self
Macy's department store, the scene for Santa's kisses
And all the little brats demandin' all of their wishes
Time passes by as I wait for my younger brother
He asks his wish, I waste no time to return him back to Mother
As I'm jettin', Millie floats in like a zombie
I ask her what's her problem, all she says is "Where is he?"
I give a point, she pulls a pistol, people screamin'
She shouts to Dill, “He's off to hell cuz he's a demon!”
None of the kids could understand what was the cause
All they could see was a girl holdin' a pistol on Claus
Dillon pleaded mercy, said he didn't mean to
Do all the things that her mind could do nothing but cling to
Millie bucked him and with the quickness it was over3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
