Every single morning
Wake up in the afternoon (Yeah)
Cover up the mirror
Just to get a better view (Yeah)
Been around the world and never even left the room (Ah)

And I, I can't figure out
Why?
So I just scream and shout

I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm going crazy
Going crazy, Going crazy
I believe I'm losing my mind

Everybody's looking at me, but I don't see them
Living for the weekend, caught in the deep end
Tryin'a tread water, do it for my unborn daughter
Lamb to the slaughter, life's getting shorter
Tryin'a get high off a quarter
I'm fly in a saucer, my life is a corker
Star, pop bottles, date top models
Middle finger in the air, not a care, going full throttle
Where's the love though?
Nobody cares about that, where's the club? Where's the drugs though? Front row
Follow the flow, Megaupload
Feel the adrenaline rush, who's the mug though? I don't know
I
I can't figure out
Why?
So I just scream and shout?
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm going crazy
Going crazy, Going crazy
I believe I'm losing my mind

Living in a bubble, my life is a puzzle
I'm caught in the rubble, now pass me a shovel
Now pass me a shot, and make it a double
I'm a whole lot of trouble and I don't do subtle
It's all or nothing, I don't wanna juggle
No crabs in a bucket, I don't wanna huddle
I've got my own name, tryn'a figure out the whole game
Going insane, 150 in the slow lane
Getting ahead of myself
My God, already thinking how can I better myself
Should I be somebody else? Should I be pacing myself?
My car's a rocket, and if I get too carried away, I wouldn't know when to stop it
I
I can't figure out
Why?
So I just scream and shout?
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm going crazy
Going crazy, Going crazy
I believe I'm losing my mind

Tryna get a hold of
Tryin'a get a hold of you
Yo, I'm goin in fearless, man, I'm wildin out
Don't even try and get a hold of me
Tryin'a get control of
Tryin'a get control of me
Yo, I've lost it, its gone
I'm tryna warn - hey, listen!
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm going crazy
Going crazy, going crazy

What the fuck? What are you doing?
Don't touch it
Don't. Who told you to touch it? I will fucking kill you
Don't ever touch that fucking shit again

I'm a fiend for a big dirty bassline
When I hear one I have a great time
A bit of bottom end's all what I require
I let the bassline take me higher
My friends think that it's a bad habit
But I'm just like fuck you, damn it
If you take my bass away
I'll blow your fucking face away (easy!)
You might think I'm over the top
But when I hear that bassline drop (What!)
I just can't control my actions
But I still feel satisfaction
So don't come around here whinging
I just wanna hear the bassline rinsin'
Or we can just skank out all day
If not get the fuck out my way
I don't need no speed (no)
I don't need no heroin (no thanks)
I don't want no coke (not today)

The other day I got an ASBO order
And I think it's well out of order
All my neighbors throwing a fit
So I told them suck my dick
And I told them I got the power
And I turn the music up louder
All night till six in the morning
Old bastards, they just boring
You know me, I'm the bassline father
Nobody can't tell me nada
And the police turned up and they took me
We drove out to the nick and they booked me
When they said they'd give me a caution
If I didn't give them no distortion
But I said don't bother, I'm guilty
And my bassline's fucking filthy

Oh, oh
Ooh, baby
Come and dance with me

What's up, darlin'?
I been keeping my eye on your movement
I can't see no room for improvement
Why you all over there on your Jack Jones?
You need to let me get behind your backbone
'Cause I'm the man for the job, let me work it
I won't waste no time, I'll make it worth it
One hundred percent, I'll make it perfect
You got a body to die for, let me merk it
Now it's murder on the dance floor
I wanna take this further than the dance floor
I ain't forceful but I'm still hardcore
You're gonna give me everything I ask for
It's not a long ting, you're the boom ting
Maybe more than a hotel room ting
I'll never know if I just walk past
I really wanna dance, so I guess I'll just ask

She ain't no ho
Look at those thighs, it's in her eyes, she's good to go
She can satisfy my mind, body and soul
Come and dance with me, come and dance with me
Come and dance with me, come dance with me
I see you glance at me, that's why I'm asking, B
So let's party, B, come and dance with me
If I'm out on my own, then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date, then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar, tell your boyfriend hold your jar
And dance with me
I see you glance at me, that's why I'm asking, B
So let's party, B, come and dance with me

Yo, it goes on and on
I see you get excited like this is my song
You think I wanna get involved, you are not wrong
'Cause I been waiting for this moment all night long
So I creep, creep, creep like TLC
I got my left eye checking out your scenery
I got my right eye right where it needs to be
Don't matter how I look at it, you look good to me
Still, I'm looking for the perfect view
The way I see it, that's right next to you
I know you've probably heard it before but still
I love it when you flex like that for real
So don't stop doing what you do when you do it
I just wanna be a part of it when you do it
I'll feel like a wally if I don't pursue it
And I can't go through it, so let's get to it
She ain't no ho
Look at those thighs, it's in her eyes, she's good to go
She can satisfy my mind, body and soul
Come and dance wiv me, come and dance wiv me
Come and dance wiv me, come dance wiv me
I see you glance at me, that's why I'm asking, B
So let's party, B, come and dance with me

I know you didn't come out to stand and stare
You bought new shoes and you did up your hair
You made a real effort tonight and it shows
I can tell by your face you don't wanna be alone
'Cause the mood is right and the time is now
And if you can't do it, I'll show you how
All you gotta do is get loose, let go
Just throw a couple shapes, put your skills on show, oh
Put your skills on show

If I'm out on my own, then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date, then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar, tell your boyfriend hold your jar
And dance with me
I see you glance at me, that's why I'm asking, B
So let's party, B, come and dance with me
If I'm out on my own, then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date, then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar, tell your boyfriend hold your jar

All I do is flex, I don't need a reason
All I want is sex, I don't need a reason
Fly out on a jet, I don't need a reason
Every day's a never ending summer season
All eyes on me

160, blink and miss me
Super nifty, riding swiftly
Rolling through the sticks
Leather extra crispy, effortlessly
Power steering, accurately, ready for action, actually
Mellow, relaxed and cocking my snapback
Not taking no God damn back chat
Just racking up fat stacks
No ring, no chain, no fat chaps
I don't get no sleep, no cat naps
And everybody wanna be on my black sack
But I don't slack
You don't really wanna see me get abstract
I'll switch up the place like have that
Don't care about none of that rap crap
Steer clear of the rat trap
Some say that I lack tact
But I'm on the map
And I'm setting the pace, I'm on track
So get out my face, I'm on slapping
I'm on scrapping, so stop yapping, what's crackalacking?
Don't follow fashion, just keeping it G
With these hoes, macking, and that's what's happening
What?
That's what's happening
All I do is flex, I don't need a reason
All I want is sex, I don't need a reason
Fly out on a jet, I don't need a reason
Every day's a never ending summer season
All eyes on me

God bless me, nobody can't test me
Everyday life can't stress me, stay on the ball like Messi
Money and women are the only things that impress me
I stay fly and sexy
Life is a game of chess, and all the girls wanna check me
How much do you wanna bet me, that I never ever let a female sweat me?
Get me
I ain't gotta talk no more, cause soon as I walk in the door everybody stops doing what they're doing, don't know what they're pausing for, don't know what they're gawping for
Bad boy from the LDN, what the world's been calling for, been balling for
And your girl gets wet, stays up in the morning for
Don't know what you're stalling for
Get with the programme, I got the flow and I've got the dough and money to blow
And, this ain't a slow jam, ready to rock and I'm ready to roll, I'm gripping at the Trojan
Never gonna get caught slipping, never gonna get caught tripping
Never too soft on the women
If it ever gets too hot in the kitchen, I'm dipping, I ain't gonna stand there dripping, I'm missing

All I do is flex, I don't need a reason
All I want is sex, I don't need a reason
Fly out on a jet, I don't need a reason
Every day's a never ending summer season
All eyes on me
International, flex and go
When I'm at home, I stay low
Yo, lay in the cut, they can't see me bro
And I'm living it up, they can't be me though
Get on the mic, I get easy dough
When I'm cutting the cheques, cause I'm C.E.O
Keep on fronting, like you don't know
I stay repping the Manor, and that's E3, Bow
Stay with a brownin', get around the town, you better hold it down
I'll leave you breathing slow
Overstand, cause I ain't even clowning, I'll leave you drowning from head to toe
Wet, why you trying to put me in check?
I play for keeps, you better know I don't pet
Knock your head off your shoulders, no sweat, watch your step

All I do is flex, I don't need a reason
All I want is sex, I don't need a reason
Fly out on a jet, I don't need a reason
Every day's a never ending summer season
All eyes on me10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I wake up everyday it's a daydream
Everythin' in my life ain't what it seems
I wake up just to go back to sleep
I act real shallow but I'm in too deep
And all I care about is sex and violence
A heavy bass line is my kind of silence
Everybody says that I gotta get a grip
But I let sanity give me the slip

Some people think I'm bonkers
But I just think I'm free
Man, I'm just livin' my life
There's nothin' crazy about me
Some people pay for thrills
But I get mine for free

Some whore banging on your door, what for?
Pregnant? What're you talking about? Be sure
Fifteen, she's underage, that's raw
And against law, 5 years or more
Now she wants a score and half of a draw
That's the kind of threat that you can't ignore
That whore got you pinned down to the floor
But it's your own fault, you said three magic words (I love you)
When that's the one for the birds
When you said that she forgot other boys
It's over, you better start buying her toys
There was no intention of her being wife
Now she knows this, she's ending your life
It's a real shame you got had by the whores
It's a shame that kid probably ain't yours
That girl' some bitch ya know
She keep calling my phone, she don't leave me alone

Bitch, no, you're not ready for skid row
Bleed no, Dizzee Rascal deep roll
Big feet, feel the force on my big toe
I got no chaps, no chains, not much dough
Get juiced but you don't get love though
No slap but you might get a co-co (Yo)
Jambo coming through like Rambo
Love ting takes two like tango

Lyrical clientele but I ain't a bocat, I don't like the smell
I'm gonna go through a shell and make a boy feel unwell (Yo)

That girl gives brains, that girl gives knowledge
That girl gives head, that girl gives shines
That girl gives BJs at all times
She looks decent, she looks fine
But don't talk about wifey she's not mine
She got batteried, 6 in a line (Uh), believe me that's not a good sign

Being a celebrity don't mean shit to me (Woo)
Fuck the glitz and glamour, hit 'em with the Blitz and Hammer (Woo)
Because they're talking 'bout rushing
Talk behind my back but to my face, they say nothing
Stand up in the dance, keep a firm steady stance
Keep the beanies touching, keep the beanies hot flushing (Woo)

Fellas wanna stop me, they'll probably come together
It's probable they'll stop me, probably never (Woo)
Yo, topboy, topman, or top ah topper
Come to me with an attitude, come a cropper
I'm old school like Happy Shopper
I fight old school, bring your bat and your chopper (Woo)

"Discovery. Four computers now have primary control of critical vehicle functions."
"Roger roll, Discovery"

Gotta know your role, better state your case

Space, you should wanna embrace
Space, space, space
"Discovery. Go at throttle up."
Rip up and ravage, make it a habit for damage
Whole lotta baggage, you will not manage, I'm the full package
Why do they talk like I am not established? That is so callous, they are the saddest
Why are they so full of malice? Making up fallacies, I'm in my palace blazing up the chalice with Alice
'Cause I'm a gyalist and I'm the baddest, it's not a travesty
Call me "Your Majesty," sometimes it feels like world's on my phallus
Push out my chest and I big up my status
Where's all the trappers? Where's all the clappers?
I am not shaken, no need for maracas
Or apparatus, put in the work and spend money on motors and slappers
Why are we frontin' like it even matters?
Why do they make me feel guilty for gettin' this money like my soul's in tatters?
Sittin' here tryna realign my chakras
Driving me crackers, you bloody spackers should get off my knackers
Give me the gas and the matches, I've been through hell and I swallowed the ashes, running this ting for so long as it happens, I'm knackered
All of my enemies broken and shattered, sprinkling hate, they're all over the shop and they're scattered
Chatting my name till this day and I'm flattered, I am not easily rattled
Don't follow the cattle, so quiet your chatter or you will get battered
Can't find enough time to dine on these rappers, all of these MCs are looking like tapas
Fuck all the swine and their bodily gases, roll with the rastas, Babylon's calling me, nobody's fooling me
I do not roll with the masses, but big up the Junglist massive
I am not timid and I am not passive, messing with me? You must be on some acid
Don't want the racket, I will get erratic, all my problems disappear like it's magic
It'll be tragic
Ain't no point in playin' it safe
Gotta know your role, better state your case
When it all falls down better know your place
Just gimme three feet and an ounce of

Yeah, uh

Don't pet or pander, leave 'em hanging
I'll be damned, man to man
Hit him with an open hand, release the anger
WorldStar, you could get dealt with on camera
Understand my grammar, I don't stutter, lisp or stammer
Watch me blaze the beat, I must admit it hit just like a hammer
It's a banger for the mandem on the street and in the slammer
Bang your doors, bang your doors for the cause
Breaking laws, breaking jaws, open paws
Poker board, taking scores, and be sure
Never let a bredda get one over yours
Never put money over whores, maybe or it's crazy flawed, it's a myth, life's a gift, made me pause, catch my drift, smoke a spliff and get in them draws
Paid the cost to be the boss, ball and floss, Jesus died, he nailed himself into the cross
Still couldn't please these backwards shit cunts, why would I take a loss?
Giving a toss, know your worth, hold your turf, fuck the earth, and shake it off
Breddas on my line talkin' 'bout, "Yo, Raskit, break me off"
They’re wafer soft, I'm taking off
"Three, two, one, zero, and lift off"
"Lift off of Kepler-41b. The first flight of the Orbiter Discovery and the shuttle has cleared the tower

Get your passport and your bikini
You need a holiday, come see me
I know you're tired of the same old scenery
And I could change all that so easily
Don't worry 'bout a thing, girl, take a chance
I'll take you to the south of France
Like Cannes, and if anybody can, I can
We could both shop in the Milan
I just hope you understand
I hope you see it clear
It really don't matter how far or near
'Cause there's no distance
That could stop my persistence
Just a few days of the year
Plus I've got clout, so let's ride out
We ain't gotta fly, we can just drive out
We can have a rave or we can hide out
Won't tell nobody, let them find out

If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
Don't watch my passport photo, I know I look a bit loco
And I know that my Spanish is so-so
But let's try keep that on the low-low
Cause we're going Ibiza
I've got friends that really wanna meet ya
With champagne and a whole lot of reefa
It's all good darling, a Blue Marlin will please ya
And I'll never let your belly get empty
Even when your belly full you're still sexy
We can ride speed boats, we can ride jet skis
I'll show you the time of your life if you let me
I just want to put a smile on your pretty face
If I didn't it would just be your pretty waste
You do look like a girl with a bit of taste
So I couldn't take you just any place

If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
I know you're really busy and I know you got plans
But are you really too busy for a sun tan?
I ain't talking about walking down the high street
I'm talking about laying on a bright white beach
With a Pina Colada or whatever you'd rather
White wine, that's fine, just give me a lager
Then after we'll take a truck to the night spot
The hot spot, the top spot, party around the clock
And when we get there it's strictly VIP
No need for ID, security know me
No waiting in line, no high entry fee
Don't worry about nothing when you're beside me
I'll get you lively and loosen you up
Have a bit of champagne, it'll boost you up
I wanna move you up, I wanna take you away
So have a word, darling, what do you say?

If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing, let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, babyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

New York, LA, Tokyo, Berlin, Miami, Rio, Milan, Ibiza
I love all these places, but there's no place like home
I love my city

I go hard in the city of London
I get a lot of love, all smiles when I step in the function
I’m a local boy, I’m from the east side
Now I’m jet settin, I’m reppin, I’ll do it worldwide
When I was a kid there was a rough ride
Barely had the money for a bus ride, now I’m on the upside
Having a ball with all the breders I grew up with
A couple of women I’m in the club with
Bottle the bubbly, feeling lovely, women are hugging me
Nobody could tell me nothing and nobody can never trouble me
It’s all good, pure positive vibes
For the most part everybody’s just tryna live their lives
We’re not afraid to die, only the strong survive
You don’t know if you don’t try, the stakes are high
And it’s the city where I earned my crown
God knows that I love this town

The city lights are extra bright
They shine for us tonight
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town
Let me buy you another round
And show you how my peeps get down
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town
It’s just one big melting pot
Every creed colour and race, we got the lot
And I love to shop, there's not a brand that can't be copped
No more than a couple of stops
Where should I begin?
Might see me in the west side getting it in
Might see me on the north side getting a trim
South side of the river in a race car having a spin, I just win
And I’m never gonna lose with the city to guide me
Got the vibe of the city inside me and the streets are lively
Got a whole lot of love and I'm connect it
It’s 7 million people behind me, don’t try me
‘Cuz right now we’re gonna rave it up
Set the roof on fire and blaze it up
And we’re in it to win it
There’s no limit so we raise it up
We got the dancefloor shaking like, woo

The city lights are extra bright
They shine for us tonight
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town
Let me buy you another round
And show you how my peeps get down
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town
I fuckin' love this town

The city lights are extra bright
They shine for us tonight
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town
Let me buy you another round
And show you how my peeps get down
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

And I said "Don't gas me!" (My G)
Must admit one pretty brown ting

And I said... (Whaaat)

Might just pull out the 1210 decks
Might tell my man "Pull out the jet" (What)

Feel so good I might find me a wifey
Buy her some diamonds, have her all icey
But I love a hood girl, 'cause your so feisty
You ain't gotta be so pricey (Love ya)
Cooking up a curry, or mutton and ricey
Cooking up something all pepper and spicey (Hmm)
Put it on my plate, yeah that'll do nicely
You ain't gotta be so shiesty
Feel so good but I still want a prenup
Now I gotta just pre without a feel up (Hmm)
Tell a DJ that I demand a wheel up
And you know I blew the scene up (What)
Why you so vexed boy, chill out and heal up
All I do is make moves and rate my tea cup
Have a Kit Kat rude boy, best you ease up
Take time and get ya P's up (Oi)
Took a bop in the car rolled up
And they said "Swear down"
And I said "Don't gas me!"
They said "Fam you're a star

Ascended masters of angels of light, but you're actually deceiving demonic spirits , which can not only hurt somebody externally, they can destroy their spirits as well

I don't speak queen's English but I'm still distinguished
I don't need no suit or tie to let you know I mean business
I know you're into this
Even even if you were deaf, blind and dumb and awkwardly rhythmless
I'm like syphilis ain't no denying this wickedness
Any attempt would be grimy and hideous
Young and I'm black and I'm ignorant
But I'm still frivolous
Meaning I'm nigga-less
More than the way I feel strength in my pigments
What does it matter? Just give me my dividends
Switching up syllables mixing with criminals
Keep up appearance but keeping it minimal
Bredders be getting too over familiar
Quizzical, touching your physical
Hands on my bread with a spoon in my cereal
Not on my watch cause I'm a hard rock
Come through in a hard top
With your girl in the passenger seat, she getting hard cock
I didn't even let the car stop
Don't even worry what cars I've got
You should be concerned with what you are not
I dictate the pace and set the bar a lot
You get parred a lot
Sorry pardon what?
I can't hear you bro you sound weary bro
Talk shit but you won't come near me though
And I'm far from sweet I'm no Cheerio
I switch up the place real quick like hear we go
Leave your body all black with a whole lot of indigo
Six feet below
No heads up, no intro
No info I get it in bro
Cold world with a whole lot of schemers
It don't stop for the dreamers
You could fuck around and get took to the cleaners
I know man that would do a lot of dirty
Put a lot of work in
Just to ride Benz and Beamers
Devious creatures
Try to steer clear of the preachers
Screaming out 'God can't reach us'
Nothing they can teach us, leave us
Looking for a girl with over the top features
Couldn't care less about Jesus
Couldn't give a fuck about a thesis
Looking for the easiest next top model
Or another shit TV series
Raised by MTV generation
Not a lot of patience
Update Facebook status, no hesitation
How they gonna deal with the wolves of the nation
How they gonna recognize pros and cons with no education
How they gonna win with no dedication
All you really care about is Playstation
World Star Hip Hop humiliation
Everything built on a weak foundation
Whole lot of time being wasted
Whole lot of shit champagne being tasted
Everybody in the club acting basic
Everybody wanna be a star let's face it
Gassed by the money and the fame let's chase it
Gotta get it quick gotta get it by all means
Wanna be a big timer like the guy from New Orleans
Got big dreams, but they absurd, and they obscene
Pregnant on TV at sixteen
Don't know what this shit means
Yo, can't trust these no-good, two-faced cut-throat paigons living in Babylon
Wanna sell me lies, wanna bleed me dry, wanna see me live like a vagabond
Like I worked this hard and I come this far just to them waffle and babble on
Don't want your help, don't need your advice who rattled your cage
Know one of these days won't cease to amaze
Bunch of lost souls they ain't tryna get saved
They're just tryna get paid, wanna jump on my wave
Turn back around, jump right in my grave
Do me a favour, don't do me no favours
I don't need no saviour cause I do it major
Now it's back to the paper I'll deal with the paigons later9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Everybody wants to be famous
Nobody wants to be nameless, aimless
People act shameless, tryna live like entertainers
Want a fat crib with the acres
So they spend money that they ain’t made yet
Got a Benz on tik that they ain’t paid yet
Spend their pay cheque in the West End on the weekend
Got no money by the end of the weekend
But they don’t care 'cause their life is a movie
Starring Louis V, paid for by yours truly
Truthfully, it’s a joke, like a bad episode of Hollyoaks
Can’t keep up with the cover notes
So they got bad credit, livin’ on direct debit in debt
They still don’t get it
'Cause they too busy livin’ the high life, the night life
Huggin’ the high when livin’ it large and they all say

Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do (That's right)
Now and then it seems that life is just too much
But you’ve got the love I need to see me through

Check it, yo, let me take you down to London city
Where the attitude’s bad and the weather is–
Everybody’s on a paper chase, it’s one big rat race
Everybody's got a screw face, so many two-face
Checkin' their high just like they're ready to ride
I’m on the inside looking at the–
So it’s an accurate reflection
City wide, north, east, west and the south side
Everywhere, I go there’s a goon on the corner
Guns and drugs 'cause the city’s like a sauna
And it’s getting warmer, and out of order
Tryna put a struggling mother to a mourner
Mr. Politician, can you tell me the solution?
What’s the answer? What’s the conclusion?
Is it an illusion? Is it a mirage?
I see youngens die because they tryna live large
And they all say
Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
(Put your hands up)
I know I can count on all of you (That's right, that's right)
Sometimes I feel like saying, “Lord I just don’t care” (Woah)
But you’ve got the love I need to see me through
(Check it, check it, come on, come on)
You got the love (Who’s got the love?)
You got the love (Who’s got the love?)
You got the love (That’s right, that's right, that's right, that's right)
You got the love (Who’s got the love?)
You got the love (Who’s got the love?)
You got the love (Check it, yo)

Yo, we're living in the days of the credit crunch
Give me the dough, I’m tryna have a bunch
But I can't have rice for lunch
It's not there, ain't enough to share
It ain't fair, never dreamed that he could be rare
Who cares, who dares to make a change?
Everybody's in the club trying to make it rain
But not for famine, just for the sake of having
15 minutes of fame and everywhere’s the same
Again and again, I see the same thing
Everybody acting like they their plane sailin’
But I see rough seas ahead, maybe a recession
And then a depression in whatever profession
This is my confession, I can’t front, I’m in the forefront
Living for money, ready to start like a bungee jump
With no rope, but I ain’t tryna see the bottom
Because that's where I came from, I ain’t forgotten
You got the love (Who’s got the love?)
You got the love
You got the love (That’s right, that's right, that's right, that's right, and again)
You got the love (C'mon, c'mon)
You got the love (Woahhhh)
You got the love (Woo!)
Who’s got the love? Who's got the love?
Who's got the love? Come on
And again, c'mon
Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on all of you
Sometimes I feel like saying, “Lord I just don’t care"
But you’ve got the love I need to see me through2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Don't stop, don't stop, til it's hurting
Come on, don't stop don't stop, til you're bleeding, alright

Got a screwface all night, all day
Screwface keeps breddas at bay
Screwface means keep well away, stay away
Screwface means get out my way
Screwface means you don't know me
What you looking at? What's your beef?
Screwface means I'm not having it
Screwface means I'm not a chief
Screwface means I'm not happy right now
That's why no smile was used
Screwface means I'm not pleased
Screwface means I'm not amused
Screwface means I just wanna walk, not talk
Screwface means I just wanna leave
When I activate my screwface, give me space
Screwface means let me breathe
I got sick flows, make an MC have to walk on his tip-toes
Life ain't always nice, that's how shit goes
And you know we're going on black 'cause we're blick rows
And I can't be seen with these sick hoes
Where did I stay last night? I think your chick knows
We were knock-knocking the boots and we kicked toes
Your girl's the same as all bimbos, freaks and nymphos
I've got an idea, make dough on the spot, I mean right here
Nike Air, got paper for the whole year
You can bring drama 'cause I got no fear
And my head feels so clear
Move to the mic, MCs are like "oh dear"
Some try catching me up but they're not near
Not ever, not now and not here, way too hot here
(
Oi, rudeboy
Oi, , next riddim, next riddim, next riddim, next riddim, next riddim)
Look, look, girls, ladies, do the butterfly
Shake your batty low, shake your batty high
Don't ask me who, where, when or why
Wanna see your batty rise high to the sky
Girls, ladies, do the butterfly
Shake your batty low, shake your batty high
Don't ask me who, where, when or why
Wanna see your batty rise high to the sky3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww, shhhhhit
Yeah, yeah
Raskit and Skepta
Yutes in the end tryna get that cash
Yeah, goin' on dirty, goin' on stank

You throw a penny up the wall, pick the money up off the floor
You drip it, you flip it, tell the plug you need some more
Second time tonight, tell him you need a better price
He said the weight is heavy, tell him you need the exercise
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right (greaze)
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right

Hey, stop that, start that, get that (what?)
No, we ain't ducking no get back, it's Rascal and Skeppy
With something peppery for your headback
Ain't no disrespect better dead that
Come through stuntin' in somethin' all jet black
Mandem hustlin', crumblin', rollin' and bunnin' that jetpack
Stumblin, lungs are lookin' all jet black
Old school east side brother I rep that
You go check that you'll get your neck snapped
All of them setbacks
Kept me on the tip of my creps and I can't forget that
Forget my cheque and you will regret that
I get the cheque and they can't affect that
You better check that, this all correct up get that cheque back and I'll protect that
You throw a penny up the wall, pick the money up off the floor
You drip it, you flip it, tell the plug you need some more
Second time tonight, tell him you need a better price
He said the weight is heavy, tell him you need the exercise
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right (greaze)
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right

Go on then, go on then, we don't play (nah)
It's Skeppy and Raskit back with a brand new track yeah the London wave (smoke)
Everyday man follow me surfin' online tryna catch the wave (the wave)
Get baptised, make your whole crew capsize
Been bullying crews for days (greaze)
Tell that pussyhole stop talking rubbish
Man came in with the thuggish ruggish (greaze)
You cannot talk about the roads to a guy that's fuckin' done it (done it, done it)
Yeah, running around the street with a bally for the money
Baby fathers got the yutes with the swammy in the buggy (woah)

I'm the alpha omega, please, take what's older I slay you freeze
Lay you out where you stay that's greaze
I don't ramp I don't play and I do not bend
And I do not sway with ease, they can't sway me away from Ps
I want all of the smoke I'm wheezy and I smoked about 1000 trees
Breathe easy you know my steez, E3 and Meridian Gs
Way I move so ghost I'm local but I'm thinkin' I'm overseas
Trying to seize some vitamin D, dotting the Is and crossing the Ts
You're a joker you can't be serious if you say you aren't from my trees
You throw a penny up the wall, pick the money up off the floor
You drip it, you flip it, tell the plug you need some more
Second time tonight, tell him you need a better price
He said the weight is heavy, tell him you need the exercise
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right

Ha-ha, just like that
They never saw it coming
We don't talk for the sake of talkin', we just get it done
Yutes in the ends, tryna get that cash
East, North, South, West, big up your chest
Goin' on dirty, goin' on stank2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Close, close, wanna get close on the coast
Ghost, ghost don’t pose and I don’t post
Close, close, wanna get close on the coast
Ghost, ghost

Pickin' me a winner
Picky hair an’ I was a little bit thinner
3310 with a customised ringer
I was tryna holla at Lavinia but she weren’t ina
Cos I was a sinner, thought I was a minger
Never had a Bimmer
Rollin’ through the ends on a stolen aprillia
Waiting for the Dominos guy to deliver for a free dinner
Thought I knew it all I was just a beginner, never was a singer
I was on pirate radio way before I heard Mike Skinner
Wagwan killer, yeah, that’s my nigga
Talk about race but its just way bigger
I ain't gonna waste no time on Twitter
Done with the jibba, cry me a river
Say it to my face or say it to my trigger
You go figure, or reconsider, Indian giver
Lookin’ for a chocolate girl with a hint of vanilla
And she can bring a Indian with her
I just want a bosom for a pillow
An’ I got a little bit o skrilla
We can get a boat and we can get a villa
Or we can be on South Beach ruining your liver
All killer, no filler
I don’t wanna brag or boast
I don’t cater and I don’t host
When they ask what I do I say I do the most
Then I get ghost, on the coast like I am supposed
Don’t pose and I do not post
And that’s why these girls wanna play me

Close, close, wanna get close on the coast
Ghost, ghost don’t pose and I don’t post
Close, close, wanna get close on the coast
Ghost, ghost

They ain't put food on my table, I rock the cradle
Big dirty stinkin’ logo I rock the label
I’ve been doin’ this since cable
I was on the graveyard shift in the studio
Only popped out for a salt beef bagel
I was on the roads when it was unstable
I’m not an angel, beef had more than a plate full
But I ain’t hateful, born in the 80s, year of the 8 ball
Come back 18, could've been a facial, would've been painful
Raised in the 90s, it was still racial, bloody disgraceful
Why are these yutes so bloody ungrateful
Talk about grime like I ain’t a staple
I was on the mic when you was in play-school
Stabbed six times yo it could have been fateful
Would have been 6 foot deep
On my bredrin’s T-shirt lookin’ distasteful
Would have been wasteful
Never would have seen the Caribbean in April
Shackin’ up with Rachel, givin’ her a face-full
Never would have been seven figures deep
Walkin’ down the street with a gorgeous freak in a chief
Screamin’ "come out the way fool"
I don’t wanna brag or boast
I don’t cater and I don’t host
When they ask what I do I say I do the most
Then I get ghost, on the coast like I am supposed
Don’t pose and I do not post
And that’s why these girls wanna play me

Close, close, wanna get close on the coast
Ghost, ghost don’t pose and I don’t post
Close, close, wanna get close on the coast
Ghost, ghostEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Rude boy, don't watch that
Cause if it's armshouse I'll rock that
And if it's on top you know I got that
Come through with a big baseball bat
Like blud, don't make me get old school
Blud, don't make me get old school
Blud, don't make me get old school
Blud, don't make me get old school

Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him
Why you rolling with that pussyhole
Moving with that pussyhole
You know that he's a pussyhole
I showed you he's a pussyhole
He's always been a pussyhole
So he will always be a pussyhole
You're still with that pussyhole
You must be a pussyhole
As the bredda always chatting like he's strong
Sneaky fake fuck always running to his brother when it's on
Hardly backs the beef, last one swinging
First one running making them stories he's a chief
Bringing breddas to the ends, acting up
Putting on a show trying to talk funny to his friends
But his really not a don they know it
And you know it, something must be seriously wrong
Cause your parring, his mum calls you darling
But his brothers got you shotting
And we know where you're stopping
I heard you both have beef with an older breh
You took a spark and he just stood there
Now that boys a pussyhole say it ain't true
It started because of him and ended with you
And it's that kind of shit that's gonna continue
But I guess it don't matter if that's what you're into
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him
Why you rolling with that pussyhole
Moving with that pussyhole
You know that he's a pussyhole
I showed you he's a pussyhole
He's always been a pussyhole
So he will always be a pussyhole
You're still with that pussyhole
You must be a pussyhole

The Sun's the biggest star in the sky
But naturally its gotta make room for the moon every night
Every friend got his time limit
Even relationships
Everything's sunny when the friendships tight
A friend in need is a friend indeed
But a friend with no money and no weed
Could flip the script at a ridiculous speed
And make a best friend and ex friend for the P
A couple years ago in my road youth days
I was into pirate radio I guess it was a phase
There was this one particular MC man
He was an older in my ends and I thought he was the dan
So I started rolling with him kind of like a little brother
My cousin used to say he was a pussy undercover
I didn't think that it was nothing more than jealousy
But I wish I woulda listened every time he told me
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him
Why you rolling with that pussyhole
Moving with that pussyhole
You know that he's a pussyhole
I showed you he's a pussyhole
He's always been a pussyhole
So he will always be a pussyhole
You're still with that pussyhole
You must be a pussyhole
Pussyhole, Pussyhole
Pussyhole, Pussyhole

Stay away from those pussyholes, you can have it all
Live endlessly tremendous forever ball
Stand up for something or for anything you'll fall
But definitely know when not to lose your cool
Cause it ain't what you show, it's what your concealing
Put a smile on the deepest negative feeling
Stand tall even when their hating and their scheming
Then watch your money rise right to the ceiling
Stand tall even when their hating and their scheming
Yea watch your money rise right to the ceiling
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He's a pussyhole, he's a chief leave him
Stop rolling with that bredda, you don't need him
He ain't got your back if it's beef leave him
Why you rolling with that pussyhole
Moving with that pussyhole
You know that he's a pussyhole
I showed you he's a pussyhole
He's always been a pussyhole
So he will always be a pussyhole
You're still with that pussyhole
You must be a pussyholeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I will fight till I take my last breath
I got the heart of a warrior
The heart of a warrior
I’ve been down, I’ve been out and I bled
I got the heart of a warrior
The heart of a warrior
I’ll never back down

Born fearless, leavin when it’s delirious
Superstar and super serious
Runnin the game like I was born gearless
Deeper guy, I got the beat to live em earless
Still I know that they still hear us
Only rap, we make an appearance
So I shout, shout, let it out
Remain tearless ‘cause I’m careless
Doing it for the man dem in the hoodies and the new eras
Young ragamuffin, can't tell me nothing
Miss me with that huff and puffing
You ain't ready to buck and get stuck in
You're just doing a lot of chuckin
I’m just doing a lot of talkin'
Are you sick or something?
Are you thick or something?
You should think of ducking
Hit you with that nunchukka
I Bruce Lee your fly kick
Jump up and Tom pop and I’ve got something
Nigga they comin hard for they food
Don’t wanna see me switch and lose my cool
‘Cause I be up with that fool, hard but you have to smooth, I be actin a fool
I be actin a fool… I be actin a fool… I be actin a fool… I be actin a fool…

When the bumper clean shake the earth right underneath
Pick up the devil sides and let them call me thunder feet
If you want a war I’m not the one to meet, I’m not sure I’m the sweet
I’m like a tropic in the summer, come with heat
Not to blow my own brass but I’m having a blast
Spendin my paper fast
Think I’m movin around, start havin a laugh
Competition’s lookin over bars and I’m last nice
Be fragile, reppin the underclass
Miss me with your problems cuz I can’t be yours
Who Jeremy call, I look at the wall
You star, we size em all
You like to profile, you just a child that’s in denial
Now you’re on trial
You should bring the mind with me while we’re flexin
Good with nothing but a swagger and the crooked fall
Hentai but never get rinced out cuz I stay fresh out
No doubt, don’t say no
I’m giving a proper, keep a pitch out
I’m sittin here, I don’t think about her
I’m black tie, I’m tweeted up
It’s amazing what you can when you put your finger up

Now now I was way through the fire
Yea yea I got the eye of the tiger
So tell me, what’s gonna stop me now
God knows that I put in the hours
I can’t lose now, I got the power
We at the top blowin smoke in the sky
But I’mma take it just a little bit higher
