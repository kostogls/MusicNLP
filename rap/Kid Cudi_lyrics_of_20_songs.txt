I'm just what you made God — not many I trust
I'ma go my own way God, take my fate to wherever you want
I'm out here, on my son, won't stop 'til I get me some
Club-hoppin', tryna get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung
Early in the morning, I'm wakin', bakin', drinkin', contemplatin'
Ain't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it
Thank the Lord for that burning bush
That big body Benz I was born to push
On my way I'm burning kush, nigga don't be worried 'bout us
Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down
I say, "Ain't no music on", she said, "No, that weed is loud"
Nigga, we ballin', straight swaggin', lost Hawk, but I'm maintainin'
I've been told that I'm amazing, make sure keep that fire blazin', we livin'

I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I'm just what you made God, just what you made God (Nee-need it)
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made
(Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God

Let me tell you ‘bout my month y'all, in the shop and I had a ball
I had to ball for therapy, my shrink don’t think that helps at all
Whatever, that man ain’t wearing these leather pants
I diagnose my damn self, these damn pills ain’t working fam
I- In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
I know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life you’d understand
But, I can’t fold, some poor soul got it way worse
We’re all troubled, in a world in trouble
It’s scary to have a kid walk this Earth
I’m what you made God, fuck yes I’m so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren’t my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
Everyday to find sane’s a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors

I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I'm just what you made God, just what you made God (Nee-need it)
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made
(Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God

Need it to get by, ya

Hey...
Ratatat, yeah!
Na-na-na-nah
Na-na-na-nah

Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit, feelin' right, 2 AM, summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel
Driving drunk, I'm doing my thing
Rolling the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out "Fuck that"
I'ma do just what I want, looking ahead, no turning back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
Tell me what you know about dreamin', dreamin'?
You don't really know about nothin', nothin'
Tell me what you know about the night terrors every night
5 AM, cold sweats, waking up to the sky
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow

I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

Slow mo'
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive though he is feeling blue
The sun is shining, man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away, he slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of, to free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night

I got 99 problems and they all bitches
Wish I was Jigga man, carefree livin'
But I'm not Shawn or Martin Louis
I'm that Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys
You knowin' how it be when you start living large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it, Mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself
"Why he by himself?"
He got two older brothers; one hood, one good
An independent older sister kept me fly when she could
But they all didn't see
The little bit of sadness in me
Scotty

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe
I try and think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room
And soon I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time, nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancún
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right, I try and shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand, fam
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

I'm this close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending would be slittin' my throat
Ignorance to cope, man, ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love and I need that shit
If I never did shows then I'd prolly be a myth
If I cared about the blogs then I'd prolly be a jackass
Don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout, fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see 30
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down; pussy, and some Cali tree
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life
To my life, to my life, to my life...

Plain Pat, what up?

My heart thump
Not from being nervous
Sometimes I'm thinking God
Made me special here on purpose
So all the while, 'til I'm gone
Make my words important
So if I slip away, if I die today
The last thing you remember won't be
About some apple bottom jeans
With the boots with the fur
Maybe how I dream of being free since my birth
Cursed, but the demons I confronted would disperse
Have you ever heard of some shit so real
Beyond, from the heart, from the soul, you can feel

And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral
My mind runs
I could never catch it
Even if I got a head start
God please help me
I am feeling so alone, wait
I don't need to worry
'Cause I know the world'll feel this, nigga
Blessing in disguise, but
I am not hiding who I am, open your eyes, bruh
If I ever met you, I appreciate the love, yo
Girls that I dated, it's okay, I am not mad, yo
Unless you stabbed me in the heart, no love ho
The shit is so ill
Play it back from the top if you recognize real

And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral
I'm ready for that
I'm ready for the funeral, hey-hey
I'm ready for the funeral, hey
I'm ready for the funeral
Hey, I'm ready for it
I'm ready for it
I'm ready for the funeral145EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She said I don't spend time like I really should
She said she don't know me anymore
I think she hates me deep down, I know she does
She wants to erase me, hmm
A couple days, no talking, I see my baby
And this what she tells me

She said I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you (Yeah)

It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete (Yeah)
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete (Hmm)
A couple weeks, no talking, I see my baby
I missed you so damn much
Hey, I wish we could start over, I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me

She said I keep on running, keep on running, and nothing works
I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you
Yeah, cause I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you are, you might hear me (Uh)
I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you go, you might see me (Hello, haha)

Uh, I'm Yeezy, she say "Hi, I'm Aria"
No, you a angel, you wave "Hi" to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea, they built a new arena
Why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
I know I seen you before, but don't know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now, you something that I dreamed of
Don C says she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinsky on the dress, she'll take you to the cleaners
Sure enough, a week later, I'm in extra love
And everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a en-a
She let it go to her head, "No, not my Aria"
The height of her shopping was writer's blocking me
I couldn't get my shit out anyway, I hope you die, Aria

I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you87EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(Yawn)
Alright, run it
I never gave a fuck
I never gave a fuck about what niggas thought about me
I mean, I did, but like, fuck it, you know what I'm saying?
You gon' love me, man
You gon' love me, man

They can't comprehend
Or even come close to understanding him
I guess if I was boring they would love me more
Guess if I was simple in the mind, everything would be fine
Maybe if I was a jerk to girls
Instead of being nice and speaking kind words
Then maybe it would be okay to say then
I wasn't a good guy to begin with

But my mind is all crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like an airplane in the sky
But then they say I'm crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like a bird sitting high, high
I be that man on the moon, I'm that man on the moon
And I'mma do what I do, so do you, hey-hey
I be posted with my blunt and a brew, my dude
I'm that man on the moon, I'm up-up on the moon

It's like, I'mma play all my stuff for everybody
And you know, and all my people they give me feedback
You know, and they'll be like
"Yo, yo, why, why your shit sound so different?"
You know what I'm saying?
"Why your shit, like on another level-Why's, why's it sound so different?"
Like that's a bad thing
And I be like
"Why not, nigga?"

Close my eyes, high in the dark
It's a curtain call; come one, come all
All I do is try to make it simple
The ones that make it complicated
Never get congratulated
I'm something different, all aspects
Don't want a woman just to love her assets
I'll still wife her up, even with her flat chest
The type to get hurt, but that's the past tense
My mind is all hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy
I be thinkin' that I'm wrong
'Cause they used to call me lame, lame, lame, lame
My swag was a little different
But then my mind is hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy
I be thinkin' that I'm wrong
But they the ones who lame, lame, lame, lame
I got the last laugh, nigga

I be that man on the moon, I'm that man on the moon
And I'mma do what I do, so do you, hey-hey

Nightmares kept a nigga from closin' his lids (Lids)
Since a kid, I've been haunted by visions of death
Such a trip, now it's normal, I customed the grip
Think they gone, nah, they just dormant, the hauntings ain't left
Now tell me what's a young nigga to do
When the zombies are comin' for you?
Load up them Daryl Dixons
Survived the rage, turn the page, relaxin', I'm whippin'
Last week, I almost weaved right off of Mulholland
Chiefin' good like I should, alone in my thoughts
All the awesome places I've gone to and witnessed
Is it worth the paranoia, betrayal, or loss?
Nah, nah, heroes can't simply have it all
Sacrifice, but see heroes don't sleep, we hear the call
My nieces know Uncle Scottie's so rock and roll
My princess Vada know rock and roll, Daddy got the glow
Got some pride in your town, I'm spottin' 'em lately

Not this, my nigga, you be here (Be here)
Not this, my nigga, you ain't here (Ain't here)
Big boss, I made your heart heavy (Uh-uh)
Can't stop me, can't carry me, baby

Life ain't easy sober, we live so geeky (Yeah)

I am the smartest man alive!

I tried to tell all my friends when I was a kid that I had powers
And nobody wanted to believe me
All right

Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm

Spent the last month feeling bad 'bout myself
I couldn't speak anything of real hope
And the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins
A sudden change in my groove, in my walk
Hmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
It's like the city is mine and the dark is my cape
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope

I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said, "Tonight I feel immortal," ohh
Tonight I feel immortal, woah
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm

Bet you want to see me weak, not sort of my thing you see
I'm too damn cool, my mojo too dope
It's the same old thing getting lost day and night, young and lost in the pain
So many times I've broke this vicious cycle
Hmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
Surely I'ma do what I want, ain't got no one to blame
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope

I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal, ohh
Tonight I feel immortal, yeah

Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm

I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal, ohh
Tonight I feel immortal, yeah-ah
Ohh, I, ohh

Askin' God to help 'em, are you hearin' me?
Girl is tellin' me she don't know what she want
Lotta demons creepin' up, they're livin' underneath
Gotta take a minute, y'all, traveled far

It's the shit I need

Tryna find it on the right track
Oh, wanna be just where the free at
Hm, talk to Him, He don't speak back
Hm, can't losе, I'm in the third act

Just me, the universe, and everything I think
Lotta shit is weighin' on me, it's a storm
Never thought I would be back here bleeding
I'm not just some sad dude
You can see my life, how I grew, I want serenity

Tryna find it on the right track
Oh, wanna be just where the free at
Talk to Him, He don't speak back
Hm, can't lose, I'm in the third act

God, I thought I loved you so
God, I thought I loved you so

They done let in the skinny jean-wearing
Fro-for-days in a old AA
Ball' so low, most fools couldn't price me
Silently stunt with a blunt full of P.E.
And I guess you know me
Been in NY so long, got Tri-State family
Especially Brooklyn—shout-out to the Madis
My bloodline runs deep
Nights, I don’t sleep
Figure it’s my pops keeping me awake
Help me keep my mind out the clouds for reality
These motherfuckers can’t fathom the wizardry
Slow-mo-brain, ass-backwards cowards
Take a shower, your attitude stinks

Give a fuck about a motherfucker lifestyle, 'cause, nigga, hey
I live through words, not metaphors
So I passed to be the rest of the freshmen
Playful tough talk, often the fave
'Til I came like 'Pac art and said true things
A whole new legion of some niggas
Aiming high, past the idea of slanging
Praise Allah for keeping me away, man
Lotta of my niggas fell victim to the dope game
Somethings will never be the same
Wish that I could tell my brother
Something for some motivation to get him out that gutter
He’s leaving behind a family and a mother
Damn, you must understand
What I speak about in song, this how I really am
Yeah, this is how I really think
You can see what I see, yes, I really blink
Yes, I really drink, I really do rage
My demons out the cage 'bout most of the day
Before I became the age to even rage
I was drowning my sorrows with some O.E., nigga

I am happy to be alive
'Cause I know I could not be in a place that's filled with lies
Can't stand no quiet nights, while I fill up my glass with pride
Hopeful is all I know, how to keep me from silent cries
Nothing I can say, facing all this pain in my way

I fight it every day

Yeah, woah-woah, oh
Yeah, woah-woah, haha
Yeah
My name is Scott Mescudi, yeah
Yeah

Gotta get it through my thick head
I was so close to being dead, yeah
Life, live it, with nobody's help tips
Man, I'm just walking without being led
See the world is so crazy and filled with such risk and man
I just know I gotta dodge them, yeah
The beginning is always followed by an end
In the in-between time I'm not runnin' or hidin'

See things do come around
And make sense eventually
Things do come around
But some things trouble me

The people I've met and the places I've been
Are all what make me the man I so proudly am
But I wanna know one thing
When did I become a ghost?
I'm most confused about the world I live in
You think that I'm lonely, well I probably am
One thing that still gets me
When did I become a ghost?
Yeah
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, woah-woah, haha, yay
Yeah, whoa, whoa-whoa, yoo

Tried to fight it, but soon that gave in
Went down a road with no lights on
Can't describe it, and you don't move like them
You become their worst nightmare
You remember the things that your parents had said and well
Rather find out the hard way
You should tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend
I keep with my stroll, I'm not runnin' or hidin'

See things do come around
And make sense eventually
Things do come around
But some things still trouble me

The people I've met and the places I've been

Oh, since I was young, been grooving to my own drum

Stronger than I know, soon I'd understand
The power I possess, the story of the Chosen

Oh, where them friends now? I don't see 'em
And if I do, I don't sense the truth in 'em
Distancing myself while I'm focusing, fo-focusing
Don't pretend to worry bout shit
Go through one ear and out the other
Better off saying nothing, nigga
As I shine on and dream on, our vibes are on
Had one trip of a dream back in 2003
Who am I? And who will I be? Will I be free?
I need a sign, oh I need a sign

(They must be delusional) to think they fucking with me, though
I put that on my soul, can't love, they jealous, so jealous, and some
Learning day to day, humans
Spread love to all my sisters and brothers, let's do better
Stop judging a nigga because they're different
We're supposed to groove to our own tune
So woke from that one tripped out dream back in 2003
(Oh, who am I?)
And who do I see, baby?
The stars will align, the stars will align

Electro body, known to blow fuses

Soarin', is this allowed?
I sure bet my daddy proud
A little nigga with a Shaker smile
On top of the dreams is where I'm found
Some figured I was Satan bound
Until I came back with a style I found
Then all of a sudden they fixed their faces
'Cause of who I know and the trail of places
That I've stepped
How many niggas wanna hate 'cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack?
'Cause I'm risking my soul intact, now I'm heard all over the map
Only rule of thumb
It don't really matter just where you from
All that really matter is where you gon' go
Maybe upstate for some
But you can’t rule out these cats for gone
Second chances given out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage
Then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
Done pimpin', you can think about marriage, until then, get it
Then find yourself and let's begin
I'ma tell you how in a minute
I'ma show you how I be livin'
From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid
Now I'm zoned, see things so vivid
Hide my soul? Nah, homie, not even
I'ma zone out 'til I lose feeling, remember
I'ma be gone way past November
Even, stay up there, up there
Floatin', floatin', hopin'
I can find peace somewhere
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all

Ballin', is this allowed?
Without feelin' like Shallow Hal
Diamonds on the Jesus piece for style
Back in Cleveland City we ride around
Greetin' my niggas with dap and pound
So if I fall, I won't hit the ground
These are the things that'll make me smile
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while
I keep myself so lifted
I am accustomed to new heights
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless
See without my flight, man
Everybody wanna be a critic
I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
Ha, my jokes, they will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
More than likely I am faded, man
You are not the shit if everywhere you go
Niggas ain't sitting, standing 'round hating, so
My vice is when the lights start flashin'
I'll be zonin', all alone then
And the place where my mind is goin'
Filled with songs that no one's knowin'
And the Devil in a hot pink dress
Tryna ask me for one dance
He think he slick
But my guardians protect me from his wrath
So, in my place no hate shall enter
Livin' high up there, up there
Copin', copin', floatin'
I will find peace somewhere
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all


In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all81EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
