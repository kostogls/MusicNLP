Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

(Ah!) Yooo! (Yeah! Yeah!)
This is Wyclef, Refugee Camp (L-Boogie up in here)
Pra'zrel, (Pra'zrel up in here! Ha! Ha!)
Lil' Base sits up there on the base (Refugees up in here)
While I'm on this... I got my girl L (Ah, ah)
One time (One time), one time, (One time)
Ayo, L, you know you got the lyrics

I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
And listen for a while
And there he was
This young boy, stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers (One time, one time)
Singing my life with his words (Two times, two times)
Killing me softly with this song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
Then read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers (One time, one time)
Singing my life with his words (Two times, two times)
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

Yo, L-Boog, take me to the bridge

Woah
Woah-oah-ah-ah-ah uh, uh
La-la-la, la, la, la
Woah, la
Woah, la (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Laaaa
Strumming my pain with his fingers (Yes, he was singing)
Yes he was singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Strumming my pain, yeah (Strumming my pain)

Yo, put your hands together for L-Boogie from the Refugee Camp (Yeah, yeah)
(Singing my life)
Up in here, you know how we do, L-Boogie up in here
Wyclef, Pra'zrel, said L-Boogie up in here
Wyclef up in here
My man Lil' Base (Pra'zrel up in here)
Jerry one time (T Rocks up in here, we got Warren up in here)
This is how we— (Warren up, up in here, Outsiders up here)
Refugee Camp, Refugee Camp (We got Fallon up in here, Mulaney, Mulaney's up in here, we got Val' up in here)

Everybody got a breaking point, kid, and they'll rat on you
The family niggas'll rat on you
That's why we gotta be prepared to take out whoever we need to (Man, motherfucker, I told you I was gonna get you next)67EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me (Yo)

Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake (Yeah)
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates, those who fake, they break
When they meet their four hundred-pound mate
If I could rule the world (If I ruled the world), everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto. of course, when giddy-upping on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete for the deceased
But, no, don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinking 'bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me (Yo, yo, yo, yo)
I play my enemies like a game of chess
Where I rest, no stress if you don't smoke sess
Lest I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Gore-Tex and sweats, I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're doo-doo
Voodoo, I can do what you do, easy
Believe me, fronting niggas give me heebie-jeebies (Ha)
So while you imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone and defecating on your microphone

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
You can't run away from these scars I got, oh, baby
Hey, baby, ‘cause I got a lot, oh, yeah
And anywhere you go, my whole crew gonna know, oh, baby
Hey, baby, you can't hide from the block, oh, no

Ready or not, refugees taking over
The Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber (Drop bombs)
Crews run for cover, now they're under, pushing up flowers
Superfly, true lies, do or die (He's super fly)
Toss me high, only puff lye with my crew from Lakay
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay (Yes, sir)
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (Ayo, nobody move)
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide (Ayo, nobody move)
Gonna find you and make you want me (Come on)
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (You know the—)
Gonna find you and take it slowly (You know)
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me65EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We used to be number 10, now we're permanent at one
In the battle lost my finger, mic became my arm
Pistol nozzle hits your nasal, blood becomes lukewarm
Tell the woman be easy, nah squeeze the Charmin
Test Wyclef, see death flesh get scorned
Beat you so bad make you feel like you ain't wanna be born, Jean
And tell your friends stay the hell out of my lawn
Chicken George become Dead George
Stealin' chickens from my farm
Damn, another dead pigeon
If you're mafiosos then I'm bringin' on Haitian Sicilians
Nobody's shootin', my body's made of hand grenade
Girl bled to death while she was tongue-kissin' a razor blade
That sounds sick, maybe one day I'll write a horror
Blackula comes to the ghetto (Stick 'em up), jacks an Acura
Stevie Wonder sees crack babies
Becomin' enemies of their own families

Armageddon come, you know-a we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Tryin' to front like you're down with Mount Zion

Ooh, la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doin' our thing
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the natural la that the Refugees bring
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing
(She love me like she never before, ayy)
Yeah, in saloons we drink Boone's and battle goons 'til high noon
Bust rap tunes on flat spoons, take no shorts like poom poom's
See hoochies pop coochies for Gucci's and loochies
Find me in my Mitsubishi, eatin' sushi, bumpin' Fugees
Hey, hey, hey, try to take the crew and we don't play play
Say, say, say, like Paul McCartney, not hardly
Oddly enough, I can see right through your bluff
Niggas huff and they puff but they can't handle us, we bust
'Cause we fortified, I could never hide
Seen "Cooley High", cried when Cochise died
I'm twisted, blacklisted by some other negroes
Don't remove my Polos on the first episode
Ha-ha-ha-ha, you shouldn't diss refugees, and
Ha-ha-ha-ha, you whole sound set booty, and
Ha-ha-ha-ha, you have to respect Jersey
'Cause I'm superfly when I'm super-high
On the Fu-Gee-La

Ooh, la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doin' our thang
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the natural LA that the Refugees Bring
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing
(She love me like she never before, ayy)
I sit 90 degrees underneath palm trees
Smokin' Beedi as I burn my calories
Brooklyn roof tops become Brooklyn tee-pees
Who that be? Enemy, wanna see the death of me
From Hawaii to Hawthorne, I run marathons, like
Buju Banton, I'm a true champion, like
Farrakhan reads his daily Qur'an
It's a phenomenon, lyrics fast like Ramadan

What's goin' on? Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Tryin' to front like you're down with Mount Zion
What's goin' on? Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Tryin' to front like you're down with Mount Zion

Yo kid, we gotta get our family together, man

Pick up your microphones, ha-ha
Pick up your microphones, yo

How many mics do we rip on the daily?
Say, me say many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do we rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many
I get mad frustrated when I rhyme
Thinkin' of all them kids that try to do this for all the wrong reasons
Seasons change, mad things rearrange
But it all stays the same like the love doctor, strange
I'm tame like the rapper, get red like a snapper when they do that
Got your whole block saying "True dat"
If only they knew that it was you who was irregular
Sold your soul for some secular muzak that's wack
Plus you use that loop over and over
Claiming that you got a new style, your attempts are futile
Ooh, child, you puerile, brain waves are sterile
You can't create, you just wait to take my tapes (Bing)
Laced with malice, hands get calloused
From gripping microphones from here to Dallas
Go ask Alice if you don't believe me, I get in her visions like Stevie
See me ascend from the chalice like the weed be
Indeed we like Khalid Muhammad, MCs make me vomit
I get controversial, freak your style with no rehearsal
Au contraire mon frère, don't you even go there
Me without a mic is like a beat without a snare
I dare to tear into your ego
We go way back like some ganja and pelequo
Or ColecoVision, my rhymes make incisions in your anatomy
And I'll back this with Deuteronomy
Or Leviticus, God made this word, you can't get with this
Sweet like licorice, dangerous like syphilis, yeah
How many mics do we rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do I rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do you rip on the daily?

How many mics do we rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many

I used to be underrated, now I take iron
Makes my shit constipated, I'm more concentrated
So on my day off, with David Sonenberg I play golf
Run through Crown Heights screaming out, "Mazel tov!"
Problem with no man, before Black, I'm first human
Appetite to write like Frederick Douglass with a slave hand (Bing)
Street pressure, word to papa, I ain't goin' under
One day I'll have a label and make deals with Tommy Mottola
Mama always told me, "You're one in a million"
Always watch your back, never tangle with Haitian Sicilians
Now I got a record deal, "How does it feel?"
I'm never gonna survive unless I get crazy like Seal
'Cause the whole world's out of order
So at night, the fiends dance on grease with John Travolta
One got slaughtered as he coughed blood from his mouth
The other tried to duck and caught a left with my Guinness Stout
Brother, brother, can't you get this through your head?
This is set up by the feds, they're scoping us with their infrareds
How many mics do you rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do I rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do we rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many

Too many MCs, not enough mics
Exit your show like I exit the turnpike
Dice and dynamite like Dolemite
Double-deuce delight, I don't Dick Van Dyke
Star light to star bright, the freaks come out at night
Like my man Wyclef (I wear my sunglasses at night)
And my panache will mosh your entourage
Squash the squad and hide their bodies under my garage
And when the cops come lookin, I be bookin' to Brooklyn
Leave the trails broken, flippin' tokens to Hoboken
A clean getaway like Alec Baldwin
Driving in my fast car playing Tracy Chapman

How many mics do we rip on the daily?
Say, me say many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do you rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do we rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do I rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many
Many, many, money, many, many, many
Many, many, money, many, many, many

Yo, as I was sayin', look
Yo, yo, hold up kid, hol' up, hol' up (Yo, man)
Yo, ready or not, kid (Yo, yo, I gotta tell you somethin', man)
They gon' move on us (If they do, but, yo)
And we gotta get prepared
We gotta get the forces together, man (I gotta do what I gotta do, man)
We gotta get our family together (I'ma haul ass down to Mexico, yo)
Ready or not, man (Word is born)
Ready or not they gon' move on us
So I tell you what, better safe than sorry
Let's be ready21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

One, two, I'm bout to set this off!
Like this, hip-hoppers, check it

Another MC lose his life tonight, Lord
I beg that you pray to Jesus Christ, why
Oh Lord, father don't let him bury me, woah

I haunt MCs like Mephistopheles, bringing swords of Damocles
Secret service keep a close watch as if my name was Kennedy
Abstract raps simple with a street format
Gaze into the sky and measure planets by parallax
Check out the retrograde motion, kill the notion
Of biting and recycling and calling it your own creation
I feel like Rockwell, somebody's watching me
I got no privacy whether on land or at sea
And for you biting zealots, your raps are cacophonic
Hypocrite, critic, but deep inside you wish you had the pop hit
It hurts, don't it?
A refugee come to your turf, and take over the earth
See, my rhymes are the type of fly rhymes
That can only get down with my crew
And if you try, to take lines or bite rhymes
We'll show you how The Refugees do
Yeah, yeah behold, as my odes, manifold on your rhymes
Two MCs can't occupy the same space at the same time
It's against the laws of physics
So weep as your sweet dreams break up like Eurythmics
Rap rejects, my tape deck, ejects projectile
Whether Jew or Gentile, I rank top percentile
Many styles, more powerful than gamma rays
My grammar pays like Carlos Santana plays "Black Magic Woman"
So while you fuming, I'm consuming mango juice under Polaris
You just embarrassed 'cause it's your last tango in Paris
And even after all my logic and my theory
I add a "motherfucker" so you ignant niggas hear me
Crew remember take notes, as I sow my rap oats
And for you biting zealots, here's a quote

Another MC lose his life tonight, Oh
I beg that you pray to Jesus Christ, why
Oh Lord, father don't let him bury we, I

You can try but you can't divide the tribe
These cats can't rap, Mr. Author, I feel no vibe
The magazine says the girl should have went solo
The guys should stop rapping, vanish like Menudo
Took it to the heart, but every actor plays his part
As long as someone was listening, I knew it was a start
For me to get my chance, grab my pen and revamp
Do a cameo while everybody do the dance
Quick now, 'cause you running out of luck-a
Playing Mr. Big, I'm gonna get you sucka
While you munching at your luncheon
I'll be planning your assassination, then hit you like the Dutchman
I compress sound sets with my rap DBX
Then drop vocals on my 456 Ampex
Bring terror to the shop of horror
As she cry, "mi amor," the phantom dies in the opera
And to the youngins who carry gadgets
And kill six days a week, then rest on the Sabbath (Hold up, hold up)
Violence ain't necessary, unless you provoke me
Then get buried like the great Mussolini
And for you biting zealots, your rap styles are relics
No matter who you damage, you're still a false prophet

Ayy, another MC lose his life tonight, Lord
I beg that you pray to Jesus Christ, why
Oh Lord, father don't let him bury me, yeah

Yo what the fuck going on man?
Yo kid, we can't let these cops come around here
5-O come here and just do whatever want, rob, joke, or steal from people, shoot us down
We gotta do something about this man
I was with Floyd the other day
You know Floyd the cop, he just get a hard on from just shooting niggas5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
***
Where I was born, nothing is promised
My life is filled with less hope than the prophecies of Nostradamus
Omega marks the ending of predictability
Birth of agility
Who will it be to test me and expose their futility?
Iron like a lion from Zion, stop tryin' so hard
I think I smell your brain cells fryin'
The family's behind you if you're worthy
Philosophies developed deep in the back streets of dirty Jersey
Troops with skully hats and Timberland boots
No more breakdancing for loot, niggas hustle and shoot
In the Garden State, it grows stink weeds and criminals
Government funds are minimal, oppression's subliminal (Yo)

These days it's hard for we to find peace of mind
Between insanity and sanity there lies a thin line
Some dwell in hotels with jezebels
A stone age and fall a victim to the plague
Unclean bad dreams of Wyclef being a fiend
One last kiss from my sweet serpentine
Eliminate, break, navigate
To rejuvenate thoughts of suicide with my nickel plate
Reconcil'ation came from my enemy-friend
Who said, "Family don't bend, we stay solid 'til the end"
Now who would think that your best friend
Would be your worst enemy and your enemy your best friend?
Stare into the air, inspiration from the atmosphere
I think of old ghosts that ain't even here
Like Alex Haley, take notes on his biography
My family tree consists of street refugees
A ghetto land where we talk slang
Stolen cars bang like my chitty bang-bang
Shebang for the head, we ain't sellin' cocaine today
So refrain and let my family reign, okay
Just walkin' the streets death can take you away
It's never guaranteed that you'll see the next day
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So defend the family, that's the code to obey
But if I fall asleep and death takes me away
Don't be surprised, son, I wasn't put here to stay
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So the family sticks together and we never betray (Nah, fuck that)

Yo, fifty-two pick-ups, no cops around
Fifty-two thousand in cash, I don't want no savings bonds
Have the money ready, I smell something fishy
Your wife's in my custody, one false move, you'll find her body in the sea (Don't move, don't move)
That's the voice of the kid, that's the kidnapper
I do my work and then I catch my ticket to Jamaica
Meet me in the alley, make sure you bring the money
This ain't the seventies, I'm far from a jive turkey

My circle, it can't be broken open, cut-throatin', provokin'
Record promotin', tokin', chokin' on they words like smokin'
'Cause we soft spoken doesn't mean that we've forgotten
Your booty smell rotten and one day you will be gotten
See, jokers is scatter-brained, their focus is unrestrained
My army is trained, you never find us beefin' in vain
'Cause I've seen fire and I've seen rain
You claim fame while modest niggas remain
I can judge a character like Ito judge a verdict
And if you bringin' threats, I give you sex if I ain't heard it
See, poppin' shit's about your attitude and how you word it
I seen the biggest niggas on the blocks get murdered, and they deserved it
Or so the beast said when they served it, that shit is nervous
So what's my purpose? Family, we must preserve it
Your number's retired, I hope you like the hell fires
You'll be screamin', "Murder She Wrote" like Chaka Demus and Pliers
Just walkin' the streets death can take you away
It's never guaranteed that you'll see the next day
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So defend the family, that's the code to obey
If I should fall asleep and death take me away
Don't be surprised, son, I wasn't put here to stay
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So the family stick together and we never betray, yeah

We used to jump rope, but now we gun hold
Bustin' shots off of project rooftops
Sending signals with the blunt smoke
Ahk, don't talk a lot if you can't hold it in lock
If you think lips sink ships, imagine full Glock clips
I hold a glass of Remy Martin, gettin' milks by the carton
Extortin' the lightweights for thinkin' they important
The night pays in heavenly ways, ain't nothin' free
I ask knowledge in your family and step into your B.I. 
You see I stay on top of shit like a fly
My niggas reach when we got beef then jet down to South Beach
Your mouthpiece is yappin', I hear it in your rappin'
My family is thick so that bullshit could never happen (Yo)

Just walkin' the streets death can take you away
It's never guaranteed that you'll see the next day
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So defend the family, that's the code to obey
But if I should fall asleep and death takes me away
Don't be surprised, son, I wasn't put here to stay
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So the family stick together and we never betray
Yo, what you say?
Yo, word to mother, yo, I'll punch you and bust your whole head, kid
I swear to God, this is Shannon Briggs, I get paid to knock people out
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, Wyclef, chill, don't even hold me
Yo, word to mother, I'll— I'll— word, yo, chill, yo
I'm with the Fugees, what? You know what I'm sayin'? What?
Some come from nowhere
To watch this caravan

Now this happen to be the one and only  of the  crew
 dancehall session
And we don't play with sound clash
Soundbwoy get ah neck bash and he pussy dusted
Strumming dub plates with our fingers (You heard?)
Eliminate sounds with our song (No)
Killing a sound boy with this sound
Killing a sound boy with this sound (No)
Taking sound boys' lives with this dub
Killing him softly (You heard?) with this sound4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Warn the town, the beast is loose (Ah-ah)
Word 'em up, y'all
Warn the town, the beast is loose (Ah-ah)
Come on (Word 'em up, y'all)

Conflicts with night sticks, illegal sales districts
Hand-picked lunatics, keep poli-trick-cians rich
Heretics push narcotics amidst its risks and frisks
Cool cliques throw bricks, but seldom get targets
Private dicks sell hits like porno flicks do chicks
The 666 cut W.I.C. like Newt Gingrich sucks dick

Meanwhile the government brings Star Wars from Glock to glockers
C.O.P. has an APB out on Chewbacca
Mister Mayor, can I say something in yo' honor?
Yesterday in Central Park, they got the jogger (Okay, okay, okay)
Okay, let's get the confusion straight in ghetto Gotham (Mmhmm)
The man behind the mask you thought was Batman's Bill Clinton

On a mountain Satan offered me Manhattan, help me Jah-Jah

You can't search me without probable cause
Or that proper ammunition they call reasonable suspicion
Listen, I'll bring friction to your whole jurisdiction
You planted seeds in my seat when I wasn't lookin'
Now you ask me for my license, registration
Where the fuck do I work?
What the fuck is my occupation?
Well, I'm an MC, I'm down with the Fugees
Mother Mary caught a flashback like Rodney
Now the cops got Lolly
The subconscious psychology that you use against me
If I lose control, will send me to the penitentiary
Such as Alcatraz or shot up like El-Hajj Malik Shabazz
High class get bypassed while my ass gets harassed (Bang)
And the fuzz treat bruhs like they manhood never was
And if you too powerful, you get bugged
Like Peter Tosh and Marley was (Yeah)
And my word does nothing against the Feds
So my eyes stay red as I chase crazy bald heads, word up (Ah)

Warn the town, the beast is loose (Ah-ah)
Word 'em up, y'all
Warn the town, the beast is loose (Ah-ah)

The chase is on, I feel like the bad guy
Fifth gear, 125 like New Jersey Drive (By)
Looked in my rear view mirror (Yeah)
Police was getting closer (Closer)
Heard a roar in the sky, looked up and saw the Blue Thunder (Shit)
My inner conscious says throw your handkerchief and surrender
But to who? The star spangled banner?
Oh, say can't you see cops more crooked than we
By the dawn early night, robbin' niggas for keys
Easy, low-key crooked military
Pay taxes up my ass, but they still harass me
The streets of corruption got me bustin and cussin' in the concrete jungle
Thoughts being dribbled like that tall kid Mutumbo
Handled by Hannibal
Suitable to be a fugitive like Dr. Kimble
(Ayo, should I slow down now?) Nah, kid, go faster (Why?)
Just 'cause they got a badge, they could still be impostors
Probable cause, got flaws like dirty drawers
Meet me at the corner store so we can start the street wars (Ah)

Word em up, ya'll
Warn the town, the beast is loose (Ah-ah)
I can't sleep at night, ah (Warn the town)
Thoughts of the beast comin' to get me (Warn the town)
Project Heads, Refugee Camp
Yeah, watch out for gestapo

Right, right, one second
Okay, then, fine, your order
Alright, let me get, um

Soldiers
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right (It's time I settle the score)
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left (It's time I settle the score)

Look to the rhyme (Rhyme), rum to the ripple (Ripple)
Single, but at times I come in triple
Blaow, blaow, put the heater to your head
Now you dead
Wyclef don't give a ooh if you're dead
Rah, rah, let me attack just like a black cat
You in the wrong neighborhood, check your map
Ooh, you've gotta go for backup to do what you gotta do
So you'll be back with France CU
Traitor in your crew is mafo heat
You put poison in my tea and kill the toad, but I'll be back with the centipede
I'm on some new technique, drunken bamboo
A-hoo, a-hoo, a-hoo, I'm taking all crews, what?
Competition, stimulation for the rap man
Losers, check your tooters as I'm suckin' on your girl hooters
Don't play macho 'cause you got the gun, son
'Cause if you gotta reload (Man)
(You rocking loud but you ain't sayin' nothin')
It's time I settle the score

Yo, Wyclef the multi-talented, average heads can't handle it
I'll bring it to you live, only if you want it (Only if you want it)
Me and my guitar go back like the days of the R MC's (Come on)
(Check out my melody)
The W-Y-C-L-E-F, Wyclef
Through any contest, I'm victorious (Bing)
Still keep it real if you will, and manifest through your skills
Not by how many shells you peel

I'ma bring down the ruckus, play the nutcracker
Ruffneck rednecks, makes me no bother
Time after time, ask Cyndi Lauper (Time after time)
Boss, you don't want to fuck with my partners
Motion, commotion, what's your proposal?
Uphold two-fold, the crew is disposal
Like utensil, floss like dental
I autograph my lyrics with a number two pencil
(You rocking loud but you ain't sayin' nothin')
It's time I settle the score
(Oba-observing the hypocrites)
(They smile in my face, then they talk behind my back)
Soldiers

Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left (It's time I settle the score)

Yeah, I'm the L, won't you pull it? (Pull it)
Straight to the head with the speed of a bullet (Bullet)
Cuttin' niggas off at the meeky-freaky gullet
Lyrical sedative, keep niggas medative
Head rushers, I give to creative kids and fiends
Dreams of euphoria, aurora
To another galaxy, phallic see, be this microphone
But get lifted, lyrically, I'm gifted
Burn on it without the roach clip, it hinders, mind bender
Pleasure sender so frequently your nerve endings belong to me
Wrongfully, you put me down not receiving the full capacity of my smoke
Wack niggas choke from the fumes that I emote
Or emit shit
See, even I feel the mahogany
L, natural hallucinogen turning boys to men again
With estrogen dreams, release blues, yellows and greens
From Brownsville to Queens
(You rocking loud but you ain't sayin' nothin')
It's time I settle the score
(Ready or not, Refugees taking over)
('Cause we soft-spoken doesn't mean that we've forgotten)
(Now we're permanent at one)

Soldiers

(Diamond D)
I creep like a thief, no doubt the man's swift (Swift)
I'm more magnificent than Lee Van Cleef (Cleef)
You stand stiff and got the nerve to let your man riff
(We know where to run)
And start flakin' like dandruff (Come on)
Come on, son, my steelo's tight (Uh-huh)
'Cause by far, I'm the best producer on the mic (Right)
Born to write analytical conceptions
With precision, and leave lyrical incisions (Bing)

All J do is front and lie (Man, you crazy as hell)
Whatever, yo, I'm goin' to get something to drink
You alright? You straight? (Yeah, I'm straight)
I'll be right back
Ayo, LJ, I heard you fuckin' Michelle
Nigga, I been fuckin' Michelle
Michelle Leslie Brown? (Nigga, Michelle Leslie Brown)
From 225th Street?
Nigga, Michelle Leslie Brown from 225th Street
That play ball in the park?
Nigga, Michelle Leslie Brown from 225th Street that play ball in the park
Nigga, I been fuckin' her
What happened? What about her?
This nigga said he fucked Michelle (He said he fucked her)
There go Michelle right there, call her over, yo
Ayo, Michelle, come here for a second, baby (What?)
Come here (Ask her, ask her)
Ayo, you fucked J? (Hell no, ew, what?)
Nigga, not that Michelle Leslie Brown from 225th Street that play ball in the park
The other Michelle Leslie Brown
Nigga, that's the only one
Nigga, how many Michelle's is there?
Nigga, she got a cousin or some shit like that, man, I'm saying though
He's a frontin'-ass nigga on three

Yo Mona Lisa, could I get a date on Friday?
And if you're busy, I wouldn't mind taking
Saturday-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Round up de posse, Fugee comin' around the way
 Yo, hey nappy head
 Yo whashup?

 Hah, I got some of that lyrical cheeba cheeba
 Worrrrrd?
A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a Libra y'all
A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a Libra y'all

You wanna battle? Swing
I bring commanding men like I was king
In all your dreams I write the horror flick of Stephen King
Cling to false also those papers say ock
I got tired of the fat lady so I sing to my own opera
Ba-lang-balang-balang-to-de-man-de-rock-cause I love thee
If you live by the sword you will be die by the gun
Cause all guys tell lies, and more girls commits sin
I was ordered to Code Red, but now I'm chillin' with A Few Good Men
Assassination on the kid from the capitol
I never play the soap opera but now I'm in General Hospital
Condition critical, spirit over who's the physical
So if I die, catch me at the funeral
I'll fly away, ohh glory
With a mic in my hand to a land where only God knows me
And the angels write raps on holy paper
I said I'm lookin for Jesus, he said "Take the escalator
One flight up, is guaranteed He'll be there"
My sister'd be there, my mother'd be there
So...
Yo Mona Lisa, could I get a date on Friday?
And if you're busy, I wouldn't mind taking
Saturday-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Round up de posse, Fugee comin' around the way

I don't puff blunts so I always got my breath
Never had to battle with a bullet proof vest
They call me cock-weasel but I, still cave a chest
I don't wear Jheri curls cause I'm not from the West
No disrespect to the West, true indeed
I rock it to the East, the East is the seed
To see that them days back, yo sheepskins and Hot Tracks
Peace to Mr. Magic, things are getting tragic
Now we on some new stuff, I never feared the Ku Klux
My own clan is actin up, I blame it on the Phillie blunt
What you gonna do, kids are acting oooohhhh
Hill is gettin' badder, yo where's the corporate ladder?
Mr. Three Piece Suit
Check the square roots, Girbauds and Timberland boots
Nahhhh that's the serpents, and know them garment tips
I got a head full of problems and a hand full of nappy roots
I feel a Jones comin' down, yo I...

(I got the slang to make the chitty-bang-bang
A-rid-dang-de-dang, the nappy head bang)
No I, got the slang to make the chitty-bang-bang
A-rid-dang-de-dang, the nappy heads reign!

And if you're busy, I wouldn't mind taking
Saturday-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Round up de posse, Fugee comin' around the way
Nappy heads in the zone and we're not goin' home!

Hey yo a battle is a battle but a battle's not a battle
If it'sssssssssss snake doesn't rattle
Cause my style's as old as a reptile
As slick as a Nu Nile, as new as a new child
So come follow me to the land of Abraham
This land's your land, this land's my land
The blacker the black man, the better the next man
(Yo some nappy heads need to check they necks for red)
Ihhhh, feel injection
Put the needle to your skin feel reality's heroin
You maintain to put a negro in pain you used to diss me
"Oh you wanna hang with old Eddie Kane?"
Ain't nuttin wrong, snap your head to the song
Word is bond, you get wrong
I'll have you sing like Louis Armstrong
And I say to myself, what a wonderful world
But what the hell was so wonderful 'bout cotton in the farm
Mr. Slaaaaaave Maaaaan!
The harder they come, the harder they fall, so come one come all
Don't stall or I'mma stick you like a voodoo doll
Doors locked stop drawer for the count who drops
You slept on a kid from the boondocks
Out of Hootaville, land of the ill kill
Vailsburgh Viking so you know I'm top ranking Phil
Some say who coming like like the yuma but save the rumor
Cause I've been rockin ever since eighty-two
When I used to rock my Pumas...
A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a Libra y'all
A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a Libra y'all
A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a Libra y'all

Have you ever worn the mask? Yeah
One-two, one-two

M to the A to the S to the K
Put the mask 'pon me face just to make the next day
Feds be hawking me, jokers be stalking me
I walk the streets and camouflage my identity
My posse in the Brooklyn wear the mask
My crew in the Jersey wear the mask
Stick up kids doing boogie woogie wear the mask
Yeah, everybody wear the mask, but how long will it last? (Yo, yo)

I used to work at Burger King, a king taking orders
Punching my clock, now I'm wanted by the manager
Souping me up, saying, "You're a good worker
How would you like a quarter raise, move up to the register?
Large in charge, but ya gotta be a spy
Come back and tell me who's bagging my fries
Gettin' high on company time"
Hell no, siree, wrong MC (Wrong MC)
Why should I be a spy when you're spying me?
And you see what ya thought ya saw but never seen (Bing)
Ya missed ya last move, checkmate, crown me king
Pulled my .22, pistol-whipped him in his face
Hired, now I'm fired, sober, now I'm wired
Eyes pitch red but the beat bop my head
Hit the streets for relief, I bumped into feds (Oh my God)
I got kidnapped, they took me to D.C
Had me workin' underground, building missiles for World War III
M to the A to the S to the K
Put the mask 'pon me face just to make the next day
Brothers be gaming, ladies be claiming
I walk the streets and camouflage my identity
My posse Uptown wear the mask
My crew in the Queens wear the mask
Stick up kids with the Tommy Hil' wear the mask
Yeah, everybody wear the mask, but how long will it last?

I thought he was the wonder and I was stun-gunned by his lips
Taking sips of an Amaretto Sour with a twist
Shook my hips to the bassline, this joker grabbed my waistline
Puttin' pressure on my spine tryna get L-Boog to wind (Bing)
I backed up off him, then I caught him with five fingers to his face
I had to put him in his place, this kid's invadin' my space
But then I recognized the smile, but I couldn't place the style
So many fronts in his mouth, I thought he was the Golden Child
Then it hit me, that's Tariq from off the street around my grams
I haven't seen him since fifteen when he got booked for doing scams
I tried to walk away, but he wouldn't let me leave
He ran up quick behind me asking, "Yo, what happened to my nigga Steve?"
Steve was like this kid I went with back in grammar school
I chuckled, knucklehead, I seen him yesterday, he's cool
Busted, "So who you checking for now? Probably some intellectual"
I kept the conversation straight, but he kept tryna make it sexual
Then his old lady tried to play me, waved her hands up in my face
Yo, I told her, "Check your man, 'cause bitch, you acting out of place" (Come on)
M to the A to the S to the K
Put the mask 'pon me face just to make the next day
Brothers be frontin', then they be runnin'
I walk the streets and camouflage my identity
My posse in the Bronx wear the mask
My crew on the Isle wear the mask
Stick up kids rolling in the Omni wear the mask
Yeah, everybody wear the mask, but how long will it last?

Three a.m. in the morning on the boulevard
I'm still at large, engaged with my entourage
Me and Godfather and a '67 Dodge
I stepped out then looked, then post up my guard
Searching for my car that was stolen from Scotland Yard (Puerto Ricans got the car)
My first instinct was to check the chop shop garage
As I rung the bell, someone tapped me on my back
I turned around to look, it was a rookie in a mask (What?)
He said, "I got a itchin' on my trigger
Don't move, nigga, I'm taking you for murder"
See cops, got two faces like two laces on my Reeboks
My knees knock as I step back for a clear shot
(Well, did you shoot him?)
Nah, kid, I didn't have the balls
That's when I realized I'm bumpin' too much Biggie Smalls
M to the A to the S to the K
Put the mask 'pon me face just to make the next day
Runners be beefin', cops be thiefin'
Brothers be scheming, they should be teaming
Jokers be smoking and staying broken
Bitches be teasing, their money skeezin'
Niggas be creeping, baby mothers be weeping
I walk the street and camouflage my identity
My posse in the Haiti wear the mask
My crew in Jamaica wear the mask
Stick up kids bumping "Fu-Gee-La" wear the mask
Yeah, everybody wear the mask, but how long will it last?
Said
(M to the A to the S to the K)

Yo, man, we just rolled up there, shit was ill, man, it was ill
Yo, bullets everywhere, guns, smoke
Jokers fallin' off they porches just shootin', straight cowboys, man
Straight motherfuckin' cowboys4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I done something new for this fight
I murdered a rock, injured a stone
Hospitalized a brick
I'm so mean I make medicine sick

(Come on)
Root to the fruit
More bass than Bootsy Collins
You versus me
Thats like Ali verses Foreman (a-ha)
God's act, stand back and watch
Devil's time out
Can't be timed with no swatch watch
Who I am, the black Abraham
Zunga zunga zang, yellow man, Vietnam
Add an extra bar as I spar with literature
Taking kingdoms from tsars
Winning more wars than the Moors

Now what's the deal star?
I seen the Devil spar with Allah
Mathematics was the key to set my whole race free
You might debate we, a refugee
No harm hurt me
Dying, thirsty from the struggle
To my own hustle bubble
On the low, woe is me
To show the Free Bob right
The righteous Asiatic thinker
While Satan rob light
Civilized like the Mali
Burgundy, wildy rocking
Seen the fifth when Ali clocked him
John Forte he'll keep you locked in
People all around
You got to recognize and witness
The Mister who swift enough to knock you out with Mic fitness
Hands blistered from holding the mics tight
Some say it's fight night
Well throw the R after the F cause I'ma take away your breath
The bell rings and now it's just a daily operation
Yo, you soft like lubrication
You can see this occupation (The winner)
And you know we hail from Q-Borough
L-Boogs and Clef the trainers, Prazwell promotes the thorough

We used to bite the bullets with the pig-skin casing
Now we perfect slang like a gang of street masons (uh)
Scribe checks, make connects
True pyramid architects (yeah)
Replace the last name with the X (X)
The man's got a God complex
But take the text, change the picture
Watch Muhammad play the messenger like Holy Muslim scriptures
Take orders from only God
Only war when it's Jihad
See Ali appears in Zaire to reconnect 400 years
So we the people, dark but equal, give love to such things
To the man who made the fam' remember when we were kings
Blocks on fire (Block's on fire tonight)
Fiends getting higher (uh-huh)
Robbing blue collar
(Hey yo we rob them blue collars)
Killing for a dollar (Stick 'em up)
See youths get tired (Ali ah yeah)
Dealing with them liars (Ali ah yeah)
(We're dealing with too many liars)
From Brooklyn to Zaire (uh-huh ah yeah)
We need a ghetto Messiah (ah yeah come on)

Send me an angel in the morning, baby
Send me an angel in the morning, darling
Send me Muhammad in the morning, baby
Send me an angel in the morning, darling

Once the pen hits the pad it's danger
To this I be no stranger
Step inside the ring and I'll derange ya' (Come on)
I'm hearing no comments, everyone looks despondent
Dejected, rejected similar to Liston Catching licks
Beat it, Sonny
My man is still the greatest in this
To hell with Frazier, yapping' about that negative shit
Now listen, you can try and escape if you want to
But ask yourself, who the hell you gonna' run to?
Like Sade Adu, you got a punch that I can sleep to
Fugees, Tribe, Busta Rhymes forever coming through
We sing Amazing Grace over two dollar plates
One roll, snake eyes like Jake The Snake
Many lies put up for stakes, wash our sins at the Great Lakes
You and I cannot see eye to eye, so therefore we can't relate
I'm here, when I make myself crystal clear
You fled to Cape Fear when I laced you up in Zaire
Tussle with a lasso in the Royal Rumble
Separate boys from men in the concrete jungle

I remember when Cassius Clay flipped the script
Taking trips to Zimbabwe
Africans started calling the God, Ali Bumbaye (so bwoy)
So bright, it be the God stricken
God nutrition, lightly stricken (ha)
Blows that feel like you was poison bitten
Ha, yo, I'm 'bout to blister you and your sister
Predicting every ass whipping before my fights my nigga
This be your last warning once you walk right past the doorman
Ali and Foreman gonna' lock ass until the morning
Marvel finances provided by Joseph Mobutu
Special guests of honour like the Archbishop Desmond Tutu
We watched the Rumble In The Jungle
To see who be the targeted uncle, to be the first to fall and fumble
'Nuff blows they getting thrown, like solid milestones
Internally shaking up niggas, imbalance your chromosones
With the force of a thousand warriors
When I bust your ass, identify me as the lord victorious

Blocks on fire (You're a star)
(Blocks on fire)
Dudes getting higher (You're a star)
Robbing blue collar (You're a star)
(Yeah rob them blue collars)
Killing for a dollar (You're a star)
See people get tired (You're a star)
(Youths getting tired)
Of dealing with them liars (You're a star)
(We're dealing with too many liars)
From Brooklyn to Zaire (You're a star)
We need a ghetto Messiah10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(Bust) Yeah, this is the Fugees (Ahh, yeah)
Outsidaz in here (This happens on the block every day)
So, you wanna be a cowboy?
Everybody, get your guns and meet me in the back right now

Oh-lay-hee
Everyone wants to be a cowboy, grab your gun, boys
Oh-lay-hee
.45 by my side, do he live? No, the nigga die

Zen, zen-zen-zen, zen-zen-zen
You shot your bullet, but the bullet went— (Err)
Desperado, new word for rudeboy
I pull out my gun and plug two like Trugoy
Wyclef, Pace Won, yo, this was how the West was won
Our motto, a true desperado
Rappers want to be actors
So they play the Jesse James call-up card
And get they bones fractured
You ain't got no guns, you off to the precinct
Inside tough guys are feminine like Sheena Easton
Woman cry, woman cry, son still dies
Thrown off the building like The Fall Guy
Caved in the grave 'cause you didn't know how to behave (Huh)
Playin' cowboy, now you sleep with the slaves
Who's the desperado sellin' bottles in the alley
On some villain shit, wearin' a mask like Jim Carrey?
With his gat cocked, stinkin' up the crack spot
Pacewon dies with both eyes on the jackpot
The town that I'm from beggars eat cat chowder
Sundance Kid is the everyday purse snatcher (Gimme that)
If you see him coming, you better start running
Like a terrorist I guarantee you he'll be humming
Dynamite, dynamite, Clef I got the cash
Yo, let's skip town like Harlem Nights
Oh-lay-hee
Everyone wants to be a cowboy, grab your gun, boy
Oh-lay-hee
.45 by my side, do he live? No, the nigga die

We make moves in stage coaches, Rah Digga likes the roaches
If anyone approaches, we like noches buenos
Then I compose a poem for the many gun-slingers
R&B singers perpetrating guns with two fingers
My style is perhaps one of the foulest
I inhale large clouds of smoke through my chalice
(Buckin' at stars) And write rhymes for hours
The ghetto missy, drinkin' whiskey sours
Bust this scenario, can't no other niggas in the barrio
From North to Ontario, tame us when we in stereo
'Cause me and Rashida rock the battles
It's apparent you're no talent, 'cause you're blazin' in your saddle
Watch these rap bitches get all up in your pockets
Then bounce with accountants that give me good stock tips
'Cause props is up (Rah Digga)
Digga's through the roof, burnin' niggas like I'm 90 proof
And for all y'all head beaters, the lead eaters
The cheaters soon to be retreaters
While mamacitas carry real heaters
I rock the doobie and L rocks the Nubian twists
Nine-six, motherfuckers gettin' dissed
Oh-lay-hee
Everyone wants to be a cowboy, grab your gun, boys
Oh-lay-hee
.45 by my side, do he live? No, the nigga die (Yeah)

When the Outs hooked up with the refugees
It be more niggas than the NAACP (Mad niggas)
Comin' up on weed of all types
Smokin' home-grown out tobacco pipes (C'mon)
You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
I can take the sunshine, piss in your wine
Steal your concubine, walk away with your gold mine
So ooh, ahh, ahh-chi-ka
Mama-se, mama-sa, mama-ma-ku-sa
Fuck the sheriff, I shot John Wayne
Push him off the runaway train in the movie Shane
Yeah, me and that kid, um, what's his name?
That would be me, Young Zee from No Brain
Smokin' pure from the health food store
While my whore slap cops like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Fuck with Outs ,it's like those Islam brothers
We march through your hood with a million motherfuckers
So let's get high off the fu-gee-la
When the east is in the house like I'm Blahzay Blah'
When pandemonium strikes and midnight hits
Full moon splits soft niggas and the lunatics on some absurd shit
You talk back, hustlin' crack don't make you bigger
Niggas who take your measurements quick don't make it quicker
Stick and slide with vigor, city streets hot like liquor
21 gun salutin', shootin' niggas from the roof and
Got nerve to mouth about it and the weight you claim you movin'
Your whole style is loose and we gon' sew it like it's cotton
You fail to recognize that everybody could get gotten
The bounty on your head says you dead by mañana
Pop babies whisperin' that there's a body drop behind the lot
Police blew up the spot and locked the whole block
Medina is the east side of town lounge, never 'til we yawnin'
Gun play is regular, front page is the bonus
Life will keep existing as I'm shittin' on opponents
Life will keep existing as I'm shittin' on opponents

Oh-lay-hee
Everyone wants to be a cowboy, grab your gun, boy
Oh-lay-hee
.45 by my side, do he live? No, the nigga die (Cowboys)

Yo, man
It seem like we tryna get everybody, but they gettin' us
You know what I'm sayin'?
But, you know
No need to cry 'cause everything gon' be alright, man
It's gon' be alright, you know?
You know, it's just ill, yo
Last night, you know, all I seen was bullets and feet runnin' and backs, you know
And when the smoke cleared it was a little joker on the ground, man
No— Had to be no younger than thirteen, fourteen years old
Blood pourin' from his head
His mother on her— mother on her knees cryin', you know
Cryin' her head off
Tomorrow's headline is gonna be "The Death of Another Nigga"
You know what I'm sayin'?
"The Death of Another Nigga", you know?
That's how it always is
We cryin' for a afterlife while they just steal this one6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

A dedication to all the refugees worldwide
One time

Say, say, say
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Brooklyn
Oba-observing the crookedness
As it mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had, oh, good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say
And to my peeps who passed away

No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, say, say, say
Oh, hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

Say, say, say
I remember when we used to rock, oh
In a project yard in Jersey
And little Georgie would make the firelight
As stolen cars passed through the night
And then we'd hit the corner store
For Roots, paper, and brew
My drink's my only remedy
For pain of losing family
But while I'm gone, shorty
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Fugees come to the dance tonight
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Oh, everything is gonna be alright
The gunman's in the house tonight
But everything is gonna be alright
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah (I'm high)
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah

No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
Hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

Say, say, say
I remember when we used to sit
In a government yard in Trenchtown
Oba-observing the hypocrites
As they mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had, oh, good friends we've lost
Along the way, hey
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, say, say, say
Hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

And to my peeps who passed away
Oh, ah, oh-ah

(Before I manifest the rhyme)
Wyclef, Preacher's Son
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
Prazwell (Come on as we bug out)
(Before I man-man-manifest the rhyme)
I used to go to church
(Before-fore-fore I man-man-man-man)
L Boogie, drive the hearse (Manifest the rhyme)

I woke up this morning, I was feeling kind of high
It was me, Jesus Christ, and Haile Selassie
Selassie said, "Greetings in the name of the Most High
Jah Rastafari"
Christ took a sip of the Amaretto
Passed it down the table, said, "Today I'll be betrayed by one of you 12 Disciples"
Give me a clue, who could do this to you?
The kid on the block who make less money than you (Calm down)
Crooked cops pulled up, they offered him thirty pieces of silver
All he got to do is deliver the Savior
Right on Bergen Street from bad luck to good luck
My cup runneth over, pass it down, guzzle up
The time have arrived, the prophecy will manifest
I saw death, I got scared, butterflies on my chest
Father, if possible, pass this cup before me
Yo, it's too late, I chose my destiny in Gethsemane
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
(I'm-I'm man-manifesting)
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
(I'm manifesting)

You see I loved hard once (Once), but the love wasn't returned
I found out the man I'd die for, he wasn't even concerned
In time, it turned, he tried to burn me like a perm
Though my eyes saw the deception, my heart wouldn't let me learn
From, um, some dumb woman was I
And every time he'd lie, he would cry, and inside I'd die
My heart must have died a thousand deaths
Compared myself to Toni Braxton, thought I'd never catch my breath
Nothing left, he stole the heart beating from my chest
I tried to call the cops, that type of thief, they can't arrest
Pain suppressed will lead to cardiac arrest
Diamonds deserve diamonds, but he convinced me I was worthless
When my peoples would protest
I told them mind they business, 'cause my shit was complex
More than just the sex
I was blessed, but couldn't feel it like when I was caressed
I'd spend nights clutching my breast, overwhelmed by God's test
I was God's best, contemplatin' death with a Gillette
But no man is ever worth the paradise, manifest
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
(I'm-I'm man-manifesting)
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
(I'm manifesting)
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
(I'm man-manifesting)
(Before I manifest the rhyme, rhyme, rhyme, rhyme) Prazwell

Gun clap, shell cap, got them crawling on they backs (Facts)
Come through with the Fu, they be, "Who the fuck is that?"
It's unpredictable when my tongue performs Jiu-Jitsu
Cut you with my lyrics, stab you with my pencil (Come on)
Lethal injection, witness protection
Refugee camps under investigation
Gunshot bursts in all directions
For the wack MC's, we read your revelations (Uh-huh)
Discharge through your pores, get raw and kill boars
I can Capleton when I'm on a tour
Some manifest with slugs in they chest
God bless all the cowboys in the Wild Wild West

(Before I manifest the rhyme)
(I'm-I'm man-manifesting)
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
(I'm manifesting)
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
(I'm man-manifesting)
(Before I manifest the rhyme, rhyme, rhyme, rhyme)
Yo, my whole life was spent looking at myself through the eyes of a motherfucker that hate me
(So what, man?)
Drugged up most of the time
I remember one time I was so fucking high, man
I just got finished drinking, I came home, started sniffin'
I just got up and fell the fuck out, yo
Instead of my brother helping me up, he just start straight kicking me in the bathroom
"Yo, get up, get up, get up
Mom's goin' get us, yo, get up" (Yo, what the fuck?)
I wake up in the morning, man, laying in my throw up and shit all over my nose, man
You know what I realized? It's easy to kill niggas, man
It's easy to kill niggas 'cause they look like you
They smell like you
Shit, they even live on your same motherfuckin' block
The only problem we have is killin' the people who don't look like us
Who oppress us, shit (How you gon' do that?)
Ayy, if you wanna impress me, shoot the motherfucker who turned off my lights (True that, true that)
You want to impress me, shoot somebody who making my bills high all of the time
See, it's easy for cats to kill other cats, it's just the dogs they got trouble with
You know what I'm sayin'?
It's time for us to stand up like men and women, yo
Word up, we gotta stand up and do something about this
You know why?
You let a motherfucker kick you five times, they gon' kick you five times (True)
You let 'em kick you three times, they gon' kick you three times
You let 'em kick you twice, they gon' kick you twice
(I wouldn't let that nigga kick me once, you know what I'm sayin'?)
You let 'em kick you once, they gon' kick you once
But if you break off the motherfuckin' feet
Ain't gon' be no more kicking goin' on, kid (Oh, shit)
Ain't no more kickin'
I learned that shit growing up in Newark, man, the Brick City

Yo, this is the Fugees.. Refugees
About to take you on a journey
Into the dimensions of the Booga-Basement
The basement, word
Hey yo, one two three! The crew is called Re-Fu-Ge-ee-es
An if you come to test the rap stylee
Stop the violence and just bring it on, willld

Hey yo I, feel kind of melancholy people think they really know me
I keep a rap-book with me while I'm driving daddy's Audi
I pay the toll fighting for my own soul
Cause the bourgeoise type of mental sucks like a black hole
But I be baitin the rebel base to bass distort the EQ
The devil's wishin they could send me back to Mogadishu
Cause I've been wild since I was a juvenile
Afro-centric profile, back when righteous rap was your style
Now kids are whylin so I ask the bad black
Boogie bandit, what's the damage, gimme the estimate then
Pray tell me when's the revolution will begin?
I turn on my TV I check out Farrakhan on CNN see
I'm like the phantom that's flying like the bird do
And things you never heard plus I come from the suburbs
Word to God, I heard you're acting kind of hard
And you got your skin scarred when they was shootin on the boulevard
(You got the vocab) I got the vocab
(On the real got the vocab) You know we got the vocab
(All my peeps got the vocab) Yeah, we got the vocab
 Aiyyo Praz, grab the mic and show you got the gift of gab

Then cast off from here to Mexico
You see my four-five-six a-be my Celo
And when I rest my head is on a pillow
Be-ba-dee-be, be-dee-be, be-dee-be-bo
You see the skills I manifest is very tho-rough
And if you don't believe me ask Freres Ja-cques
Mmmm, Freres Jacques, Freres Jacques
A dorme vous? A dorme vous?
WATCH OUT NOW! When I choose to speak
I'm forming the cipher fly East to the Five Percenter
Knowledge is born, to all beginners
Cast the first stone, if you feel you ain't a sinner, ahh
Say o-ur father, who art in heaven
Forgive the foolish rapper for he not know how Fugee be steppin
Correct and, stopped and kept in, nuff respect to the
DJ, that be selectin, the type of record ahhh
(You got the vocab) I got the vocab
(The click's got the vocab) You know they got vocab
(Brooklyn got the vocab) We got the vocab
 Aiyyo Clef grab the mic and show you got the gift of gab
Check it out, here we go
Back in Eighty-TREE, no one wanted to be NAPPY
I turn on my TV, it's a dreadlock for FREE
Kill the gimmick -It's nonsense, it's no sense or value
A rapper, disaster, nobody ever told me that
"Roxanne, you don't got to work for money no more!!"... and...
Back in the days I used to listen to Kool G Rap
Way back when before guns became gats and
Run-D.M.C. used to ask Mary was she buggin?
I loved P.E., they kept me concious of what I was saying
Afrika Bambaata, Poor Righteous Teacher
Got within myself so it made me a Five Percenter
Say La-Di-Da-Di, UHH! we like to party but
My jam was BDP, with My Philosophy
Say Grandmaster Flash, MC Melle Mel
Then LL Cool J came with Rock the Bells!
See I'm the one for the crew, like a Jew is a Jew
Like Apollo got the moon, like the men who got the blue
Like the Fu got the Manchu, Shaka got the Zulu
Hawaii got the Honolulu
I got the rap lieu, so skippedy-de-bop-bop you don't stop
You do the rock-rock from hip-hop through be-bop
From be-bop to bee-bee
(You got the vocab) I got the vocab
(Boogie Down got the vocab) You know they got the vocab
(Black people got the vocab) Word, we got the vocab
Aiyyo peeps, grab the mic and show you got the gift of gab
(You got the vocab) Yeahh, we got the vocab
(Queens got the vocab) You know y'all got the vocab
(Uptown got the vocab) Yeahh, they got the vocab

From out the Refugee Camp we present to you, the group we call Fu-Gee
With Wyclef and Lauryn, Prazwell with the international Sly & Robbie on the hardcore reggae beat
Now my selector! Come now

(Can I feel the vibe?)
(Can I feel the vibe?)
We used to be number ten
Now we're permanent one
Wyclef, Preacher's Son, Ichiban
Listen Mrs. Tin Can
I'm your candy handy man
Me without you is like American without the Band Stand
Cool fellow, dancehall stay mellow
All that guntalk who would have thought you died yellow
Damn, another hero wannabe
Now he sleeps with his friends in the mortuary
Dude, I find it rude, when you intrude
My pistol nozzle hits your nasal
Doo-doo comes out your anal
Just because your buff, don't play tuff
'Cause I'll reverse the earth and turn your flesh back to dust

Ooh, la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doin' our thing
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the natural la that the Refugees bring
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing
(She love me like she never before, ayy)
Dig it! I stay high off the Fu-Gee-La
Bust when we rush through
You must  knew Ruckus Crew got G's like the refu's
So F whoever want to test
Bring me stress, west coast back to east
Grab my toast when I reach
Truly curvin', swervin, lifestyle is urban
Sippin' bourbon, surviving
We real to keep the word when
A boy want fa test this set
Then you get wet-up
Just a bit to unprepared to to shoot him, fair bet

Fake bullets can't scar me
I can smell the weak out like safari
Play you out like Atari
Sacrifice you Hari Kari
And I'm sorry
To every single rapper, Dick and Harry
Saying they want to spar me
'Cause how thick my repertoire and my memoir be
Reminding me of eating Calamari in the Kalahari
With a band of Rastafari so
Ha-ha-ha-ha, you shouldn't diss refugees, and
Ha-ha-ha-ha, you whole sound set booty, and
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doin' our thing
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the remix sound that the Refugees bring
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing
(She love me like she never before, ayy)

I sit 90 degrees underneath palm trees
Sitting in the cool breeze in the West Indies
Flea to sea, ship my keys
On the Santa Maria, sip Sangria with señoritas
(They keep telling me this and telling me that)
They smile in my face then they talk behind my back
But what they lack is the facts about my stats
My rap impact will kill you softly like Roberta Flack

Ayo, what's goin' on?
Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Tryin' to front like you're down with Mount Zion
Yo, what's goin' on?
Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Tryin' to front like you're down with Mount Zion (Zion)
Call Mister Martin, tell him to built a coffin
Today is death season, a hundred MCs are get murderin' (Stop it)
Call Mister Martin, tell him to built a coffin
Today is death season, a hundred MCs are get murderin', ha-ha-ha

Or cowboys, bang-bang, or whatever, you know

He wound up shootin' my man up in the street, in the hospital (Let me smoke this L, then tell me what you wanna do)
Trying to be cowboys, they can't even shoot
Trying to be gangsters, but when the beast come on the motherfuckin' block, everybody break out (Cowboy-ass niggas)
They beat my man Bob G. up the other day
Cops, pigs just vampin' on him, yo (Man, fuck the po-po, it's good for his ass)
Everybody standin' around just watching that shit take place (Those niggas ain't doing right, that nigga ain't smart)
This always take place
Because they only gangsters when it come to being gangsters to theyself
They wanna be Corleone or Luigi (Nigga, I am Corleone, what? What?)
Or Gambino or Gotti or whatever the fuck that is (I am Gambino)
Some people don't even like you, you know what I'm sayin'?
They run around callin' theyself Rahim or Fuquan or Mustapha
No shit, 'cause we think they got power  (What you wanna do then?)
Fuck them, I got power (What? What?)
I got power, I got a family (You ain't got no car, nigga)
I got family business on Avon, on Chancellor, on Prince Street (Y'all blowed up)
Chadwick, on Stratford, Chancellor, uh, uh, Vailsburg
All of the Brick City, boy, that's my family (I got family just around the corner)
We gon' settle the score, once and for all (Where your girl at?)
I ain't gon' sit around and let jokers kill me softly, kid
I'm going out, I'm going out like a bang
And all of these zealots out here (Man)

Like all these big record companies (Yeah)
These, uh, corporations, these stores, they try to rob me?
Naw man, I'm going— I'ma get mine (Man, fuck outta here)
And my girl, we gon' go out together
She gon' be a soldier, kid

Mista, mista
Can I get five dollars
So I can get something to eat?
Hell no, motherfucka
You can't get no money from me
'Cause every time I give you a dollar
You go get shot up with more and more needles
And you tell me that you're drug-free
Drug-free

Mista, mista
I haven't ate anything for a week
Can I get a quarter?
Hell no, motherfucka
What can a quarter get you?
Nothing, motherfucka
You are just fucked up
Off them fucked up drugs
You know you need to fucking leave alone
But you keep telling me that you're drug-free
Motherfucka
You ain't drug-free
You're a fiend
And every time I try to help you
You pretend as if it's okay
Then later on the week
You go back
To shootin' needles, to sniffin'
Oh, motherfucka, but you told me you were drug-free
Drug-free

You ain't drug-free, motherfucka
So you damn well can't get no motherfuckin' money from meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
