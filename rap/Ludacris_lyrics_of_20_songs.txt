All white top, all white belt

Comin' out swingin' like Tiger Woods' wife
Yeahhh, she could get a little hasty
Chicks better cover up they chest like pasties
Couple girlfriends and they ALL a little crazy
Comin down the street like a parade, Macy's

Trash talk to 'em then I put 'em in a Hefty
Runnin' down the court I'm dunkin' on 'em, Lisa Leslie
It-it-it-it-it's goin' down, basement
Friday the 13th, guess who's playing Jason
Tuck yourself in, you better hold onto your teddy
It's Nightmare on Elm Street and guess who's playin' Freddy
My chick bad, chef cookin' for me
They say my shoe game crazy, the mental asylum lookin' for me

I keep dwellin' on the past, babe
Know what I need, yeah

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence, some befriended me
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
Believe in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking 'bout "that's supposed to be you, girl"

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me
I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
Need solutions, less problems
Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em
Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me89EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah, and it go a little somethin'
Li-li-like this

Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

Now little Lisa's only nine years old
She's tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone and they never met her family
Momma's always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobody'll listen
Momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs, usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her momma's knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her
Lisa's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back (Like this)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

Little Nicole is only ten years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic stepdad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions, she's makin up excuses
Bleedin on the inside, cryin on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she's about
Her name is little Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight 'til the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and NEVER come back

Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops X to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin sex with her boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep as she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection, he's usin no glove
Never thinkin 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out, he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she 'bout to run away and NEVER come back, ah!

Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

Runaway, runaway love
Don't keep runnin' away
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
Run it, run it, run it, run it, ah-ah
Don't keep runnin', runnin' away
Don't, don't keep runnin', runnin' away
I know how you feel, I've been there
I was runnin' away too
I will run away with you, I will run away with you
Runaway, runaway love
Don't keep runnin' away
I'll run away with you, if you want me to
Yeah, I can only imagine what you goin through ladies
Sometimes I feel like runnin away myself
So do me a favor right now and close your eyes
And picture us runnin away together
When we come back everything gonna be okay
Open your eyes15EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If you live for somethin', you're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter, a toast to life

Luda
They say what don't kill me can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test
'Cause why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death?
I'm on a journey, yeah I'm on a roll
Sometimes gotta close my eyes just to open my soul
And tonight is the night I got a feeling that I'm about to act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher about to break some rules

That's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Oh, oh, oh

Na, na ,na, hey, oh
Na, na, na, hey, oh
Na, na, na, hey, oh
Na na, na, hey
For the rest of my life
If I got one life to live, I'ma party 'til I'm dead
What the hell is a life worth livin' if it's not on the edge?
Tryna keep my balance, I'm twisted so just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone should say "Women, Weed, and Alcohol"

That's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Oh, oh, oh

Na, na ,na, hey, oh
Na, na, na, hey, oh
Na, na, na, hey, oh
Na na, na, hey

If you live for somethin', you're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup (fill up your cup)
Lift your lighters, a toast to life
I'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of time
Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind
And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice
So I'm willin' to bet that I'ma be crazy for the rest of...

For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

BLAOW, we ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong? The club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull

But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes, got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest
Ahh, come on we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight

Move over; Luda got something to say
Do it now cause tomorrow ain't promised today
Work with me, let's become one with the beat

I'm too fast for y'all, man
Drop! 2 Fast
Drop! 2 Furious
I'm too fast for y'all, ahh!

You just came home from doin a bid
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Somebody broke in and cleaned out your crib
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Just bought a new pair and they scuffed your shoes
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now them cops tryna throw you in them county blues
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!

Talkin' about gats, traps, cops and robbers
It's 9-1-1, please call the doctor!
Evacuate the building and trick the pigs
Since everybody wanna piece, we gon split ya wigs
See some fools slipped up and over-stepped they boundaries
You about to catch a cold, stay the fuck around me!
Ya peeps talkin 'bout "What kinda shits he on?"
You disappear like "Poof, bitch be gone!"
You think twelve gon' catch me? Gimme a break!
I'm super-charged with the hide-away license plate
It seems they wanna finger print me and gimme some years
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears
I got suede on my roof, wood grain on the dash
Sheep skin on the rug, Golden Grain on the stash
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride
We go front, back and side to side, what?!
Some punk just tripped up and made you spill your drink
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now your car just stopped on a empty tank
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If you got late bills and you lost your job
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If you about to get drunk and you ready to mob
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!

Let's take it to the streets 'cause I'm ready to cruise
Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I love to park it
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
With the pedal to the floor, radar in the grill
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
It's my car's birthday, so we blowin' them candles
More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle
Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep
NOS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat
And when I pull up to the club, I get all the affection
'Cause the women love the paint and they can see their reflection
I'm about to take off, so F what ya heard
Because my side mirrors flap like a fuckin' bird
And the fools, we gon' clock one and we'll pop one
'Cause my folk ridin shotgun with a shotgun
You just got hustled for a wad of cash
Man whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash
Say whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now them gulls up the block still runnin they mouth
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If anyone talk bad about the Dirty South
Tell me what I'm gon' do? Act a fool!

I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the streets still smoking
See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is tipsy
Off the off-ramp, doin' about a hundred and fifty
Rollin through East Point, on way to Ben Hill
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin' and we startin' shit
I even got a trailer hitch with the barbeque pit
Now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is Fire 'cause we stomped you out
And yeah, we blow trees and beez that's fantastic
So girls, hold ya weave while I'm weaving through traffic
I kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart
You'll be like lil John Q and get a Change of Heart
It's one mission, two clips and some triple beams
I'm about to blow this whole shit up to smithereens!
The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Man, that ain't sticky, that's just sticks and stems!
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Catch ya man with another bitch up in ya bed
Ladies, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If the bottle's all gone and your eyes are red
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!

Come around the hood, see sittin' here lookin' good
Tell me what they mad for
You should be on the radio, soundin' like I made a million dollars
Tell me what they mad for
Tell me what they mad for
Girl tell me what they mad for
Tell me what they mad for

If you sellin' all the records and you fuckin' all the bitches
And you sit a top of the charts and you livin' out your wishes
With your chains all smothered and your watches all glittered
And your ghost and your phantoms all comin' home to visit
Or maybe cause your bitches was never really your bitches
With your baby mama fucking every rapper in the business
Niggas saying you was better when the drugs was in your system
Now your crack swag gone ever since you came from prison
Got you tweeting all stupid, is you skatin', is you dissin'
Found out your Ghost leased and your Phantom just rented
Won’t need it in your name like Pac when he went missing
Makaveli lives on so I’m riding on you bitches
Hail Mary be the witness, Lord Willin' I was dealing
Stupid motherfucking five star, tatted on his ceiling
Bullseye, be the motherfucking target for this killing
Ain't y'all the motherfuckers with the millions?
Come around the hood, see sittin' here lookin' good
Tell me what they mad for
You should be on the radio, soundin' like I made a million dollars
Tell me what they mad for
Tell me what they mad for
Girl tell me what they mad for
Tell me what they mad for

Is it cause I got houses on every coast
Or that I'm on that Forbes list making rich rappers look broke
While they blowing that smoke I'm blowing a couple millions
Making a killing stunting on imposters
Only rapper in the game with a grammy and a Oscar
Seven figure movie deals, eight figure bank runs
And I'm still feeding the same hood that I came from
Any car that you got I've already drove
Any chick that you hit, my nigga, I've already hoed
Say it with your chest, like these diamonds in my charm
Name on my headphones, label tatted on my arm
Air traffic control say Ludacris is insane
That nigga daugher's birthday is the tail number on his plane
Fuck with me, but nobody fucking with me
Taking a shot of my Cognac
More millions, real G's chugging with me
If I'm happy there's no reason you should be sad for
So if somebody, can somebody please
Come around the hood, see sittin' here lookin' good
Tell me what they mad for
You should be on the radio, soundin' like I made a million dollars
Tell me what they mad for
Tell me what they mad for
Girl tell me what they mad for

You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

Sing it, hoes (The world, the world, the world)
All over the world, baby
It's only right that I share my experiences with y'all
Cause I've been places you'll never imagine (That's right)
But I'ma start it at home
When I see a girl I like, I walk straight up to them and I'm like

Uh, hey girl, how you doin'?
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin'
And I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name?
If you jot down ya number, you'll get mine in exchange, hey
See I'm the man of this town
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinkin of me
We got people to meet and many places to see, hey
Mm, I'm really diggin' ya lips
But be careful where you walkin' when you swingin' them hips
I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causin' a crash
With your traffic jam booty, heads pausin' so fast, hey
I would'nt trade you for the world, I swear it
I like ya hair and every style that you wear it
And how the colors coordinate with your clothes
From your manicured nails to your pedicured toes (Woo)
(Oh yeah) The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

Yeah, you hear the song so dance
Don't always think I'm tryna get in your pants
Um, cause see me, my pimpin's in 3D
I'm takin' you places you only see on TV
Tryna show ya how you livin' is trife
How many guys you know can bring the Travel Channel to life?
One day we on the Autobahn swervin', drivin'
Next day, we in the sun on the Virgin Islands
If you with me ain't no time to sleep
Especially at Wet Willies on Miami Beach
But I drop you off and pay you no attention
If make it to Atlanta's Brina Brothers convention
Then jump in the car and just ride for hours
Makin' sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard
Hawaii to D.C., it's plenty women to see
So if yo ass don't show up, it's more women for me, hey
(Oh yeah) The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican Day Parade
Then at night, I'm in New Orleans drinkin' hand grenades
Outnumbered by the dozens at the Jazz Fest
In Mardi Gras, all the women tryna show me they chest, ay
I'm in Jamaica spendin' massive bucks
While the ladies all beggin' me to mashatuck
I had sad beginnings when I rapped with no fans
Now it's all happy endings on my lap in Japan, hey
I used to think that it was way too cold
'Til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes
Now I hit the Caribana every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago
Uh, oh yet and still
You wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil
(But where the best at?) Ain't no need of even askin' brah
The best women all reside in Africa, and that's real (Woo)
(Oh yeah) The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

Sing it, hoes (The world, the world, the world)

Pimpin' pimpin' pimpin'
Ladies and gentlemen as we ride out
Can we have all the real pimps
Please put both of your pinky fingers high in the air?
Now ladies, look around with me
Let's see if we can weed some of these niggas out
Cause it ain't no way that all these niggas could be pimpin'
Now if you happen to see a nigga
With two sweat patches up under his arms
Look like he been swimmin' in shoulder height water
Please tell that nigga, "Put your hands down"
If you smell like you been at work all day and Drakkar
Please put your hands down
Now look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air
If you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his hands
And lotion three quarters of his body
Please say, "Put your hands down"
If your spinnin' rims spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin'
If you are dancin' on the dancefloor
And you look to your left and your right
And there is not a woman in sight
Guess what? You guessed it - you are not pimpin'
If your vodka and cranberry is really really dark like blood
That's because you didn't order Vodka buddy
That's why it's three dollars a glass, a-put your hands down
Now look down, look down
I need, I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time
Okay, you see the nigga with the white socks? Not pimpin'!
Sorry, unless you part of the Beat It entorauge
If your shoes have a buckle on 'em, you're not pimpin'6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Let's try the whole Kama Sutra, get down
Drip down, let it trickle down, dig her down
Smack it up, flip it and rub it down, love her down

I'm never lettin' the opportunity pass me
But I love her boots when they thigh high
Guess it's true what they say when you're havin' fun, the time, it really do fly by
Take her legs, put 'em sky high
Climb to the top, I'ma skydive
Off, you feel the pump like it's sawed off
Shot gun, hold tight, don't fall off
Work, I'ma call off
Don't be tryna leave, lil mama, that's too much ass to haul off
You need a U-Haul, if you leave me, woman, I'ma get blue balls

She ain't for that he say, she say
This shakin' the DJ replay

And she got to work with a smile on
And her skin is always glowin'
And her JJ ain't all in the streets

Hi, my name's Ludacris, and I'm high as giraffe pussy
And I'm close to the edge, so your parents can come push me
I curse so much just to get on they nerves
I got kids actin' a fool from the traps to the 'burbs
My filthy mouth, it won't fight cavities or beat plaque
So I shot the tooth fairy and put my old teeth back
I take a shit on the equator, the size of a crater
And make government officials breathe harder than Darth Vader
It's the chicken and the beer that makes Luda keep rappin'
But no pork on my fork, I don't even speak pig Latin
I go fishin' on my lake, with yo bitch as the bait
Plus I eat many MCs, but I don't gain no weight
The numba one chief rocka, clean out yo' rap lockers
I'm as stiff as a board, y'all more shook than maracas
But my trix ain't for kids, if you dig'um you'll get smacked
I'll clock ya I'll spring forward, you fall back
Every album that I drop has got more than ten bangers
That's cause I'm a shot caller, y'all fools is Crank Yankers
Ain't a damn thing changed but the ice on my chain
To get chicks from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine
Now I roll up torpedoes, get blunted with rastas
For a hefty fee, I'm on your record like Bob Costas
I own so many jerseys, I'm a throwback mess
I hit the cleaners and tell 'em I want a full-court press (Ow)
So momma toast your glass while I'm countin' my cash
'Cause every single is a smash, I'm hot as a camel's ass
The competition never just wanna admit that they lost
And that they last about as long as my part in The Wash
From yo' car to a crap game, no one rolls wit'chu
One of Mini-Me's shoes got more sole than you
So by the time you figure out why your record ain't spinnin'
I'm in the strip club smokin' with President Clinton
So stand clear of the long sideburns and goatee
They made the mold of the penis enlarger off me (Me)
I'll be in another room when I hit from the back
Not to mention my refrigerator's taller than Shaq (Yeah)
So yippie kay yay, yippie yie yie yo (Yo)
If you can't swim, don't smoke my hydro ('Dro)
I've been lookin for a woman just to put my stamp on
But a lot of y'all are mo' stuck up than tampons (Woo)
So wash all your sins away and stop playin' (Yeah)
If God's line is busy you might have to two-way him (Mhm)
Then catch me in your backyard, playin' croquet
And when I'm drunk, tell them kids, "Drugs are bad, mmm'kay?"?
Or watch me swing my chain at the Roscoe's off Pico
Got seven cars, get all my rims at Chrome Depot
And people think I'm bad, they say "Ooh, he's so evil!"
'Cause I go on blind dates with actual blind people (Ow)
But my album's out the store, yours be on the shelf
I heard you masturbate a lot, so y'all keep to yourself
'Cause these women want a man that stay up and stay strong
Like the NBA, you gotta play hard or go home
All that shit that y'all talkin', y'all can pop it to them
'Cause Ludacris'll beat you down with a prosthetic limb
I put my foot so deep in your ass that you can smell it
And your breath will turn to Foot Locker water repellant
I'm the man, I got money far as the eyes can see
And I'm in a group, I split dough with me, me, and me
So much money in my jewelry that I'm damn near sorry
So I'ma trade my earrings in and get a Ferrari (Woo)
I buy cars with straight cash, have meetings with Donald Trump
Y'all meet with Honda, no payments for twelve months (Uh-huh)
Take a look at yo' life, and no wonder you so sad
Y'all put up with more shit than a colostomy bag (Fool)6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
