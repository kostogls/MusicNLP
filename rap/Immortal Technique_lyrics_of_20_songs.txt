I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
His primary concern was makin' a million
Bein' the illest hustler that the world ever seen
He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams
A corrupted young mind at the age of 13
Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend
She put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober
Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder
He started hangin' out, sellin' bags in the projects
Checkin' the young chicks, lookin' for hit-and-run prospects
He was fascinated by material objects
But he understood money never bought respect
He built a reputation, 'cause he could hustle and steal
But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal
So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
You see, me and niggas like this have never been equal
I don't project my insecurities on other people
He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential
The product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental
Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
Dancin' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
But he was sick of sellin' trees and gave in to his greed
Everyone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance
But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot

So Billy started robbin' niggas, anything he could do
To get his respect back in the eyes of his crew
Startin' fights over little shit up on the block
Stepped up to sellin' mothers and brothers the crack rock
Workin' overtime for makin' money for the crack spot
Hit the jackpot, and wanted to move up to cocaine
Fulfillin' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
Tired of the block niggas treatin' him the same
He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love
They told him any motherfuckin' coward can sell drugs
Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs
Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood
Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club
But only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die
Standin' in front of them, starin' straight into their eyes
Billy realized that these men were well-guarded
And they wanted to test him before business started
Suggested rapin' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted
So now he had a choice between goin' back to his life
Or makin' money with made men up in the cyph'
His dreams about cars and ice made him agree
A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three
Everyone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance
But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot

They drove around the projects slow while it was rainin'
Smokin' blunts, drinkin' and jokin' for entertainment
Until they saw a woman on the street, walkin' alone
Three in the mornin', comin' back from work, on her way home
And so they quietly got out the car and followed her
Walkin' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her
They wrapped her shirt around her head
And knocked her onto the floor
"This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw"
So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair
And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
She struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs
They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
Screamin', "Shut the fuck up, and stop movin' around!"
The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed
So Billy stomped on the bitch until he'd broken her jaw
The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin'
They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin'
Blood leakin' through the cloth, she cried silently
And then they all proceeded to rape her violently
Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn
Rippin' her up and chokin' her until her throat burned
Her broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned
When they were done and she was lyin'
Bloody, broken and bruised
One of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22
They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through
And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead
And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back

Right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life
He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice
And he felt strong standin' along with his new brothers
Cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover
But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter
'Cause he was starin' into the eyes of his own mother
She looked back at him and cried 'cause he had forsaken her
She cried more painfully than when they were rapin' her
His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate
His corruption had successfully changed his fate
And he remembered how his mom used to come home late
Workin' hard for nothin', because now what was he worth?
He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
And cryin' out to the sky, 'cause he was lonely and scared
But only the Devil responded, 'cause God wasn't there
And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it
After that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it
And listen, 'cause the story that I'm tellin' is true
'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too
And now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go
In fact, I'm sure he's standin' among one of you at my shows
And every street cypher, listenin' to little thugs flow
He could be standin' right next to you, and you wouldn't know
The Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked
White, brown, yellow and black — color is not restricted
You have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted
And you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot
So when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
Because a dance with the Devil might last you forever

Oh, y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh?
Well, it’s not, you didn’t count on a fallen angel gettin' back
Into the grace of God and comin' after you
Y’all niggas ain’t shit, your producers ain’t shit
Your fuckin' A & R ain’t shit
I’ll fuckin' wipe my ass with your demo deal
Yo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker’s head off!

Go ‘head and grip Glocks
I’ll snap your trigger finger in six spots
You’ll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots
I’ll watch you topple flat
Put away your rings and holla back
Can’t freestyle; you’re screwed off the top, like bottle caps
Beneath the surface
I’m overheatin' your receiving circuits
By unleashin' deeper verses than priests speak in churches
What you preach is worthless
Your worship defeat the purpose
Like President Bush takin' bullets for the secret service
Beyond what y'all fathom, I shit on cats and jaw tap 'em
Show no compassion, like havin' a straight-faced orgasm
Tour jack 'em, have his half-a-10 bitch suck my friend’s dick
In the meantime, you can french kiss this clenched fist
Diabolic: a one-man brigade spreadin' cancer plague
Fist-fuckin’ a pussy’s face, holdin' a hand grenade
So if I catch you bluffin', faggot, you’re less than nothin'
I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction

You motherfuckers are nothin', you cannot harm me
I’ll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army
Storm the planet, huntin' you down, 'cause I’m on a mission
To split your body into a billion one-celled organisms
Immortal Technique’ll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch
You’re faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix
I’m 'bout to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chips
Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily
I’m like time itself: I’m gonna kill you inevitably
Chemically bomb you, fuck usin’ a chrome piece
I’m Illmatic, you won’t make it home, like Jerome’s niece
I’ll sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me
And then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy
This puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology
So you’re nothin', like diversity without equality
And your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology
Usin' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven
Produces more digits than 22 divided by seven
You’re like Kevin Spacey: your style is usually suspect
You never killed a cop, you, not a motherfuckin' thug yet
Your mind is empty and spacious
Like the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist
Face it, you’re too basic, you’re never gonna make it
Like children walkin' through Antarctica, butt-naked168EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
***
She was on her way to becomin' a college graduate
Wouldn't even stop to talk to the average kid
The type of Latina I'd sit and contemplate marriage with
Fuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire
Disciplined, intellectual beauty is what I desire
Flyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez
Everyone told me, kickin' it to her was hopeless
At first I just thought she didn't mess with broke kids
The thug niggas always talkin' about how they smoke kids
But the rich sniff-coke kids got no play
"I'm not even interested" is what her body language would say
Everyone around the way gave up tryin' to get in it
It didn't matter how good your game was, she wasn't with it
On the block, bitches was jealous but wouldn't admit it
Talk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it
Cause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it
And no one ever gave them shit except McDonald's and did-dick
Smokin' weed, with thoughts of envy whenever they lit it
She spoke intelligently and they bit it, always tryin' to copy
But when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy
She had a style, all her own, respectful and pure
I was sick in the head for her, and there wasn't a cure

Don't you know that time waits for no man?
My fate, it's all planned
I'm blessed just to know you
I've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night
Can't find a reason why
God came between you and I
And if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go
Hold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know
Her eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad
I used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad
That I wasn't just another nigga tryin' to get in it
So every now and then we'd stop and talk for a minute
I didn't have a gimmick, so the minutes turned to hours
On her birthday I gave her a poem with flowers
Then I took her out to dinner after her cousin's baby shower
We talked about power to the people and such
We spent more time together, but it was never enough
I never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feel
I was too interested in keepin' it real
Perfectly honest and complete
She would always call me "cariño" and never Technique
Bought me a new book to read every two or three weeks
Forever changin' the expression of my thoughts when I speak
It was because of her I even deaded all of my freaks
She convinced me to stop hangin' out on the streets
To stop robbin' and stealin' from people like you
Instead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo
Museo del Barrio, and the Metropolitan too
Got to the point when I was either with her or my crew
So I decided one day to tell her my feelings was true
I couldn't live without her, so I told her, facin' my fears
But honey's only response was a face full of tears
She could only sob hysterically, holdin' me tight
I tried to speak, but she wouldn't stop until I left sight
I felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light
Except I didn't burn, I turned cold after that night
Don't you know that time waits for no man?
My fate, it's all planned
I'm blessed just to know you
I've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night
Can't find a reason why
God came between you and I
And if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go
Hold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know

I went on with my life, college and my career
Ended up locked up like an animal for a year
Where the C.O.'s talk to you like they were the overseer
Then I got sent to the hole when my exit was near
At night in my cell, I'd close my eyes and I'd see her
Hold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared
Just an empty cell until the state gave me parole
In the summer, came back, intact and on track
But the fact of the matter is I still felt cold
Even after my mother hugged me, cryin' at home
My real niggas would catch me thinkin', outta my zone
Fuckin' lots of different women, but I still felt alone
Relatively well-known around the New York underground
But I kept thinkin' of her and how we used to be down
The sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair
Though gone physically, somehow it was still there
I had to do somethin' because the shit was too much to bear
So I went and visited the building where she used to live
The world looks a lot different after you do a bid
The way your life done changed
While primitive minds are still stuck in the same game
Like her cousin who was on the corner, slangin' cocaine
Stepped in the lobby, and tapped the button next to her last name
Her mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughta
But her facial expression changed
When I asked about her daughter
Don't you know that time waits for no man?
My fate, it's all planned
I'm blessed just to know you
I've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night
Can't find a reason why
God came between you and I
And if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go
Hold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know

She told me that there was a note, for me, that was left behind
And she had left it there waitin' for such a long time
I was inclined to ask about it, but she brought it up first
I saw a tear swellin' up in her eye, and then she cursed
She told me where the letter was, and I started thinkin' the worst
Reversed my position, stepped over and opened the door
And sure enough there was an envelope
With my name on the floor: "Nobody loves you more than me, cariño," is what the letter said
"By the time you get to read this, I'll probably be dead
But when you left in '97, a part of me went to Heaven
I thank God at least I got to know what love really was
But it hurt me to see what true love really does
‘Cause even though we never made love
You were all that there was
It was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave
You made me doubt the way I thought
You made me want to believe
And then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me
It was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me
This was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be
Baby, don't you see?
I had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV
Hope didn't exist for me since late in 1993
I died a virgin, I wish I could've given myself to you
I cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you
Promise that you'll meet me in Paradise inevitably
No matter what, I'll keep your love forever with me."
What happened for the rest of the day is still a blur
But I remember wishin' that I was dead, instead of her
She was buried on August 3rd
The story ends without a sequel; and now you know why Technique don't fuckin' fall in love with people
Hold the person that you love closely if they're next to you
The one you love, not the person that'll simply have sex with you
Appreciate them to the fullest extent and then beyond
‘Cause you never really know what you got until it's gone42EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah, it's that real this time around
Immortal Technique, Revolutionary Vol. 2
It's on now, motherfucker, lock and load!

This is the point of no return, I can never go back
Life without parole, upstate, shackled and trapped
Livin' in the hole, lookin' at the world through a crack
But fuck that, I'd rather shoot it out and get clapped
I've gone too far, there ain't no comin' back for me
Auschwitz gas chamber full of Zyklon-B
Just like the Spanish exterminatin' Tainos
Rapin' the black and Indian women, creating Latinos
Motherfuckers made me out of self-righteous hatred
And now you got yourself a virus, stuck in the Matrix
A suicide bomber strapped and ready to blow
Lethal injection, strapped down, ready to go
Don't you understand they'll never let me live out in peace?
Concrete jungle, guerrilla war out in the streets
Nat Turner with the sickle, pitchfork, and machete
The end of the world, motherfucker, you not ready
This is the point of no return and nobody can stop it
Malcolm Little when he knelt before Elijah Muhammad
The comet that killed the dinosaurs, changin' the Earth
They love to criticize, they always say I change for the worse
Like prescription pills when you misusin' 'em, nigga
The Templar Knights when they took Jerusalem, nigga
And figured out what was buried under Solomon's Temple
Al-Aqsa, the name is not coincidental
I know too much, the government is tryin' to murder me
No comin' back, like cuttin' your wrists open vertically
How could the serpent be purposely put in charge of the country?
Genetic-engineered sickness spread amongst me
My people are so hungry that they attack without reason
Like a fuckin' dog rippin' off the hand that feeds him
Immortal Technique is treason to the Patriot Act
So come and get me, motherfucker, 'cause I'm not comin' back
This is the point from which I can never return
And if I back down now, then forever I'll burn
This is the point from which I can never retreat
'Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die or succeed
Livin' the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on, it can never be the same as before
'Cause the place that I'm from doesn't exist anymore

This is the point of no return, nigga, you better believe this
Mary Magdalene givin' birth to the children of Jesus
The evolution of the world, bloody and dramatic
Human beings killin' monkeys to conquer the planet
The kingdoms of Africa and Mesopotamia
Machine-gunnin' your body with depleted uranium
This is the age of microchips and titanium
The dark side of the Moon and contact with aliens
I started out like Australians: criminal-minded
Broke into Hell, tore it down, and built a city behind it
Southpaw, murderous methodology, nigga
Remember that I'm just a man, don't follow me, nigga
'Cause once you past the point, you can never go home
You've got to face the possibility of dyin' alone
So tell me, motherfucker, how could you die for the throne
When you don't even got the fuckin' heart to die for your own?
It rains acid, one day the Earth will cry from a stone
And you'll be lookin' at the world, livin' inside of a dome
Computerized humanity livin' inside of a clone
This is the place where the unknown is livin' and real
Wormwood to Planet X and the Seventh Seal
Universal truth is not measured in mass appeal
This is the last time that I kneel and pray to the sky
'Cause almost everything that I was ever told was a lie
This is the point from which I can never return
And if I back down now, then forever I'll burn
This is the point from which I can never retreat
'Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die or succeed
Livin' the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on, it can never be the same as before
'Cause the place that I'm from doesn't exist anymore22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Asshole

I'm obnoxious, motherfucker, can't you tell?
Run through Little Havana, yellin', "¡Viva Fidel!"
Jerkin' off with the sheets when I stay at hotels
Drinkin' Bacardi at AA meetings, smokin' a L
I'm broke as hell, my attitude is no good
Like workin' for white people after watchin' Rosewood
So I'm a mercenary, I don't care how I get richer
Like American companies that did business with Hitler
Get the picture, nigga? I'm the best of both worlds
Without the hidden camera, and the 12-year-old girl
Let's face it, you're basic, you aren't half the man that I am
I'll throw your gang sign up, and then I'll spit on my hand
Give me a hundred grand!
Give me your watch! Give me your chain!
That's your girl? Bitch, get over here! Give me some brain!
I'll bust off on her face, and right after the segment
She'll probably rub it in her pussy, tryna get herself pregnant
I said it, I meant it, that's the way I deal with enemies
Like pro-lifers that support the death penalty
And don't talk about war when niggas know that you puss
A fuckin' hypocrite draft-dodger like George Bush
Don't push me, nigga, 'cause I'm close to the edge
And I'll jump off with a rope that's wrapped around ya head
Send a dead fetus to my ex on Valentine's Day
The safety's off, nigga, so get the fuck out my way!
Obnoxious, nigga, murderous lyrics
I know that you hear it
Now that I'm gettin' closer and closer, I know that you feel it
You're eatin' off rap, and I hope you choke on your gimmick
Niggas said Hip-Hop was dead, but I'm invokin' the spirit
We takin' it back in the day to the Golden Age
When wack motherfuckers used to get thrown off stage
Immortal Technique, I made this to bump in your ride
Or burn it off the Internet and bump it outside
Nigga, we keepin' it live, we keepin' it live
We keepin' it live, we keepin' it live
Burn it off the fuckin' Internet and bump it outside

Look, motherfucker, my words damage and slaughter
A ragin' alcoholic like the President's daughters
Disgustin' flow, like third-world-country tap water
But before I hit the border, someone give me a quarter
'Cause I'ma prank call COP-SHOT just for kicks
Payback for every time that they called me a spic
And Puerto-Rican chicks tell me that I fuck like I'm loco
And Dominican women call me the "Rompe Toto"
They call me "ocioso," I'd rather get fired than quit
I get unemployment, you work, and we makin' the same shit
How dare you niggas criticize the way that I spit?
You coffee-shop revolutionary son of a bitch!
But you know what the fuck I think is just pathetic and gay?
When niggas speculate what the fuck 'Pac would say
You don't know shit about a dead man's perspective
And talkin' shit'll get your neck bone disconnected
Disrespected, niggas don't show no love
Why you tryna be hardcore, you fuckin' homo thug?
And don't be sensitive and angry at the shit that I wrote
'Cause if you can take a fuckin' dick, you can take a joke
I'll choke your friends in front of you to prove that you've fallen off
And you won't do shit about it
Like the Church during the Holocaust
Kalashnikov machine gun flow that I fire
Obnoxious until they shoot me on the day I retire
Obnoxious, nigga, murderous lyrics
I know that you hear it
Now that I'm gettin' closer and closer, I know that you feel it
You're eatin' off rap, and I hope you choke on your gimmick
Niggas said Hip-Hop was dead, but I'm invokin' the spirit
We takin' it back in the day to the Golden Age
When wack motherfuckers used to get thrown off stage
Immortal Technique, I made this to bump in your ride
Or burn it off the Internet and bump it outside
Nigga, we keepin' it live, we keepin' it live
We keepin' it live, we keepin' it live
Burn it off the fuckin' Internet and bump it outside

Damn, homie!
In high school I beat the shit out of you and your man, homie
Your girl wanna blow me, and don't even know me
She lonely, and she think you a phony
I take a piss on a development deal from Sony
Or Def Jam, 'cause you're like all of the rest, man
This ain't a verse, this is shit-talk at the end of the song
And you can suck a dick if you think I ended it wrong
Fuck you and I'm gone, ha ha ha ha!

Peace to the Stronghold, EOW

The new age is upon us
And yet the past refuses to rest in its shallow grave
For those who hide behind the false image of the son of man
Shall stand before God (God, God, God, God, God, God, God)
It has begun, the beginning of the end
Yeah ... yeah ... yeah, yeah

The voice of racism preaching the gospel is devilish
A fake church called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist
Forgetting God is not religion, but a spiritual bond
And Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Qu'ran
They bombed innocent people, tryna murder Saddam
When you gave him those chemical weapons to go to war with Iran
This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings
'Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a new age Sally Hemings
I break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish
The Judas I hang with, the guilt of betraying Christ
You murdered him, stole his religion, and painted him white
Translated in psychologically tainted philosophy
Conservative political right-wing ideology
Glued together sloppily, the blasphemy of a nation
Got my back to the wall 'cause I'm facin' assassination
Guantanamo Bay, federal incarceration
How could this be the land of the free, home of the brave
Indigenous holocaust, and the home of the slaves?
Corporate America dancin' offbeat to the rhythm
You really think this country never sponsored terrorism?
Human rights violations, we continue the saga
El Savador and the Contras in Nicaragua
And on top of that, you still want to take me to prison
Just 'cause I won't trade humanity for patriotism
It's like MKUltra, controllin' your brain
Suggestive thinkin’, causin’ your perspective to change
They want to rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto
The fourth branch of the government want us to settle
A bandanna full of glittering generality
Fightin' for freedom and fightin' terror, but what's reality?
Read about the history of the place that we live in
And stop letting corporate news tell lies to your children

Flow like the blood of Abraham through the Jews and the Arabs
Broken apart like a woman's heart, abused in a marriage
The brink of holy war, bottled up like a miscarriage
Embedded correspondents don't tell the source of the tension
And they refuse to even mention European intervention
Or the massacres in Jenin, the innocent screams
US-manufactured missiles and M16s
Weapon contracts and corrupted American dreams
Media censorship blockin’ out the video screens
A continent of oil kingdoms bought for a bargain
Democracy is just a word when the people are starvin'
The average citizen made to be blind to the reason
A desert full of genocide where the bodies are freezin'
And the world doesn't believe that you fightin' for freedom
'Cause you fucked the Middle East and gave birth to a demon
It's open season with the CIA buggin' my crib
Trapped in a ghetto region like a Palestinian kid
Where nobody gives a fuck whether you die or you live
I'm tryna give the truth and I know the price is my life
But when I'm gone they'll sing a song about Immortal Technique
Who beheaded the president and the princes and sheiks
You don't give a fuck about us, I can see through your facade
Like a fallen angel standing in the presence of God
Bitch niggas scared of the truth when it looks at you hard
It's like MKUltra, controllin' your brain
Suggestive thinkin’, causin’ your perspective to change
They want to rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto
The fourth branch of the government want us to settle
A bandanna full of glittering generality
Fightin' for freedom and fightin' terror, but what's reality?
Martial law is coming soon to the hood to kill you
While you hangin’ your flag out your project window

Yeah
The fourth branch of the government AKA the media
Seems to now have a retirement plan for ex-military officials
As if their opinion was at all unbiased
A machine shouldn't speak for men
So shut the fuck up, you mindless drone
And you know it's serious
When these same media outfits are spending millions of dollars on a PR campaign
To try to convince you they're fair and balanced
When they're some of the most ignorant and racist people
Giving that type of mentality a safe haven
We act like we share in the spoils of war that they do
We die in wars, we don't get the contracts to make money off 'em afterwards
We don't get weapons contracts, nigga
We don't get cheap labor for our companies, nigga
We are cheap labor, nigga
Turn off the news and read, nigga ... read

Immortal Technique
Revolutionary Vol. 2, yeah
Broadcasting live from Harlem, New York (Yeah)
Let the truth be known

You better watch what the fuck flies out of your mouth
Or I'ma hijack a plane and fly it into your house
Burn your apartment with your family tied to the couch
And slit your throat so when you scream only blood comes out
I doubt that there could ever be a more wicked MC
'Cause AIDS-infested child molesters aren't sicker than me
I see the world for what it is, beyond the white and the black
The way the government downplays historical facts
'Cause the United States sponsored the rise of the Third Reich
Just like the CIA trained terrorists how to fight
Build bombs and sneak box cutters onto a flight
When I was a child, the Devil himself bought me a mic
But I refused the offer, 'cause God sent me to strike
With skills unused like fallopian tubes on a dyke
My words'll expose George Bush and bin Laden
As two separate parts of the same seven-headed dragon
And you can't fathom the truth so you don't hear me
You think Illuminati's just a fuckin' conspiracy theory?
That's why conservative racists are all runnin' shit
And your phone is tapped by the federal government
So I'm jammin' frequencies in your brain when you speak to me
Technique’ll rip a rapper to pieces indecently
Pack weapons illegally, 'cause I'm never hesitant
Sniper-scopin' a commission controllin' the president
Father, forgive them, for they don't know right from wrong
The truth’ll set you free, written down in this song
And the song has the cause of death written in code
The word of God brought to life, that'll save your soul
Save your soul, motherfucker, save your soul
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I hacked the Pentagon for self-incriminating evidence
Of Republican-manufactured white powder pestilence
Marines Corps flak vest, with the guns and ammo
Spittin' bars like a demon stuck inside a piano
Turn a Sambo into a soldier, with just one line
So here's the truth about the system that'll fuck up your mind
They gave al-Qaeda six billion dollars in 1989 to 1992
And now the last chapters of Revelations are comin' true
And I know a lot of people find it hard to swallow this
'Cause subliminal bigotry makes you hate my politics
But you act like America wouldn't destroy two buildings
In a country that was sponsoring bombs dropped on our children
I was watchin' the towers, and though I wasn't the closest
I saw them crumble to the earth like they were full of explosives
And they thought nobody noticed the news report that they did
About the bombs planted on the George Washington Bridge
Four non-Arabs arrested during the emergency
And then it disappeared from the news permanently
They dubbed a tape of Osama, and they said it was proof
Jealous of our freedom? I can't believe you bought that excuse!
Rockin' a motherfuckin' flag don't make you a hero
Word to Ground Zero
The Devil crept into Heaven, God overslept on the seventh
The New World Order was born on September 11th
Father, forgive them, for they don't know right from wrong
The truth’ll set you free, written down in this song
And the song has the cause of death written in code
The word of God brought to life, that'll save your soul
Save your soul, motherfucker, save your soul

And just so conservatives don't take it to heart
I don't think Bush did it, 'cause he isn't that smart
He's just a stupid puppet takin' orders on his cell phone
From the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone
The military industry got it poppin' and lockin'
Lookin' for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine
And as a matter of fact, Rumsfeld, now that I think back
Without 9/11, you couldn't have a war in Iraq
Or a defense budget of world conquest proportions
Kill freedom of speech and revoke the right to abortion
Tax cut extortion, a blessing to the wealthy and wicked
But you still have to answer to the Armageddon you scripted
And Dick Cheney, you fuckin' leech, tell ‘em your plans
About building your pipelines through Afghanistan
And how Israeli troops trained the Taliban in Pakistan
You might have some house niggas fooled, but I understand
Colonialism is sponsored by corporations
That's why Halliburton gets paid to rebuild nations
Tell me the truth, I don't scare into paralysis
I know the CIA saw bin Laden on dialysis
In '98 when he was top ten for the FBI
Government ties is really why the government lies
Read it yourself instead of askin' the government why
'Cause then the cause of death'll cause the propaganda to die
Father
Forgive them

He is scheduled for 60 Minutes next. He’s going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television. People everywhere are starting to listen to him. It's embarrassing—13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

They told me I would never make it, I would never achieve it
Reality is nourishment, but people don't believe it
I guess it's hard to stomach the truth like a bulimic
It's a dirty game and nobody is willin' to clean it
But this is for the paraplegic people dreamin' of runnin'
Ladies married to men who don't please 'em, dreamin' of comin'
Verbally murderous like David Berkowitz when I'm gunnin'
Some cowards on the Internet didn't think I would sell
Scared to talk shit in person 'cause they stuck in a shell
And couldn't understand the pain of bein' stuck in a cell
Hell is not a place you go if you're not a Christian
It's the failure of your life's greatest ambition
It's a bad decision to blindly follow any religion
I don't see the difference in between the wrong and the wrong
Soldiers emptyin' the clips at little kids and they moms
Are just like a desperate motherfucker strapped to a bomb
Humanity's gone, smoked up in a gravity bong
By a Democrat-Republican Cheech and Chong
Immortal Technique, you never heard me preach in a song
I'm not controversial, I'm just speakin' the facts
Put your hands in the air like you got the heat to your back
And shake your body like a baby born addicted to crack
And since life's a gamble like the craps tables at Vegas
I freestyle my destiny, it's not written in pages

I hate it when they tell us how far we came to be
As if our people's history started with slavery
Painfully I discovered the shit they kept a secret
This is the exodus, like the black Jews out of Egypt
I keep it reality based with the music I make
Blow up the truth in your face with the style I run with
Like the Navy missile that shot down Flight 800
I'm like the Africans who came here before Columbus
And from the 1500s until after the morrow
I watched Latin America get raped in the sorrow
You see, the Spaniards never left después de Colon
And if you don't believe me, you can click on Univision
I never seen so much racism in all of my life
Every program and newscast, all of 'em white
It's like apartheid with 10 percent rulin' the rest
That type of stress'll make me put the fuckin' tool to your chest
Step in my way, nigga, I wouldn't wanna be ya
I burn slow like pissin' drunk with gonorrhea
I'll do a free show in North Korea, burnin' the flag
While J. Edgar Hoover politicians dress up in drag
Tryna confuse you, makin' it hard to follow this:
Capitalism and democracy are not synonymous
You swallow propaganda like a birth control pill
Sellin' your soul to the eye on the back of the dollar bill
But that'll never be me 'cause I'm leavin' the past
Like an abused wife with the kids, leavin' your ass
Like a drug addict clean and sober, leavin' the stash
Unbreakable Technique, leavin' the plane crash
I'm out with the black box and I refuse to return
I spit reality instead of what you usually learn
And I refuse to be concerned with condescending advice
'Cause I'm the only motherfucker that could change my life

Some people think I won't make it, but I know that I will
Escape the emptiness 'cause that shit is slow and it kills
The flow and the skill, I made y'all believe it at last
You can make the future, but it starts with leavin' the past

Most of my Latino and black people who are struggling to get food, clothes and shelter in the hood are so concerned with that, that philosophising about freedom and socialist democracy is usually unfortunately beyond their rationale. They don't realize that America can't exist without separating them from their identity, because if we had some sense of who we really are, there's no way in hell we'd allow this country to push it's genocidal consensus on our homelands. This ignorance exists, but it can be destroyed
Niggas talk about change and working within the system to achieve that. The problem with always being a conformist is that when you try to change the system from within, it's not you who changes the system; it's the system that will eventually change you. There is usually nothing wrong with compromise in a situation, but compromising yourself in a situation is another story completely, and I have seen this happen long enough in the few years that I've been alive to know that it's a serious problem. Latino America is a huge colony of countries whose presidents are cowards in the face of economic imperialism. You see, third world countries are rich places, abundant in resources, and many of these countries have the capacity to feed their starving people and the children we always see digging for food in trash on commercials. But plutocracies, in other words a government run by the rich such as this one and traditionally oppressive European states, force the third world into buying overpriced, unnecessary goods while exporting huge portions of their natural resources
I'm quite sure that people will look upon my attitude and sentiments and look for hypocrisy and hatred in my words. My revolution is born out of love for my people, not hatred for others
You see, most of Latinos are here because of the great inflation that was caused by American companies in Latin America. Aside from that, many are seeking a life away from the puppet democracies that were funded by the United States; places like El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Colombia, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Republica Dominicana, and not just Spanish-speaking countries either, but Haiti and Jamaica as well
As different as we have been taught to look at each other by colonial society, we are in the same struggle and until we realize that, we'll be fighting for scraps from the table of a system that has kept us subservient instead of being self-determined. And that's why we have no control over when the embargo will stop in Cuba, or when the bombs will stop dropping in Vieques
But you see, here in America the attitude that is fed to us is that outside of America there live lesser people. "Fuck them, let them fend for themselves." No, fuck you, they are you. No matter how much you want to dye your hair blonde and put fake eyes in, or follow an anorexic standard of beauty, or no matter how many diamonds you buy from people who exploit your own brutally to get them, no matter what kind of car you drive or what kind of fancy clothes you put on, you will never be them. They're always gonna look at you as nothing but a little monkey. I'd rather be proud of what I am, rather than desperately trying to be something I'm really not, just to fit in. And whether we want to accept it or not, that's what this culture or lack of culture is feeding us
I want a better life for my family and for my children, but it doesn't have to be at the expense of millions of lives in my homeland. We're given the idea that if we didn't have these people to exploit then America wouldn't be rich enough to let us have these little petty material things in our lives and basic standards of living. No, that's wrong. It's the business giants and the government officials who make all the real money. We have whatever they kick down to us. My enemy is not the average white man, it's not the kid down the block or the kids I see on the street; my enemy is the white man I don't see: the people in the white house, the corporate monopoly owners, fake liberal politicians those are my enemies. The generals of the armies that are mostly conservatives those are the real motherfuckers that I need to bring it to, not the poor, broke country-ass soldier that's too stupid to know shit about the way things are set up
In fact, I have more in common with most working and middle-class white people than I do with most rich black and Latino people. As much as racism bleeds America, we need to understand that classism is the real issue. Many of us are in the same boat and it's sinking, while these bougie motherfuckers ride on a luxury liner, and as long as we keep fighting over kicking people out of the little boat we're all in, we're gonna miss an opportunity to gain a better standard of living as a whole
In other words, I don't want to escape the plantation I want to come back, free all my people, hang the motherfucker that kept me there and burn the house to the god damn ground. I want to take over the encomienda and give it back to the people who work the land
You cannot change the past but you can make the future, and anyone who tells you different is a fucking lethargic devil. I don't look at a few token Latinos and black people in the public eye as some type of achievement for my people as a whole. Most of those successful individuals are sell-outs and house-negros
But, I don't consider brothers a sell-out if they move out of the ghetto. Poverty has nothing to do with our people. It's not in our culture to be poor. That's only been the last 500 years of our history; look at the last 2000 years of our existence and what we brought to the world in terms of science, mathematics, agriculture, and forms of government. You know the idea of a confederation of provinces where one federal government controls the states? The Europeans who came to this country stole that idea from the Iroquois League. The idea of impeaching a ruler comes from an Aztec tradition. That's why Montezuma was stoned to death by his own people cause he represented the agenda of White Spaniards once he was captured. Not the Aztec people who would become Mexicans
So in conclusion, I'm not gonna vote for anybody just cause they Black or Latino. They have to truly represent the community and represent what's good for all of us proletariat

The day of the geechee is gone boy
And you goin' with it
Yeah, nigga
Immortal Technique
Metaphysics

The bling-bling era was cute but it's about to be done
I leave you full of clips like the Moon blocking the Sun
My metaphors are dirty like herpes but harder to catch
Like an escape tunnel in prison, I started from scratch
And now these parasites want a percent of my ASCAP
Trying to control perspective like an acid flashback
But here's a quotable for every single record exec
"Get your fucking hands out my pocket, nigga!" like Malcolm X
But this ain’t a movie, I'm not a fan or a groupie and I'm not
The type of cat you can afford to miss if you shoot me
Curse the Heavens and laugh when the sky electrocutes me
Immortal Technique stuck in your thoughts, darkening dreams
No one's as good as me—they just got better marketing schemes
I'll lead you to your own destruction like sparking a fiend
'Cause you got jealousy in your voice like Starscream
And that's the primary reason that I hate y'all faggots
I've been nice since niggas got killed over 8-ball jackets
And Reebok Pumps that didn't do shit for the sneaker
I'm a heatseaker with features that'll reach through the speaker
And murder counter-revolutionaries personally
Break a thermometer and force-feed his kids mercury
A&R's tried jerking me, thinking they call shots
Offered me a deal and a blanket full of smallpox
You're all getting shot, you little fucking treacherous bitches!
This is the business, and y'all ain’t getting nothing for free
And if you devils play broke, then I'm taking your company
You could call it reparations or restitution
Lock and load, nigga.  Industrial revolution

I want fifty-three million dollars for my calloused hands
Like the Bush administration gave to the Taliban
And fuck packing grams, nigga, learn to speak and behave!
You want to spend twenty years as a government slave?
Two million people in prison keep the government paid
Stuck in a six-by-eight cell, alive in the grave
I was made by revolution to speak to the masses
Deep in the club, toast the truth.  Reach for your glasses
I'll burn an orphanage just to bring heat to you bastards
Innocent deep in a casket—Colombian fashion
Intoxicated off the flow like thug's passion
You motherfuckers will never get me to stop blasting
You're better off asking Ariel Sharon for compassion
You're better off begging for twenty points from a label
You're better off battling cancer under telephone cables
Technique chemically unstable, set to explode
Foretold by the dead sea scrolls written in code
So if your message ain’t shit, fuck the records you sold!
'Cause if you go platinum, it's got nothing to do with luck
It just means that a million people are stupid as fuck
Stuck in the underground, a general that rose to the limit
Without distribution managers, a deal, or a gimmick
Revolutionary Volume 2 murder the critics
And leave your fucking body rotting for the roaches and crickets
This is the business, and y'all ain’t getting nothing for free
And if you devils play broke, then I'm taking your company
You could call it reparations or restitution
Lock and load, nigga.  Industrial revolution6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Man, you hear this bullshit they be talking
Every day, man
It's like these motherfuckers is just like professional liars
You know what I'm sayin'? It's wild
Listen

Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you, nigga
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga
Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you, nigga
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers

I pledge no allegiance, nigga, fuck the President's speeches!
I'm baptized by America and covered in leeches
The dirty water that bleaches your soul and your facial features
Drownin' you in propaganda that they spit through the speakers
And if you speak about the evil that the government does
The Patriot Act'll track you to the type of your blood
They try to frame you and say you was tryna sell drugs
And throw a federal indictment on niggas to show you love
This shit is run by fake Christians, fake politicians
Look at they mansions, and look at the conditions you live in
All they talk about is terrorism on television
They tell you to listen, but they don't really tell you they mission
They funded al-Qaeda, and now they blame the Muslim religion
Even though Bin Laden was a CIA tactician
They gave him billions of dollars and they funded his purpose
Fahrenheit 9/11? That's just scratchin' the surface
Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you, nigga
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga
Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you, nigga
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers

They say the rebels in Iraq still fight for Saddam
But that's bullshit, I'll show you why it's totally wrong
'Cause if another country invaded the hood tonight
It'd be warfare through Harlem and Washington Heights
I wouldn't be fightin' for Bush or White America's dream
I'd be fightin' for my people's survival and self-esteem
I wouldn't fight for racist churches from the South, my nigga
I'd be fightin' to keep the occupation out, my nigga
You ever clock someone who talk shit or look at you wrong?
Imagine if they shot at you and was rapin' your moms
And of course Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons
We sold him that shit after Ronald Reagan's election
Mercenary contractors fightin' a new era
Corporate military bankin' off the war on terror
They controllin' the ghetto with the fear of attack
Tryin' to distract the fact that they engineerin' the crack
So I'm strapped like Lee Malvo, holdin' a sniper rifle
These bullets will touch your kids, and I don't mean like Michael
Your body be sent to the morgue, stripped down and recycled
I fire on house niggas that support you and like you
'Cause innocent people get murdered in the struggle daily
And poor people never get shit and struggle daily
This ain't no alien conspiracy theory, this shit is real
Written on the dollar underneath the Masonic seal
I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President dead
It's never been said, but I set precedents

Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you, nigga
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga
Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects

"I've heard whispers... about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry"

"Well, the irony of this, of course, is that this money, which is in the billions, is coming from your country. You see, you are the major purchaser of our national product, which is, of course, cocaína."

"Cocaine. On one hand, you're saying the United States government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the same time, we are doing business with the very same government that is flooding our streets with cocaine?"

"Mm, mm, si, si. Let me show you a few of the other characters that are involved in this... tragicomedy."
"Oigan ustedes ahi! Ustedes trabajando! Sigan trabajando carajo!"
"Oye Luis, ¿Cuándo van a terminar?"
"Ahorita."
"Bueno que se apuren los burros. Ahorita viene el camión, apúra, diles!"
"Ahorita van a venir para recoger los productos, apúrate!"

I'm on the border of Bolivia, working for pennies
Treated like a slave, the coca fields have to be ready
The spirit of my people is starving, broken and sweaty
Dreaming about revolution ("¡Revolucion!") looking at my machete
But the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms
And if I ran away, I know they'd probably murder my moms
So I pray to Jesú Cristo when I go to the mission
Process the cocaine paste and play my position
Ok, listen, Juan Valdez, just get me my product
Before we chop off your hands for worker's misconduct
I got the power to shoot a copper and not get charged
And it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad
So, to feed your kids I need these bricks
Forty tons in total, let me test it, indeed, I... 
Shit, this is good, pass me a tissue
And don't worry about them, I paid off the official

Yo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of some of the foulest
Elected by my people, the only one on the ballot
Born and bred to consult with feds, I laugh at fate
And assassinate my predecessor to have his place
In a Third World fascist state, lock the nation
With 90% of the wealth in 10% of the population
The Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully
The finest type of China white and cocaine, you'll see
Honey, I'm home
Never mind why your bank account's suddenly grown, it's (What?)
Funny we're so out of this debt from this money we owe, would you
Run if I told you that I had two governments overthrown
To keep our son enrolled in a private school and to keep our tummies swollen? (Whoa)
Come on, our fucking home was built on a foundation of bloody throats
The hungry stolen of their souls, of course this country's running coke
I took a stunted oath to hush the ones who know
The CIA conducts the flow for these young hustlers that lust for dough
I don't work in the hood.  Hit my connect.  That’s
What's really good.  They supply work to the hood
These dudes fucking crack me up
Scrutinized like we inferior.  Petrified when we meet in my area (Calm down)
My dudes don’t shoot until I say so.  You got the loot?
Give me the "Yay-Yay!" like Ice Cube, so don't play with
My llello
We won't stop for you bastards
My street scramblers chop it and bag it

Taking pictures and tapping phones
Debating snitches and cracking codes
Fast to cuff or blast the fo'
On any hustler stacking dough (Get on the ground)
There’s probably crack or blow
And my overtime is where your taxes go
I’ll gain your trust
Get you to hand weight to us ‘cause we paid up front
On the low with cameras taping ya
Getting popped with weight? The prison sentence is due
Make the call and then leave with two kis out the evidence room

With my fame, truck, boat, or plane, they watching you
You think you got work? They copping too
We control blocks, they lock countries and own companies
We had nice cars and sneaker money
Now there's players out there talkin' 'bout they holding
With bugs in their house like they down South with windows open
Your dough ain't long—you wrong—you take shorts and soon
Feds’ll be up in your mouth like forks and spoons
So enjoy the rush, live plush off coke bread
Soon you'll be in a cell with me like Jenny Lopez
In a school, I was a bully, now life is fully a joke
I keep afloat on a boat for Peruvian coke
Players do favors for governors and tax makers
Fat Quakers smoke crack and sex acts with bad mayors
The walls got ears, you bigmouths probably scared
Not prepared to do years like Javier
The story just told is an example of the path that drugs take on their way to every neighborhood, in every state, of this country. It's a lot deeper than the niggas on your block. So when they point the finger at you, brother man? This is what you've got to tell them

"I'm not guilty. You're the one that's guilty. The lawmakers, the politicians, the Columbian drug lords... all you who lobby against making drugs legal, just like you did with alcohol during the prohibition! You're the one who's guilty. I mean, c'mon, let's kick the ballistics here: ain't no Uzis made in Harlem! Not one of us in here owns a poppy field! This thing is bigger than Immortal Technique. This is big business. This is the American way."12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You get up and howl about America and democracy
There is no America, there is no democracy
We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies
The world is a college of corporations
Inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business
The world is a business
And I have chosen you to preach this evangel

For all my free market, health care-robbing
Stock-stealing, retirement fund fuckin'-with niggas
Fuck you little credit card-scamming, jewelry-stealing
Crack-selling, liquor store-robbing motherfuckers!
Shout out to the homies Carnegie, OG Willy Randolph Hearst, Farouk, Rockefeller – the real Rockefeller
My main bitch Leona, pour out a little Louis the 13th
Scott Rothstein, Jack Abramoff, hold ya head
My Rothschild niggas: Let's get this money!

I spend my day pairin' America overseas
Pension for the workers, nigga please
Embezzlement etiquette, private settlement
I'm better with confederate rhetoric
From my mansion in Connecticut
Foreclose, evict hoes out of tenement
I twist words like a speech impediment
I hope you got good credit, bitch
If not, better get a new job with benefits
While I play golf with niggas I get cheddar with
New money buys brand new carats
My old money bought your great grandparents
You got grills in your mouth, I ain't mad at ya
I own every goldmine in South Africa
Thanks, baby, you made me a billion
Plus I own a building
For each one of my children's children; that's the shit
Snort coke in the whip, Miss USA suckin' my dick
Yeah, what! Fuck the law, ‘cause real jail is for suckas
I go to country club prison, you dumb motherfuckers
(I am the 1 percent, fuckin' bitch!)
You know my CEO, corporate steeze, please
Overthrow governments overseas in a breeze
Politicians in my pockets for a few hundred G's
So if I'm ever in court, my assets'll never freeze

I got a job and a house and a bank account
When I'm out, I doubt that's something you can say
And if not then I'll fake death like Kenneth Lay
Make money everyday the world burns on its axis
While y'all strugglin' to pay taxes
I'm gettin' my money the fastest
Memos and faxes, shredded up documents
Slush funds through the corrupt continents
But they don't want me indicted
‘Cause they don't want my dirty laundry aired when I fight it
Don't get my lawyers excited
‘Cause what good is a law if you can't rewrite it?
I got CIA traitors, dictators
So fuck y'all whistleblowers and haters!
(Sheeeiiitt!) I'll invest money from al-Qaeda
In the bank 9/11 widows go to later
Capitalism's who I pray to, fuck the state of the world
Money talks, so what the fuck I need to say to your girl?
(I don't pay them to fuck, I pay them to leave!)
You know my CEO, corporate steeze, greed
I treat countries like the IMF, down on your knees
Real gangstas run the world, fuck what you believe
I'll cut down a forest while you niggas burnin' some trees
I'll get your family murdered for a couple of G's
‘Cause your working class money ain't fuckin' with me
You think rappers are rich ‘cause of songs you heard?
My labels make the money and haven't rapped a fuckin' word

Yacht in the ocean, coastin' with the sails out
Hey, America, thanks for the bailouts
I made off with the Banco Ambrosiano
Got away scott-free like El Vaticano
Activists act a bitch, get mad at me
‘Cause of my tax-free charity
80 percent to the staff and company
And 20 percent to the homeless and hungry
The country gotta pay the Fed Reserve
Kick back to the banksters—haven't you learned?
You protest cops or patrols on the street
But I bought city hall, so I own the police
Email, Facebook, and the shit you tweet
All the phone companies, so I heard you speak
And my suggestion is your correction
No elections, sex with no affection
No invention will benefit the world of man
Will exist 'til I've got the money in my hand
World Bank interest rate damn rape on the spot
But I'm a gangsta, you gon' take my money, like it or not, nigga
(I got your country in my pocket, motherfucker!)
You know my CEO, masonic steeze, cheese
Only little people pay all these taxes and fees
Since you were born, we've controlled what you watch and you read
And pretty soon we're gonna own the fuckin' air that you breathe
I take what I want, fucker, I don't have to say please
I convince you that it's good for you, take it and leave
You think presidents are a face of a nation?
I put 'em all where they are, end of the conversation14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah, Harlem streets stay flooded in white powder
Like those motherfuckers runnin' away from the Twin Towers
Gunshots rock the Earth like a meteor shower
Bowlin' For Columbine, fear givin' the media power
Innocence devoured like a chicken spot snack box
Government cocaine cooked into ghetto crack rock
Corrupt cops' false testimony at your arraignment
Check to check, constant struggle to make the payments
Workin' your whole life, wonderin' where the day went
The subway stays packed like a multi-cultural slave ship
It's rush hour, 2:30 to 8, non stoppin'
And people comin' home after corporate sharecroppin'
And fuck flossin'! Mothers are tryin' to feed children
But gentrification is kickin' them out of their buildin'
A generation of babies born without healthcare
Families homeless, thrown the fuck off the welfare

"Homicide Harlem—blaow! What's the problem?"
"Homicide Harlem—blaow! What's the problem?"
"Homicide Harlem—blaow! What's the problem?"
"Homicide Harlem—blaow! What's the problem?"

It's like Cambodia, "The Killing Fields" uptown
We live in distress and hang the flag upside down
The sound of conservative politicians on television
People in the hood are blind, so they tell us to listen
They vote for us to go to war instantly
But none of their kids serve in the infantry
The odds are stacked against us, like a casino
Think about it: most of the Army is black and Latino
And if you can't acknowledge the reality of my words
You just another stupid motherfucker out on the curb
Tryin' to escape from the ghetto with your ignorant ways
But you can't read history at an illiterate stage
And you can't raise a family on minimum wage
Why the fuck you think most of us are locked in a cage?
I give niggas the truth, 'cause their pride is indigent
You better off rich and guilty than poor and innocent
But I'm sick of feelin' impotent watchin' the world burn
In the era of apocalypse, waitin' my turn
I'm a Harlem nigga that's concerned with the future
And if you're in my way it'd be an honor to shoot ya
Uproot ya with the evil that grows in my people
Makin' them deceitful, cannibalistic, and lethal
But I see through the mentality implanted in us
And I educate my fam about who we should trust
"Homicide Harlem—blaow! What's the problem?"
"Homicide Harlem—blaow! What's the problem?"
"Homicide Harlem—blaow! What's the problem?"
"Homicide Harlem—blaow! What's the problem?"
"—blaow!"13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I’m from where the gold and diamonds are ripped from the earth
Right next to the slave castles where the water is cursed
From where police brutality is not half as nice
It makes the hood in America look like paradise
Compared to the AIDS-infested Caribbean slum
African streets where the passport's an American gun
From where they massacre people and try to keep it quiet
And spend the next 25 years tryin' to deny it
I’m from where they cut the hands off if you make a fist
And niggas grow coca, 'cause the job market doesn’t exist
Except slave labor, modern-day company store
And peacekeepers don’t ever ever ever come here no more
From where the bombs that they used to drop on Vietnam
Still has children born deformed, eight months before they gone
I’m from where they lost the true meaning of the Quran
'Cause heroin is not compatible with Islam
And niggas know that but grow that poppy seed anyway
'Cause that food-drop parachute does not come every day
I’m from where people pray to the gods of their conquerors
And practically every president's a money launderer
From where the only place democracy's acceptable
Is if America's candidate is electable
And they might even have a black president, but he’s useless
'Cause he does not control the economy, stupid!
Lock and load your gun where I'm from, the Third World, son
Been to many places, but I’m Third World born
Guerrillas hit and run where I'm from, the Third World, son
You polluted everything and now the Third World’s gone
The water is poison where I'm from, the Third World, son
700 children died by the end of this song
Revolution'll come where I'm from, the Third World, son
Constant occupation leaves the Third World torn

I’m from where the Catholic Church is some racist shit
They helped Europe and America rape this bitch
They pray to white Spanish Jesus, who’s face is this?
But never talk about the black pope Gelasius
I’m from where Soviet weapons still decide elections
Military's like the Mafia: you pay for protection
Catamite sex tours is what the country sells
And rich white businessmen make the best clientèle
I’m from where they too pussy to come film Survivor
And they murder Coca-Cola union organisers
I’m from where the justice system está podrido
Fuck government, niggas politic over perico
Rebelde conocido, enterado vivo
Como otro Argentino desaparecido
'Cause RICO laws don’t apply to the CIA
And motherfuckers make sneakers for a quarter a day
I’m from where they overthrow democratic leaders
Not for the people but for the Wall Street Journal readers
From where blacks, indigenous peoples, and Asians
Were once slaves of the Caucasians
And it’s amazin' how they trained them
To be racist against themselves in the place they was raised in
You kept us caged in
Destroyed our culture and said that you civilised us
Raped our women, and when we were born you despised us
Gentrified us, agent provocateur divide us
And crucified every revolutionary messiah
So I'm a start a global riot
That not even your fake anti-Communist dictators can keep quiet
Fuck your charity medicine tryin' to murder me!
The immunisations you gave us were full of mercury
So now I see the Third World like the rap game, soldier
Nationalize the industry and take it over!
Lock and load your gun where I'm from, the Third World, son
Been to many places, but I’m Third World born
Guerrillas hit and run where I'm from, the Third World, son
You polluted everything and now the Third World’s gone
The water is poison where I'm from, the Third World, son
700 children died by the end of this song
Revolution'll come where I'm from, the Third World, son
Constant occupation leaves the Third World torn13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

They say the odds against me are crooked and impossible
Like I was born with a hole in my heart as an obstacle
I was left to die by the doctors in the Children's Hospital
But I never lose hope, success is psychological
The world is volatile and the street is my education
Shapin' the nation, like the blueprint of a Mason
While Shawshank record deals get you raped on occasion
So I'm focused on my economic situation
I'm like the little kids on TV that dig through the trash
I hustle regardless of the way you talk shit and laugh
A lot of niggas drop science, but they don't know the math
Because their mind is narrower than the righteous path
It's funny how on the block niggas will kill you for cash
But never raise the gun and cry out, "Freedom at last!"
The cold war is over, but the world is still gettin' colder
Atlas walkin' through the projects, with the hood on my shoulders
I would like to raise my children to grow to be soldiers
But then a general will decide when their life would be over
So I work hard until my personality's split
Like the Black Panthers, into the Bloods and the Crips
They said I would never be shit, but now I sit and reminisce
Like Yeshua ben Yusef flippin' through Genesis
Ignorance is venomous, and it murders the soul
Spreadin' like a virus, runnin' rampant, out of control
So if I should ever fall and get caught in the hustle
Let them know that I died while I fought in a struggle
From the hoodrats to the rich kids lost in a bubble
Spray paintin' on the streets and at the subway tunnels
Write it down and remember that we never gave in
The mind of a child is where the revolution begins
So if the solution has never been to look in yourself
How is it that you expect to find it anywhere else?

Immortal Technique in the streets, back on the hustle
‘Cause three strikes will get you life for stuffin' cracks in a duffle
Upstate, behind steel gates, attacked in a scuffle
Razor blades stuck on the side of pencils
Hacked through your muscle
But the emptiness is what bleeds you to death when it cuts you
And it's the lawyers, not the inmates, schemin' to fuck you
Tryna fight the system from inside eventually corrupts you
But that's what you get when you put a corporation above you
And it's the people that love you that seem to hurt you the most
Sometimes when they die, you find yourself cursin' their ghost
But you make success, nobody delivers your fate
Sometimes you give and you take
Since prehistoric vertebrates crawled out of the lakes
And that's the truth about life
Or to do it to ghetto and your car, rims, and your ice
Because even though we survived
Through the struggle that made us
We still look at ourselves through the eyes of people that hate us
But I'm going to make it regardless of the trumped up charges
And semi-automatic barrages that empty the cartridge
Post-traumatically scarred kids that try to be brave
Because niggas backstab each other just to try to get paid
Turn cannibal, like knights during the crusades
Afraid of responsibility, addicted to greed
Beatin' their girl, purposefully losin' a seed
As if we were bound to the destiny we used to receive
So if I should ever fall and get caught in the hustle
Let them know that I died while I fought in a struggle
From the hoodrats to the rich kids lost in a bubble
Spray paintin' on the streets and at the subway tunnels
Write it down and remember that we never gave in
The mind of a child is where the revolution begins
So if the solution has never been to look in yourself
How is it that you expect to find it anywhere else?

I used to wonder about people who don't believe in themselves
But then I saw the way they portrayed us to everyone else
They cursed us to only see the worst in ourselves
Blind to the fact the whole time we were hurtin' ourselves
I used to wonder about people who don't believe in themselves
But then I saw the way they portrayed us to everyone else
They cursed us to only see the worst in ourselves
Blind to the fact the whole time we were hurtin' ourselves
I used to wonder… {*echo*}10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Like anybody, I would like to live — a long life; longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over. And I’ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land. So I’m happy, tonight. I’m not worried about anything. I’m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord

The ghetto is like a prison with invisible bars
No matter where you at, it always follows you where you are
And it's hard out there for a pimp to get out of
But it's harder for the hooker that he beat the shit out of
I got niggas underground in the Confederate states
Ironically running from slavery that prison creates
So I never hate on the South: I respect their vision
I just hate on niggas that promote Samboism
And white execs that love to see us in that position
They reflect the stereotypes of America's vision
They want us dancing, cooning and hollering
Only respect us for playing sports and modeling
More than racism: it's stay in your place-ism
More people are trapped in practical blackface-ism
So fuck a Civil War between the North and the South
It's between field niggas and slaves that are stuck in the house

Civil war for the soul of a nation
This is a struggle to save civilization
Demonstrations overthrowing the occupation
The annihilation of mental colonization
Civil war for the soul of a nation
We fight for the future of our civilization
Destroy the corrupt government organizations
Trying to survive cultural assassination
Crip niggas, Blood niggas, eses, Asians
Why the fuck we warring with each other's population?
The devil wanna dead all our population
People and Folk Nation, why the separation?
Why we got Jamaicans hating on Hatians
When the British and French raped both nations?
Mexicans and Blacks kill each other, straight hating
While the government profits from prison population
If you on the bottom, be you Anglo or Asian
You gotta recognize the realness of what I'm saying
You gotta recognize another G ain't the enemy
When the police ride, and kill us frequently
We gotta make the youth see where the truth be
If you a G, then grow and develop GD
50 years of gangs and our people still poor
If we really run the streets, we should really end war

Civil war for the soul of a nation
This is a struggle to save civilization
Demonstrations overthrowing the occupation
The annihilation of mental colonization
Civil war for the soul of a nation
We fight for the future of our civilization
Destroy the corrupt government organizations
Trying to survive cultural assassination
Our hearts were torn apart just like y'all was
Watching towers full of souls fall to sawdust
Everytime we called your office you ignored us
Now you holding hearings on us all inside of Congress
Microscopes on us, ask if we're jihadists
My answer was in line with all of the Founding Fathers
I think Patrick said it best: Give me liberty or death
I shall never accept anything less
You claim innocence, you play victimless
But you gave the kiss of death in the name of self-defense
Slavery and theft have brought our nations to the end
Of pacifying your citizenry with excess
We believe in freedom, justice, security
But they're only pure when they're applied universally
So certainly if I rage against the machine
My aim was only to clean the germs out of the circuitry
Urgently putting fear inside your heart
Make you burn Qu'rans and tell me not to build a mosque
Me, my wife and babies we ain't never made jihad
We just want to touch our heads to the floor and talk to god
Ask him to remove every blemish from our heart
The greatest threat of harm doesn't come from any bomb
The moment you refuse the human rights for just a few
What happens when that few includes you? Civil war10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"I am content to die for my beliefs
So cut off my head and make me a martyr!
The people will always remember it."
"No, they will forget."
A man who walks with God can walk anywhere
Hence I fear nothing

The point of guerilla war is not to succeed
It's always been just to make the enemy bleed
Deprivin' the soldiers of the peace of mind that they need
Bullets are hard to telegraph when they bob and they weave
The only way a guerilla war can ever be over
Is when the occupation can't afford more soldiers
Until they have to draft the last of you into the service
And you refuse because you don't see the purpose
The only way to counter the insurgents that are well-equipped
Is to paint the people fightin' for freedom as "terrorists"
Then find a faction, lookin' for foreign investment
Install them in power and murder any objections
You can't stop a revolution from breathin'
So to beat 'em, they offer people the illusion of freedom
But when you're done dreamin' and wake up tortured for treason
Then you can see them, hidin' behind the god they believe in
Deep in the trenches, in the heart of a war
That's the place a martyr is born (Motherfucker, it's on!)
During the night before the start of the dawn
That's the place a martyr is born (Motherfucker, it's on!)
When gunshots are raining in the heart of a storm
That's the place a martyr is born (Motherfucker, it's on!)
Guerilla war when the army is gone
That's the place a martyr is born (Motherfucker, it's on!)

The purpose of life is a life with a purpose
So I'd rather die for a cause than live a life that is worthless
I don't need the circus or the day of national observance
I need you to think for you and stop bein' a servant
Pawns only move a square in the game that they're used in
And realize it too late, like the shooting of Huey Newton
Or Patrice Lumumba and Salvador Allende
Slaughtered by the power-hungry branches of their own gente
Ghandi wasn't killed by Pakistani nationals
He was assassinated by a Hindu radical
And Che Guevara, rebel to a U.S. continent
Was sold to the C.I.A. by Bolivian communists
Wasn’t Yitzhak Rabin murdered by a Zionist?
And Anwar Sadat a victim of the same violence?
Malcolm X was seen as a threat to the F.B.I.
But to blast ‘em they used Muslims from the N.O.I.
Even the 35th President of the Republic
Was murdered by factions of his own government
So now that it’s proven, that a soldier of revolution
Or head of an empire, disguised in a constitution
Can not escape the retribution or manipulation
Of the self-appointed rulers of the planet's corporations
So I'ma need every generation to put your hands up
‘Cause you can only get ‘em off your back when you stand up
Deep in the trenches, in the heart of a war
That's the place a martyr is born (Motherfucker, it's on!)
During the night before the start of the dawn
That's the place a martyr is born (Motherfucker, it's on!)
When gunshots are raining in the heart of a storm
That's the place a martyr is born (Motherfucker, it's on!)
Guerilla war when the army is gone
That's the place a martyr is born (Motherfucker, it's on!)

I was a man blessed by God
To survive some of the worst circumstances
I had many things: a beautiful woman I loved, a home, money
And I gave it all up to bleed and to die free
Sometimes I look back on that life
And I wonder what it would've been like
And in moments of weakness I think about trading it
Then I snap the fuck out of it and I get back to my reality
And I realize that I'm in the heart of a war
And that's the place a martyr is born7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yo, in a hundred years from now
Everyone who's living on this planet will be dead
So it's inconsequential really, all the shit that you talk
All the bullshit that you stand for
It's more important what, what you're ready to build
What you're ready to pass down to your children
What you're ready to create
You better fuckin' remember that
When you challenge a motherfucker like me
Remember, I'm the dominant species

I'm stuck inside the future and life is chaotic
The government is psychotically racist and robotic
The matrix of entrapment is socio-economic
Neurotic conspiracy theory becomes reality
Life is war, and every day's a battle to me
I'm on the brink of insanity
Between extreme intelligence and split personalities
But I elevate to the point of reversing gravity
Revolutionary conceptuality spittin' out of me
Even the dead people in my family tell me they proud of me
Stupidity's not allowed by me, ‘cause I don't got time to play
I'm the black hole lyricist that'll take your shine away
Darkness at any time of day
I'm the Technique and you're nobody so what you tryna say?
Stellar density becomes your physical alignment
1.8 billion tons per square inch confinement
I drop knowledge so heavy it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
I'm the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet

Yo, yo, lyrically I'm infinite, like possibilities
But you don't have the capability, like infertility
‘Cause opening your mouth to question my validity
Is like tryin' to contradict the theory of relativity
What I spit is the epitome of heavy artillery
My enemies are obsessed with me, like the bitch in Misery
But break out, like a father runnin' from responsibility
Every time I step and abuse the mic with versatility
I balance humility, with brutal instinct
I'll make your whole cypher look like those crackers from N'Sync
And I don't care about your link, or your luxury car
I shed light with more magnitude than all of the stars
La Brea Tar Pit thick, so don't ever talk shit
And remember somethin', nigga, while you rave and rant
A roach can live for nine days without its head, but you can't

I drop knowledge so heavy it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
I'm the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet
I'm explicit like video tapes of conjugal visits
Some niggas are too stupid to understand it, like astrophysics
Technique is exquisite, I'll make your thoughts a victory
Get pessimistic with the quickness
If you think that I will just become another statistic
With anything but success when I bless the mic as I spit this
Specifically prolific with Kaprosi’s sarcoma coma type sickness
My style is like a ten-year-old child with a slit wrist
Too much reality for the fuckin' hit list
I got a Black Panther mentality with a spic fist
So you can get dissed, even if you're locally gold
Vocally bold, or globally, multi-platinum sold
I'm emotionally cold, disciplined, and ready to kill
Like spirits in the same room with you, I'm givin' you chills
I drop knowledge while these motherfuckers clumsily spill

And I drop it so heavy, it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
I'm the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah
Haha
Se ha cabado la mierda
Bout to drop a def' cut
Yo, yo, yo, huh

Immortal Technique disintegrates mics when I spit
I cause more casualties than sunken slave ships
Full to capacity, I bring tragedy to rap without my man Khadafi
The government took Nazi scientists from Germany
To design nuclear rockets and ways of observin' me
'Cause their pathetic attempts didn't work to murder me
When this country was conceived, these bastards never heard of me
But now I hold the souls of slave masters eternally
Bleedin' internally, burgundy during surgery, verbally
'Cause I'm a spirit to which devils are incompatible
I've been around since the planet was inhabitable
I spit in the ocean and created microscopic animals
Which evolved into two species, the righteous and the cannibals
But until then, I had alien women suck me off
When God said ("Let there be light") I turned it the fuck off
And that's the reason Earth is only five-billion years old
I made the sun shine, and permitted time to unfold
The surface was lava, but when I stepped down, it became cold
Fuck what you've been told!
My spiritual form became a swarm of molecule sickness
Manifested liquid trapped inside a mountainous region
Until the sky started rainin', continuous seasons
Immortal Technique, at long last, reincarnated
Undebatably reinstated to leave you decapitated
Je suis fou, but my crazy words make sense
I'll split every pound in your body into six pence
I'm sick of simple similes about The Sixth Sense
I'll leave your body drenched in the blood from all your ancestors
You'll never be at peace, like the souls of child molesters
I'll cut you and bless your festerin' wounds with alcohol
Drown you in a clogged toilet, in a public bathroom stall
I'll rip you down, take a chunk of you home, like the Berlin Wall
This is the final call for all rappers that wanna brawl
Immortal Technique, the wrong motherfucker to diss
'Cause I allowed God to let you motherfuckers exist
Hahahahaha yeah, real oh
We about to crash somethin' now, yo
Yo, yo, yo

I'm the stronghold on your neck that doesn't let you breathe
Stronger than the fake image of God in which you believe
More dangerous than your ignorant ass could ever perceive
A European virus mutated in Africa, overseas
Transported by mosquitoes and fleas to where you live
So lock yourself in your house with your wife and your kids
You're such a bitch, somebody probably made you out of a rib
My arrest record just scratches the surface of what I did
My bid locked me up and brought my life to an end
I was forgotten, abandoned by my bitches and friends
You don't want beef with people like me, so don't pretend
I'll resurrect your aborted baby and kill it again
You get no props in hip-hop like feminine men
I'm iller than any plague God gave Moses to send
You wanna make amends 'cause I'm the reason that the earth shakes
Buryin' your fam like Central American earthquakes

Immortal Technique
Harlem to Canada
Lyrically damage ya
Te dije que se ha cabado la mierda6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Beware the beast man, for he is the Devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed. Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. Shun him; drive him back into his jungle lair, for he is the harbinger of death

Yeah! Immortal Technique! SP the Ghost! Poison Pen! Vinnie Paz!
We gonna stomp em out, run them out, run them out, call your number out, send your uncle Ruckus out
We gonna stomp em out, run them out, run them out, nigga ain’t nothing civilized about no uncle ??? nigga, you feel me? Don’t bring no uncle ??? out nigga, fuck outta here

All troops in formation? Let the siege commence!

Back like I was locked up, putting in work
Burning through books like Nazi's in a Catholic church
I'm cursed like Cain when he murdered his brother
Cut your face off and wear it while I'm fucking your mother
I'm Mars Ultor, the avenger, the god of war
And if you don't believe in me, I doubt you believe in God at all
I breathe smokeless fire, the Jinn type
That'll make you hate the way that Allah made you to live life
Like Hindu, niggas that be bleaching their skin white
Other people's teeth in my hands after a fist fight
I was born with a sixth sense and a swift right
Skinned werewolves and rape demons at midnight
Sell your kids into slavery after we murder you
Or sacrifice them in the same fire we burnin' you
Barbarian funeral, nigga, you wanna know?
Damn the river, bury me, and let the water flow
Chaos, mayhem, bang outs, slay them, uprise, rape them, raid them
Cage em, pandemonium, insurgent, death merchants, commit the best murder
Pillage, Kill them, erase history, make them a mystery

Cut the nose off, the ears off, the whole head
Immortal and Ghost coming, code red
You never seen a black barbarian
Warrior, warlord, pussy, cut your balls off
More bodies come, more bodies hauled off
What you want the sword and get shit sawed off
Your throat need an axe in it
And I'm breaking your back because your spine needed a crack in it
You bugging me, I'm coming to fumigate
The Wolverine, the Sabretooth, the way that I mutilate
I'm like the viking in Valhalla Rising
Except I got black skin and both of my eyes in
Don't test him, please don't stress him
He'll hang you from a tree with your own intestines
How you wanna die? Make your own suggestion
Now talk to the lord and make your own confession


You pussies living in a movie theatre
Put the motherfucking spell on you like brujeria
Chop his motherfucking head like a ruthless leader
Guns drawn in a church service, shoot the preacher
You need to be godly to know Allah
Ain't no rappers eating around me, like a broken jaw
It ain't ever been a day that I ain't broke the law
What you think I hold a motherfucking toaster for?
I ain't going there, there's police in that room
And Vinnie walk around with bags of dust like a vacuum
Bury you under the earth inside a black tomb
My body covered in Dashiki and stab wounds
I'm a guerilla, barbarians is my ancestors
That's a part of my neurological transmitters
We Islamic and brought the story of shem with us (Al hamdu Allah!)
While we brought the motherfucking blam blam with us

The walls have been breached! ANFALL!!!
We came in the name of peace and brotherhood, you wanted us bound in slavery, poisoned our water, changed our names...
Burn their homes, take their jewels, skin them alive!
Hold on, hold on, hold on...
No one will know these people ever existed, and all that will be left is what we build upon their ruins...4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
