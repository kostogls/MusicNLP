Or move as far as sold Michael Jackson 43 million
Shoot, errbody have the zipper jacket
And half of these thugs have the glove to match, ya feel me?
Yo, it's ok though, if you wanna be hard and ice grill
And Harlem Shake at the same time, whatever

Yo, yo yo move out of the way
We got Missy Elliott coming through
Girl that is Missy Elliott she lost a lot of weight
Girl I heard she eats one cracker a day
Oh well I heard the bitch was married to Tim and started fucking with Trina
I heard the bitch got hit with three zebras and a monkey
I can't stand the bitch no way

When I walk up in the piece
I ain't gotta even speak
I'm a bad mamajama
Goddammit, motherfucker, you ain't gotta like me
How you stuntin' these hoes
Need to talk, what you know
And stop talking 'bout who I'm sticking and licking
Just mad it ain't yours
I know y'all poor, y'all broke
Y'all job just hanging up clothes
Step to me, get burnt like toast
Motherfuckers, adios, amigos
Halves halves wholes wholes
I don't brag, I mostly boast
From the VA to the LA coast
Izzo kizzay, lezzy goh\
Millze cillzan sillzome plilzay dilzzouble dilzutch!

Izzall rizzight! Nizzow wizzee wilzzo-izzo-zee!

When I pull up in my whip
Bitches wanna talk shit
I'm driving, I'm glad and I'm styling
And these motherfuckers ask, "Did you see it?"
I'm gripping these curbs
SKRRT! Did ya heard?
I love 'em, my feathers, my furs, ahh!
I fly like a bird
Chickenheads on the prowl
Who you tryna fuck now?
Now you ain't getting loud
Better calm down 'fore I smack your ass down
I need my drums, bass high
Has to be my snare, strings, horns, yes
I need my Tim sound, right, left
Izzo kizzay, looky here

I don't go out my house, shorty, you just waiting to see
Who gon' roll up in the club and then report that next week
Just wanna see who I am fucking, boy sniffing some coke
I know by the time I finish this line, I'ma hear this on the radio

Yeah, uh huh, okay
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Chris
Nobody paid him any mind, no one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap, no one lifted hands
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
50 thousand sold, seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone, three years later
Stepped out the swamp in ten-and-a-half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen, never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect, you'll give me
Ludacris, I live LOUD like Timmay
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache, and it's not a tumor
Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight
Sprayed, so I never let the bedbugs bite
Hard to the core, core to the rotten
Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton
Yahh!
Millze cillzan sillzome plilzay dilzzouble dilzutch!

We so tight that you get our styles tangled
Sway on dosie-do like you loco

Top down, loud sounds, see my peeps
Give them pounds, now look who it be

Look like it's 'bout to rain, what a shame
I got the Armor-All to shine up the stain
Oh, Missy, try to maintain

Begin, I sit on Hills like Lauryn
Until the rain starts coming down, pouring
Chill, I got my umbrella
My finger waves these days, they fall like Humpty
Chumpy, I break up with him before he dump me
To have me, (I can't stand the rain), yes, you lucky (against my window)

You one minute fools, you wonder why y'all missin'
On the back of milk cartons and there's no reward
No regards, close, but it's no cigar
A hard head make a soft ass, but a hard dick make the sex last
I jump in pools and make a big splash
Water overflowin', so get your head right
It's all in your mind, punk, so keep your head tight
Enough with tips and advice and thangs
I'm big dog, havin' women seein' stripes and thangs
They go to sleep, start snorin', countin' sheep and shit
They so wet that they body start to leak and shit
Just 'cause I'm an all-nighter, shoot all fire
Ludacris, balance and rotate all tires
Ooh, I don't want, I don't need, I can't stand no minute man
I don't want no minute man
Ooh, here's your chance, be a man take my hand, understand
I don't want no minute man

Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, break me off, break me off
'Cause I don't want no one minute man

You know lil' mama ain't with that quick shit
You better break me off stiff tongue or stiff dick
One minute, two minutes, three minutes
Hell naw, to please me you gotta sleep in it
I see you talk a good game and you play hard
But if I put this thing on ya, can you stay hard?
If not, you better keep your day job
'Cause I'm looking for a man to make me say God
I'm off glass and you know this
I'll work your ass out like aerobics
So baby stay focused
Start off slow and then speed it up
Baby show me what you got, is you a G or what?
If you can't beat it up then eat it up
Put a cherry on top, whip cream it up, What?
Break me off, show me what you got
'Cause I don't want no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Let's see if you can bring, bring, bring the nasty out of me
N-n-n-now sock it

Ooh ahh, sock it to me like you want to, ooh (oh)

And when you say go I won't move slow (slow)

I'm at your house around midnight (midnight), don't fall asleep

Why Missy be socking it to niggas like Ree-Ree?
The baddest industry bitches of the century
Hit hard like penitentiary dick
Finally admitted that we the shit combination is lethal
Popping Patron with Missy in the 600 with no see-through
Suffer the repercussion fucking with shit like this
We parlay puffing
Constantly making niggas suffer the consequence
Gotta get these ends bitch
House in the Chi with a Caddy, crib in Atlanta with a Benz
Niggas been huffing and puffing but ain't try shit
Got plenty motherfuckers that'll ride quick
Besides, kid wanna bust?
Trigger finger itch when you fucking with me
Jealous because I live more plush
Me and Missy leave a nigga with a head rush
Bring the ruckus, plus...
I'm telling 'em, push and pickin' up profits
For what I'm selling, never gon' stop it
Socking it to niggas and rocking it
Dropping 'em on the spot

Slim Shady
Uh, yo

Well, I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled
Pop the same shit that got 2Pac killed
Spit game to these hoes
Like a soap opera episode
Punch a bitch in the nose 'til her whole face explodes
There's three things I hate:
Girls, women, and bitches (What?)
I'm that vicious to walk up and drop-kick midgets
They call me Boogie Night
The stalker that walks awkward
Stick figured with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Coming through the airport, sluggish, walking on crutches
Hit a fucking  bitch in her  with luggage
It's like a dream I can't snap out
I black out or back out
Lookin for somebody ug' to beat the crap out
I'm bringing you rap singers two middle fingers
I flip you off in French, then translate it to English
Then I'mma vanish off the face of the planet and come back
Speaking so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?
(It's the ill, that cool? Slim Shady)
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?
(It's the ill, that cool? Slim mothafucking Shady)
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?
(It's the ill, that cool? Slim Shady)
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?
(It's the ill, that cool? Slim mothafucking Shady)

I had a huge attitude, started off staticky
Mad at you, had you mad at me automatically (One more time)
I'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity
Who oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following
It's so big, if I counted up all the freaks who follow me (One, two)
I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology (Whoops)
College girls, live in an alcoholic's world
Full of url, head twirls every time the toilet swirls
Covered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up
I won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up (Shut up!)
I made this rap game suspenseful
Cause now I got an impulse game to insult you wit a pencil (Bitch)
They waste the paper on you, chopping down the oakwood
Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good
And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin'
You motherfuckers are puttin' your words together for nothin'
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?
(It's the ill, that cool? Slim Shady)
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?
(It's the ill, that cool? Slim mothafucking Shady)
Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?

Turn the music up, we gon' wake the neighbors (Uh, uh)
We gon' get high, we gon' roll to Vegas (Uh huh, uh)
Me and Slim Shady on some shit daily (Uh, wha-wha?)
What you want, what you got
Is it hot, is it hot?
Turn the music up, we gon' wake the neighbors (Uh, uh)
We gon' get high, we gon' roll to Vegas (Uh huh, uh)
Me and Slim Shady, on some shit daily (Wha-wha? Yo)

"A person from another planet might disagree with you."
"Well, if you want my opinion, he comes from right here on Earth."
Slim Shady, Misdemeanor
Timbaland
Slim Shady, Misdemeanor
I'm homicidal and suicidal with no friends
Holding a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin' tec's at you until you see your fucking legs
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds laying next to you (Ah!)
Fucking mad dog, foaming at the mouth (Grrr)
Fuck mouth, my whole house is foaming at the couch
Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground
(Keep filming!)
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed
Chopped 'em in half, suffocated the oxygen mask
Shit, if I get any higher
I'mma get the East and West beefing again
Fly back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire

Y'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track
Don't shoot Missy! Get back
Uh, I'mma put you all in the line uh, and I'mma watch you MC's die
Yo Mommy, Mommy, Missy done lost her mind
I think somebody done pissed her off this time
Yeah, I'mma have to bus' you through your chest and
Uh, you gon' have to clean up the mess (Uh huh)
It's raining, raining and it's pouring loud
Never fear, 'cause pissy Missy's through the crowd
Uh, I hear that the gats go cha-pow
You shot me dammit! Bitch get down
Don't walk when I talk, I never talk when I smile (Uh huh)
I'mma lay em on down, like they lived underground (Uh)
For the sounds that me and Timbaland, we found
Get your ass kicked later or get your ass kicked now
