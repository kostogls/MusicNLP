No matter what we face
We must face the moment of truth, baby

They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
Nobody's invincible, no plan is foolproof
We all must meet our moment of truth

The same sheisty cats that you hang with and do your thang with Could set you up and wet you up nigga, peep the language
It's universal, you play with fire it may hurt you
Or burn you, lessons are blessings you should learn through
Let's face facts, although MC's lace tracks
It doesn't mean behind the scenes there ain't no dirt to trace back
That goes for all of us, there ain't nobody to trust
It's like sabotage, it's got me ready to bust
But I can't jeopardize what I have done up to this point
So I'ma get more guys to help me run the whole joint
Cultivate, multiply, motivate or else we'll die
You know I be the master of the who, what, where and why
See when you're shinin', some chumps'll wanna dull ya
Always selfish, jealous punks will wanna pull ya
Down, just like some shellfish in a bucket
'Cause they love it to see your ass squirm like a worm
But just as you'll receive what is comin' to you
Everybody else is gonna get theirs too
I ain't no saint, therefore I cannot dispute
That everyone must meet their moment of truth
Actions have reactions, don't be quick to judge
You may not know the hardships people don't speak of
It's best to step back, and observe with couth
For we all must meet our moment of truth

Sometimes you gotta dig deep when problems come near
Don't fear, things get severe for everybody everywhere
Why do bad things happen to good people?
Seems that life is just a constant war between good and evil
The situation that I'm facin' is mad amazin'
To think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
Now I'm contemplatin' in my bedroom pacin'
Dark clouds over my head, my heart's racin'
Suicide? Nah, I'm not a foolish guy
Don't even feel like drinkin' or even gettin' high
'Cause all that's gonna do really is accelerate
The anxieties that I wish I could alleviate
But wait, I've been through a whole lot of other shit before
So I oughta be able to withstand some more
But I'm sweatin' though, my eyes are turnin' red and yo
I'm ready to lose my mind, but instead I use my mind
I put down the knife and take the bullets out my 9
My only crime was that I'm too damn kind
And now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take what's mine
But they can't take the respect that I've earned in my lifetime
And you know they'll never stop the furious force of my rhymes
So like they say, every dog has its day
And like they say, God works in a mysterious way
So I pray, rememberin' the days of my youth
As I prepare to meet my moment of truth
You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free!

Yo, I got one lyric pointed at your head for start
Another one is pointed at your weak-ass heart
Now if I pull the trigger on these fully-loaded lines
You're gonna wish I would've pulled a black 9
I mack dimes, crack the spines of the fake gangsters
Yeah the bitin' triflin' niggas and the studio pranksters
Yo, lookin' at the situation plainly: will you remain, G?
Or will you be looked upon strangely?
I reign as the articulator with the greater data
Revolvin' on the TASCAM much doper than my last jam
While others struggle to juggle tricky metaphors
I explore more to expose the core
A lot of emcees act stupid to me
And we have yet to see if they can match our longevity
But anyway, it's just another day
Another fake jack I slay with my spectac' rap display
Style's smooth but rugged, you can't push or shove it
You dig it and you dug it 'cause like money you love it
The king of monotone, with my own throne
Righteously violent prone, my words bring winds like cyclones
Stormin' your hideout, blockin' out your sunlight
Your image and your business were truly not done right
Throw up your He Allah Now Divine Saviours
You got no hand skills, there's no security to save ya
No pager, no celly, no drop top Benz-y
I came to bring your phony hip-hop to an ending
My art of war will leave you sore from the abuse
'Cause you must meet your moment of truth
They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
No one is untouchable, no man is bulletproof
We all must meet our moment of truth75EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"It has come to our attention
That a mysterious force is loose somewhere in outer space"
"The mysteries of creation are there"
"Up in the sky?" "Up in the sky"
"The moon and the planets are there
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there
And therefore, as we set sail, we ask God's blessing
On the most hazardous and dangerous
And greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked"
"Prepared for lift off"

I Self Lord and Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
With a force that can't be compared
To any firepower, for it's mind power shared
The brainwave causes vessels to circulate
Like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the Father and Mother Earth
Seekin' everlastin' life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look, listen and observe
And watch another C-Cipher pullin' my peeps to the curb
Heed the words, it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turnin' a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher
Thoughts will spray like street sweepers
Little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck, plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combined, over the front line
The ten-percenters promotin' slander in the airtime
Bear in mind, jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp blades, heavenly praise and dues are paid
Above the crowds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual
Above the clouds, rainin' down, holdin' it down

Yeah, I leave scientists mentally scarred, triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
And catch a charge, shake 'em down like the riot squad
Invade your zone, ruin like Ancient Rome
I span the universe and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Colossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts on my life, so who to trust?
Who but us to supply ya with the fire?
The burnin' truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and mourn
But our hands are on the ammo 'cause the battle still on
Sound the horn, we come rumblin' through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin'
When we die hard, they'll build a monument to honor us with
Humongous effect in the world, we could've conquered it
Above the crowds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual
Above the clouds, rainin' down, holdin' it down54EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Like a freshly cut diamond
Like a freshly cut diamond

Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like "C.R.E.A.M." or "My Melody"
Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought
Like respect in the hood that can't be bought
Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like "C.R.E.A.M." or "My Melody"
Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought
Like respect in the hood that can't be bought
Word up, diamonds
Like a freshly cut diamond

Diamonds are forever like friends that'll kill for you
Went up in a jewelry store, burglary, steal for you
Build with you, split the diamond into ice blue
Thrice he tried to disrespect our kinship, I don't like you
And now you axed out the fam'
But I'm cashin' checks with Premier on this jam
Robin Leach, interviews on the beach
When we shake hands, nothin' but ice on the reach, and I teach
Like the Rap Reverend Ike without the perm', I preach
There's more you need to learn, I return for my streets
Gainin' my wealth, trainin' myself
For corny confrontation with haters who be playin' themselves
Diamonds are like my world of rap
Your rhymin', huh, it's like a world of crap
And a diamond is like a fly-ass girl that's strapped
And you can't beat that with a bat
Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like "C.R.E.A.M." or "My Melody"
Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought
Like respect in the hood that can't be bought
Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like "C.R.E.A.M." or "My Melody"
Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought (Yeah)
Like respect in the hood that can't be bought
Word up, diamonds

Diamonds (Diamonds), diamonds (Diamonds), yeah
Pick up the pen, write down the sins, cleanse
Lay that shit down, play it for friends
Make a few M's, then do it again
J. Cole, who'd have thought you woulda been rhymin' with ghosts
Guru flows forever like a diamond
The most could never afford the precious jewels
That's precisely why I'm blessin' you with clear-cut messages
I'm destined to invest in urban sections where depression rules
I hope to heal the destitute before I leave this vestibule
Between the heavens and the seven circles
Where some dead homies maybe rest, I plan to resurrect a few
I press the truth against the neck of devils
Look at the youth just like a precious pebble
Meant to be protected, mentally we let this
Poison of Western philosophy make us sloppy
We forgot we are the chosen
From hip-hop to astronomy, they copy what we showed 'em
Niggas be talkin' slick, but only try me over modems
In person they starstruck, they hearts flutter
I'm like the realest one you ever met
If you don't feel this one, give it a sec
Go live a little, let the years pass
Experience pain, watch the tears crash on to the floor
Hurt brings wisdom
Wisdom brings a whole 'nother sort of understandin'
Diamonds only worth what we demandin', uh, uh
And niggas payin' top-dollar
Once upon a time I paid a 100 for mine, now I'm a lot smarter
Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like "C.R.E.A.M." or "My Melody"
Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought
Like respect in the hood that can't be bought
Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like "C.R.E.A.M." or "My Melody"
Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought
Like respect in the hood that can't be bought

I rock diamonds that cut glass out of window panes
Baldhead Slick blazing tracks when the indo's flame
Rocks that bling, rocks that make them jock my team
Rocks that shine, rocks that keep my hand on my nine
Rocks that blind, make the High Rocks drop down
One of a kind, niggas best jet from the spot when I cock mine
Diamonds are like your man you always call fam
Diamonds are like your grandma you always call ma'am
Diamonds are like having the whole world in your hand
Diamonds are like the shows I ripped with no band
Rockin' your knot, stoppin' your plot
It's me, Baldhead Slick Duke, coppin' your block
For you it's only pain, for me it's only gain
Diamonds are like loyalty, iced out like royalty
Diamonds are like my wifey, so sweet the way she spoils me
(So good)
Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like "C.R.E.A.M." or "My Melody"
Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought
Like respect in the hood that can't be bought
Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like "C.R.E.A.M." or "My Melody"

Every single mic he touches
I've suffered, just so I could return harder
Wanna be the shit starter, fuck around, make you a martyr
I make you famous, turn around, then make you nameless
‘Cause you never understood how vital to me this rap game is
Save it and hold that, you catch a hot one
Rhymes chase a fake nigga down soon as I spot one

So if you stand in my way, I'ma have to spray
Learn that if you come against me, son, you're gonna have to pray
Since back in the day I held the weight and kept my head up
They wanna see the god catch an L, it's all a set-up
I give no man or thing power over me
Why these niggas so jealous and looking sour over me?
I'm bolder, G, I'm like impossible to stop
I'm like that nigga in the ring with you impossible to drop
I'm like two magazines fully-loaded to your one
Plus, I ain't gonna quit spittin' 'til you're done

More than a decade of hits that'll live forever

Blowing back your wig piece
Just for the way you're looking at me
Cock back, blaow, I hit you up right now
I don't know why so many of y'all wanna be thugs anyhow
Face the consequence of your childish nonsense
I could make your head explode just by my lyrical content
Get you in my scope and metaphorically snipe ya
I never liked ya, I gas that ass and then ignite ya
The flamethrower, make your peeps afraid to know ya
How many times I told ya? Play your position, small soldier!
My heart is colder, makes me wanna resort to violence
Stop beating me in the head, son, nah, I'm not buyin' it
I'm ready to blast, ready to surpass and harass
I'm ready to flip, yeah, I'm ready to dip with all the cash
I hold my chrome steady with a tight grip
So watch your dome already, 'cause this one might hit
Full clip, do you wanna mess with this?
Gang Starr, I'm one of the best yet
I'm nice like that
It's all good in this business of rap
Full clip, do you wanna mess with this?

"Are you working? What kind of work do you do?"
- Uh -
"Boy - boy - boy -
What is it you wanna do when you grow up?"

Aiyo, I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah surprisingly
I've been laying, waiting for your next mistake
I put in work and watch my status escalate

Now, I'm gon' start collecting props, connecting plots
Networking like a conference ‘cause the nonsense is yet to stop
Jakes shake me down, haters wanna take me down
Break me down, CLAP! – all they heard was a sound
Yo, I scoped it out, I took your weak dream and choked it out
Your bitch don't really got no ass, she just poked it out
On the D-low, I'm saying you versus me though?
We can do this shit right here in front of your people
See, time is money, kid and BS walks
And to me it's funny, kid when you meatheads talk
I see feds stalk, they wanna dig up the dirt, son
Is it me they hawk? ‘Cause I be putting in work, son
Aiyo, I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah surprisingly
I've been laying, waiting for your next mistake
I put in work and watch my status escalate

You cornballs get stonewalled, blackballed, I own y'all
The veteran, running my plan, I'm the better man
Crazy raw, doing my job like the mob
Blazing y'all and disappearing in the fog
Or a mist and chicks can't resist what I kick
They be begging for attention or some more of the dillznick
Word up, baby, someone may have to get hurt up, baby
Shit is mad shady, but I got to get the gravy
Platinum respect like the force of a TEC
Keep you hitting the deck, feeling heat in your chest
Banging your thoughts with the hot onslaught
A kid got shot on the spot for going where he should not
Viciously, I make history instantly
Those other lame-ass loser-ass niggas, they can't fuck with me
I'm doing my thing now to lamp later on
Paid in the shade with some fly gators on
But now I'm grimy as they get, mud on my pants and shirt
I bet you niggas out here know, I be putting in work
Aiyo, I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah surprisingly
I've been laying, waiting for your next mistake
I put in work and watch my status escalate

Greg N-I-C-E

Aww yeah, it’s another Gang Starr sure shot, uh!
Featurin' the one and only, handl’it handl’it, Roy, Nice & Smooth
Hey, Gang Starr has gots to be the sure shot
Nice & Smooth has gots to be the sure shot
Gang Starr has gots to be the sure shot
Nice & Smooth has gots to be the sure shot

Greg Nice! Greg N-I-C-E
Dame un beso, ah oui oui
Rock for a fee, not for free
Maybe I'll do it for charity
Now, my employer or my employee
Is makin' Greg N-I-C-E very M-A-D
Don't ever ever think of jerkin' me
I work too hard for my royalty
Put lead in your ass and drink a cup of tea
Peace to Red Alert and Kid Capri
Ooohh la la, ah oui oui
I say Muhammad Ali, you say Classius Clay
I say butter, you say Parkay
It's alright, if you wanna make a sway
I'm away Uptown, took the deuce to the tre
I originate, they duplicate
I praise the Lord and keep the faith
It's alright, keep bitin' at the bait
'92, uh! One year later
Peace out, Premier, take me out with the fader
Oka-yay, o-o-oka-ay, o-o-o-oka-ay, h-here it-here it is

I chant 'eeny, meeny, miny, moe'
I wreck the mic like a pimp pimps hoes
Here's how it goes: I am a genius, I mean this
I shape this, you'll tape this, I'm kinda fiendish
You wish that you could come into my neighborhood
Meanin' my mental state, still I'm 5-foot-8
Crazy as I wanna be, ‘cause I make it orderly
You could say I'm sorta the boss, so get lost
The brother who will make you change opinions
Dominions, I'm in 'em when it's time to kick shit from the heart
Plus, I get a piece of the action
Feelin' satisfaction from the street crowd reaction
Chumps pull guns when they feel afraid
Too late, when they dip in the kick, they get sprayed
Lemonade was a popular drink and it still is
I get more props and stunts than Bruce Willis
A poet like Langston Hughes
And can't lose when I cruise out on the expressway
Leavin' the bodega, I say "Suavé"
Premier's got more beats than barns got hay
Clips are inserted into my gun
So I can take the money, never have to run
Yo, Keithy E, I left my Phillie at home, do you have another?
I wanna get blunted, my brother
Now, may I make a mark then make a spark
Over this phat track – or should I say dope beat?
Subtract, delete
All of the wick wack that wanna be abstract
But they lack the new knack that's comin' from way, way back
Hey, yo, Premier, please pass that buddha sack
You heard we quit? No way, bullshit!
I told you before we come back with more hits
I provide bright flavor, so you can sketch me
Do me a favor, don't try to catch me
Slightly ahead of the game, I'm not a lame
Ask him, he'll tell you the same he knows my name
Smooth, I drop jewels like paraphernalia
I'm infallible, not into failure
Like a rhinoceros, my speed is prosperous
And pure knowledge expands from my esophagus
I write in the night to bring truth to the light
My dialogue is my own, ‘cause Smooth B will never bite

After the tour quits, I come back with more hits
After the tour quits, I come back with more hits
After the tour quits, I come back with more hits11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal"

"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal"

No way, you'll never make it
Come with the weak shit, I'll break it
Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya
Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass
A lot of rappers be like one-time wonders
Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under their noses
I hate those motherfuckin' posers
But I'm so real to them it's scary
And with my unique skills, nah, you can't compare me
And no, we don't make wack tracks
And all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin' real facts
I represent, set up shit like a tent, boy
You're paranoid 'cause you're a son like Elroy
And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal

"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal"
"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal"
Oh yes, I'm greater than all MC's when I breeze
Give me room, please
I be like fascinatin' when I be updatin'
Cuttin' off wack kids, pullin' their trump cards
I thump hard, and make 'em say that I'm God
Niggas be pretendin' they're hardcore
Never know the meanin' of (raw)
But I get props like a slogan
And no man could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam
Lyrically def and connectin', complete mic-wreckin'
No double-checkin', vocals kill like weapons
But if I have to, I go all out with no mic
Yeah, that's right, 'cause I survived mad fights
And for my peeps I truly care
'Cause without some of them I wouldn't be here
And they all know how I feel
'Cause suckers be like playin' themselves to have mass appeal

"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal"
"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal"
"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal"
"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal"

I know I'm dope, but don't wet that
I've suffered setbacks, but now I'm makin' greenbacks
Just like baggy slacks, I'm crazy hip-hop
Check one two and you don't stop
Your head'll bop when I drop my crop of pure bomb
Just like the seashore, I'm calm but wild
With my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Gimme a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond, I go on and on
For you it's tragic, I got magic like wands
So I'ma end this lecture and I bet ya
Those who kick dirt, in due time I'm gonna get ya
'Cause I be kickin' the real
While they be losin' the race tryin' to chase mass appeal
"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal"
"Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal"

That makes me know that what we're doing
We had the right idea in the beginning
And and we just need to maintain our focus and elevate
We what we do we update our formulas
We have certain formulas but we update em (oh right)
With the times and everything y'know
So y'know the rhyme style is elevated
The style of beats is elevated but it's still Guru and Premier
And it's always a message involved

The real (The real)
Hip-hop (Hip-hop)
MCing (MCing), and DJing (DJing)
From your own mind (From your own mind)
You know? (You know?)
I, I guess right now we should start the show

Who's the suspicious character
Strapped with the sounds profound?
Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
You're in the Terrordome, like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads
‘Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
‘Cause I'm like the Wizard, and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hittin' like some double Desert Eagles
Sportin' caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtractin' all the rappers who lack over Premier's tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whoop ass
Droppin' lyrics that be hotter than sex and candle wax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that
While the world's revolvin', on its axis
I come with mad lovin', plus the illest warlike tactics
The wilderness is filled with this
So many people searchin' for false bliss
I'm here with the skills you've missed
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Sorta like the master builder when I make my way home
You know my steez
You know my steez
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live, keep it live)
To the beat y'all

The beat is sinister, Premo makes you relax
I'm like the minister, when I be lacin' the wax
I be bringin' salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feelin' more power
Stealin' at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines take flight
The apparatus gets blessed, and suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure, I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreadin' like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid
But still can't make the fuckin' grade
How many times are wannabe's gonna lie?
Yo, they must wanna fry
They can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness, carryin' my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holdin' down the fort
You know my steez
(You know my steez)
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
The mic

On the microphone, you know that I'm one of the best yet
Some punks ain't paid all of their debts yet
Tryin' to be fly, ridin' high on the jet
Set with juvenile rhymes, makin' fake-ass death threats
Big deal, like En Vogue, here's somethin' you can feel
Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out, you be like, "Damn, he flipped!"
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, givin' you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip, it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick, why is the press all on my di-dick?
My style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot
Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a friggin' riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas
Yo, them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speakin' from my parables and carry you beyond
The mic's either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm, no pulse, you're gone
And if you thought we'd lose our niche
In this rap shit, you way wrong
I stay up, I stay on, shine bright like neon
Your song's pathetic, synthetic like Rayon
Fat beats, they play on
Want dope rhymes? Put me on
Word is bond

Yo what up son?
-Yo what up kid?
Yo, you holdin your head up?
-I'm tryin to man, but the system is shady
Word man they always man, they always tryin
To keep a good brother down, but I'm sayin
We still, you know we got love for you son
And we prayin for you and we, you know
We tryin to hold it down wh
You know while you in there man
-No question
Hopefully they won't keep you in there for too long

-Yeah man
Yo that's my nigga, yaknowwhaImean
-Scarface is tight son
Yo that's a good idea word is bond
I'm gonna talk the play in tomorrow(yeah) and
See about if we could hook up wit him
-That's proper
Scandalous, money greed and lust
In this trife life, there ain't nobody you can trust
Plus there's no justice, it's just us
In fact, watchin' yo back it be must
And each and everyday around the way gats bust
And jealous so-called friends'll try to set you up
It's called betrayal

Check the horror scene
The kid was like twelve or thirteen
Never had the chance like other kids to follow dreams
Watched his father catch two in the dome and to the spleen
Nothin' but blood everywhere, these streets are mean
They spared his life, but killed his moms and his sister Jean
Of course over some drug shit
His pops was on some ill-out, spill your guts, on some thug shit
Didn't know his boys was on some shady ass no love shit
His pops got played out though, with silencers they laid him out yo
Took his stash and all the cash and left 'em, tied up on the couch yo
With tape over his mouth, so he couldn't cry out
Cause his dad was the nigga with clout
Survival of the fittest so they split his wig no doubt
Despite the stocking caps he noticed the same cat, who used to give him dough
And taught him, to use the same gat
Supposed to be an Uncle, fam and all that
He could tell that it was him cause he had on the same slacks, he wore when
He took him to Meadowlands racetrack
Why did he flip and go out like that?
It's called betrayal
Scandalous, money greed and lust
In this trife life, there ain't nobody you can trust
Plus there's no justice, it's just us
In fact, watchin' yo back it be must
And each and everyday around the way gats bust
And jealous so-called friends'll try to set you up
It's called betrayal

A betrayal
Punk ass niggas
It's called betrayal
He on a mission to become a ball player
Flip big Benz's, flossin' all gators
Had it all mapped out, a 6-8 12th grader
Fresh outta school and finna go make paper
He had a brother who was hustlin', collectin' his change
Never let his baby brother stick his neck in the game
Told him all he had to do is just enjoy the ride
And he ain't have to worry about money cause that's in time
So now he's pacin' as the time moves slowly
Can't wait to face Shaquille in the paint and school Kobe
Kept his grades and stayed up under neighborhood functions
And then a group of knuckleheads came through dumping
So now he's sittin' on the sidewalk bleeding
Fell into a puddle of his own blood and stopped breathin'
And everybody in the neighborhood still grievin'
But destiny caught up with his ass and he got even
And all the cryin' in the world ain't goin' to bring him back
His brother, sittin' at the wake wipin' tears from his mother's eyes
Why'd the game have to go and take the young boys life
Only the wicked live shife, payin' the price
While he's starin' at the shell his brother's soul once held
The trigger man made bail
And you, wouldn't pay the boy his mail, and sacrificed your fuckin' family
That's betrayal
Betrayal (echoes)
Scandalous, money greed and lust
In this trife life, there ain't nobody you can trust
Plus there's no justice, it's just us
In fact, watchin' yo back it be must
And each and everyday around the way gats bust
And jealous so-called friends'll try to set you up

Yo
Yo Premier?
Yeah whassup G?
That trip to L.A., may be delayed
Why whassup I'm on my way to the airport now
Yeah well your boy Guru got knocked
WHAT?!
I don't know what this is about, sounds crazy man
Something about a gun
"The court calls Keith Elam to the stand
Please approach the bench."

Yo they got me handcuffed, I'm down in central booking
Things are fucked up, the way my future's looking
But I'm too fly, I'mma change this scenario
Make some power moves and tighten up my bankroll
Chumps are leary though, they see me as a threat
I'm like the black Dutch Schultz when you get me upset
5-0 makes me wanna flip, Larry Davis style
Got a nigga depressed, while he's awaiting trial
It's OK though, cause from grey skies come blue
Through darkness comes light and I be known as the Guru
And this I certify we all should be alerted by
The traps within the system our youth is getting murdered by
The D.A. says they got me on a felony
I'm trying to live my life, so what the fuck is you telling me?
The streets are war, that's what brothers carry weapons for
And I take the weight as I did before
The next thing you know, they got me on the radio
A rapper arrested, suckers showing me on video
Of course I know that I'm a role model
But yo, this rap life is real life: sometimes it's full throttle
Right now I gotta think about me; fuck the industry
You gets no love except those who support me
What's the story? What happened when I went to L.A.?
Mixing shit up, no not there I got family
Nothing happened, mind your business, yo, step
You know we connect - JFK to LAX
They wanna lock us all up, and throw away the key
Don't wanna see us come up, don't wanna see us making G's
Long as we know this is the key to our destruction
Let's make moves, no discussion

Peace to my man Hass, an Orange Man paying the cost
All the twenty-five-to-lifers, all my brothers getting tossed
Into the system, supposed to rehabilitate
It's why you gotta regulate your own mindstate
Read, study lessons and build your inner power
The next level, doesn't tolerate cowards
For example, I know this rich Nigerian
Powerful American that's proud to be an African
He asked me why do all us brothers be getting trapped
I told him I'd explain it, broke it down in a rap
Whether you got naps, braids waves or no hair
Without esteem for yourself, nigga, you going nowhere
And you can swagger like you rude as Josey Wales
Unorganized revolt almost always mostly fails
Give up the savage ways, be effective soldiers
To elevate the mental is to be poor no more
There's war in the streets, prepared men know best
I rhyme as live as it gets, JFK to LAX
They're always making trouble yo, against the righteous
Killing us in cold blood, those beasts, those vipers
And as I sit feeling the pain in my wrist
I vow to myself that I'ma change this shit
Or at least I gotta try or part of me will die
And only by action will any ideas solidify
So I inhale, exhale as I ponder
This grown man will make mistakes no longer
I've been there, I've seen how they make us fall victim
To their tricknowledgy, with no apology I diss em
And so I rip facts, to dope tracks I caress
You're gonna hear about it, from JFK to LAX9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"Gang Starr has gots to be the sure shot"
"And it's like that" (Primo scratching)
"Gang Starr has gots to be the sure shot"
"And it's like dat" (Primo scratching)
"Gang Starr has gots to be the sure shot"
"And it's like that" (Primo scratching)
"Gang Starr" "Represent"

One of the meanest and the cleanest
And still I'm kind of fiendish when I'm at this
Been doin' this for eons, peons best to catch this
Vision of excellence precise rappin' ability
'Bout to make some dead presidents, mackin' a million, G
The money though, it's got people acting funny yo
As soon as some niggas get some light, they be like dummies yo
Products and puppets and pawns, gettin' played out
When authentic niggas step up, respect be layed out
Major effect to your sector, I'm the corrector
Live and direct, wavin' my mic like a sceptor
Supreme exalted, universal leader
Descendent of the kings and queens, the overseer
The overlord, cream of the crop, crème de la crème
Spent years building with cats in the streets so they my men
Again, Gang Starr has done it
Remember too much jewels back in the days? You'd have to run it
Check it, the ground be hot under our feet
So we be listenin' to beats to keep the cypher complete
Whether you kids be holdin' on the block all day
Or you be puffin' lye out in the back hallway
Or whether you be in school or in the library
Wherever you are, baby paw, realize that your essence
Is divine, son, and let it shine, son, as we refine, son
Ayo, this shit'll blow your mind, son, we're royalty
Wherever I go, I want to take nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I have to stand out from all the rest
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I want to take nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I just wanna stand out from all the rest

And all the girls they want to spoil me
My honey anoints me with oils, G
After work she greets me and treats me like royalty
Works with me, givin' herself by my side
She don't sweat me for loot, my fame or my ride
A lot of ladies out there be lookin' lovely
But they don't got no control of their life, inside they're ugly
Word to Bugsy, and to Red Alert
Sway and Tech, and Funkmaster Flex to make your head jerk
Chicks go beserk when they see us in the spot
K-Ci, JoJo and Primo, creepin' to the top
And to the sweethearts out there breakin' hearts
While we're takin' part of this hip-hop art
Listen yo, the best way, it ain't always the fast way
And yes, the best way, it ain't always to act nasty
I'll open up the door always before you pass me
Baby Doll, because you're royalty
Wherever I go, I want to take nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I have to stand out from all the rest
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I want to take nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I just wanna stand out from all the rest

"Gang Starr has to gots to be the sure shot"

To whom it may concern
This goes out to anybody who’s doing the bullshit, straight up
Yo, everybody’s calling me, my lawyer, everybody on this, ‘yo did you scratch such n such name?
Or this, that, and the third on the record for a hook?’
Y’all keep calling me on that shit and y’all supposed to be hip hoppers and all that, and letting the industry control the rules of the hip hop world that we made?
Y’all need to knock that shit off, that’s some greedy-ass, fake bullshit!
Knock that shit off for real!
Y'know'm sayin'?
And when that shit come and slap you in the face, that greed, I’ma be right there laughing at y’all…
And one other thing… What’s the deal with you break-record cats putting out all the original records that we sample from and snitching by puttin us on the back of it sayin we used stuff?
You *know* how that go!
Stop doing that, y’all are violatin', straight up and down!
Word up, man, I’m sick of this shit
Y’all muthafuckas really don’t know what this hip hop is all about
So while you keep on faking the funk, we gonna keep on walkin' through the darkness, carryin' our torches
Underground will live forever, baby
We just like roaches, never dyin', always livin'…
And on that note, let's get back to the program…8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Guru: Peace Brother Elijah
Elijah Shabazz: Hey peace Guru, how you doing?
Guru: I'm maintaining, just been thinking though man
About the situation for today's youth man, the seeds man
What's your opinion on that?
Elijah Shabazz: Mmm that's strange I was thinkin the same thing
Something I read in the holy Qur'an how it says
"Has thou seen him who belies religion?
That is one who is rough, to the orphan."
And no matter what we say our religion is
Whether it's Islam, Christianity, Juddaism, Buddha-ism, Old School-ism or New School-ism
If we're not schooling the youth WITH wisdom
Then the sins of the father will visit the children
And that's not keepin it real...
That's keeping it - *WRONG*

Now that we're getting somewhere, you know we got to give back
For the youth is the future no doubt that's right and exact
Squeeze the juice out, of all the suckers with power
And pour some back out, so as to water the flowers
This world is ours, that's why the demons are leery
It's our inheritance; this is my Robin Hood Theory... Robin Hood Theory

I seek Sun, deceive none, for each one must teach one
At least one must flow and show the structure, of freedom
It's me Dunn, cause petty things we don't need 'em
Let's focus to create somethin great, for all that sees them
They innocent, they know not what they face
While politicians save face genius minds lay to waste
If I wasn't kickin rhymes I'd be kickin down doors
Creatin social change and defendin the poor
The God's always been militant, and ready for war
We're gonna snatch up the ringleaders send em home in they drawers
But first where's the safe at? Let's make em show us
And tell em hurry up, give up the loot that they owe us
We bringin it back, around the way to our peeps
Cause times are way too deep, we know the Code of the Streets
Meet your defeat; this is my Robin Hood Theory... my Robin Hood Theory
I floss my rhymes like dentals, my mental's presidential
From the wild ghetto districts to the plush residential
Essential, would be the message that I send you
I meant to, elevate at every venue
Pops told me to pursue what is true, and nothing other
And nowadays I pave the way for troops of my young brothers
Necessary by all means, sort of like Malcolm
Before it's too late; I create, the best outcome
So I take this opportunity, yes to ruin the
Devilish forces fucking up my black community
And we ain't doing no more interviews
Til we get paid out the frame, like motherfucking Donahue
We're taking over radio, and wack media
Cause systematically they getting greedier and greedier
Conquering turfs with my ill organization
Takin out the man while we scan the information
You wanna rhyme you best await son
You can't even come near, if you ain't got our share
You front on us this year, consider yourself blown out of here
Yeah... by my Robin Hood Theory

Squeeze the juice out, of all the suckers with power
And pour some back out, so as to water the flowers
This world is ours, that's why the demons are leery
It's our inheritance; this is my Robin Hood Theory
God is Universal, he is the Ruler Universal
For those who can't follow that spells GURU when in my circle
I see all sides of my culture...
Design my thoughts like a sculpture
And chumps they wanna get with me cause I'm another entity
I'm sent to be, leadin the army of the century
Mention me, and snakes will retreat, eventually...
... due to my Robin Hood Theory

Now that we're getting somewhere, you know we got to give back
For the youth is the future no doubt that's right and exact
Squeeze the juice out, of all the suckers with power
And pour some back out, so as to water the flowers
This world is ours, that's why the demons are leery
It's our inheritance; this is my Robin Hood Theory8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"Here's a bulletin from state police, Princeton Junction."
"The militia...
Certain individuals of unidentified nature
Is now under complete control"
"Hip-hop is not, what it is today.."
"It's the real *echoes*... it's the (militia)"

If heads only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd relocate, and change their fuckin' name
I eradicate move fakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with life takers, have sex with rump shakers
I make moves so I'mma earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin' and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's all right, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at night
'Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
With the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam I blast my way out
There'll be no lettin' up, just straight shuttin' up
Or we'll start the wettin' up
Lyrical infrared sceptor never miss you
Big Shug, Guru, Freddie Foxxx, The Militia, militia
Everybody's spittin' it, the rhyme is hot
'Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop
It's The Militia
Everybody's spittin' it, the rhyme is hot
'Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop
It's The Militia

Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, 'til everybody knows
That I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
Til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
For big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin', my name and face you're rememberin'
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin'
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
That I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded Glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin'
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia
Everybody's spittin' it, the rhyme is hot
'Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop
It's The Militia

You niggas owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggas in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is butter baby, spread it around
But when you niggas don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit a "buck" in the face
Of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggas and how I bust up their nose
And while your, nose is drippin', and drainin' blood
I'll be standing over you screamin', "Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!"
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in their palm
'Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin Glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect *gun clicks* you get the tech
I turn you fake niggas on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggas, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You step inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggas who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay one up, what's up?
I got stripes like you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggas do best - bite
Y'all niggas can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Preem' brought Bumpy this track so I'ma let you know
Before I slide I'mma leave you this jewel
Even mechanics walk around with they tools
It's the Militia3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Take this for example young brothers want rep
Cause in the life they're living, you can't half step
It starts with the young ones doing crime for fun
And if you ain't down, you'll get played out son
So let's get a car, you know, a fly whip
Get a dent puller, screwdriver and be off quick
With a dope ride, yeah, and a rowdy crew
We can bag us a Benz and an Audi, too
Even a jeep or a van, goddamn, we're getting ours, yo
Take a trip up the strip, and be like stars so
It doesn't matter if the cops be scoping
They can't do jack, that's why a young brother's hopin'
To do anything, anywhere, anyplace
Buckwild in another court case
It's the code of the streets

They might say we're a menace to society
But at the same time I say "Why is it me?"
Am I the target, for destruction?
What about the system, and total corruption?
I can't work at no fast-food joint
I got some talent, so don't you get my point?
I'll organize some brothers and get some crazy loot
Selling D-R-U-G-S and clocking dollars, troop
Cause the phat dough, yo, that suits me fine
I gotta have it so I can leave behind
The mad poverty, never having always needing
If a sucker steps up, then I leave him bleeding
I gotta get mine, I can't take no shorts
And while I'm selling, here's a flash report
Organized crime, they get theirs on the down low
Here's the ticket, wanna bet on a horse show?
You gotta be a pro, do what you know
When you're dealing with the code of the streets
Nine times out of ten I win, with the skills I be wielding
Got the tenth one kneeling, let me express my feelings
Guru has never been one to play a big shot
It's just the styles I got that keep my mic hot
And fuck turning my back to the street scene
It gives me energy, so I'mma keep fiends
Coming, just to get what I'm selling
Maybe criminal or felon dropping gems on your melon
So keep abreast to the Gang Starr conquest
Underground ruffnecks, pounds of respect
I've never been afraid to let loose my speech
My brothers know I kick the code of the streets11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yo, I don't even want to fight with you, man
I'll lay you right where you stand
You can catch a few shells
One go right through your Polo, man
Usually I'm dolo, and I got a crazy team
Call 'Kiss to ride on you, watch for the laser beam
Shit, it's that O.G. Flavor
Remind you of a corner bodega and that Olde E behavior
On play, but I ain't trying to scuffle with chumps
My long joints got the culture power plus the double pump
Troublesome to anyone who stands in the way
I'll stand and I'll spray, fuck if your man's in the way
Your girl want me ‘cause I do it better than you
The whole world wants me, nigga, I'm a legend to you
Like LL, Rakim, Ice-T and them niggas
Like Cube, Snoop and Dre, I'ma be seeing them figures
It don't matter, you don't have to be liking me, man
Keep playing, you'll be laying there, right where you stand

Gun on my waist, knife in my hand
I keep telling you cowards
I'ma leave you there, right where you stand
I don't want to talk and I ain't trying to fight with your man
Trying to get it over quick, leave you right where you stand
Some say I'm trifling; sometimes I rightfully am
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma leave you right where you stand
You just mad, you will never be as nice as I am
D-Block, Gang Starr, leave you right where you stand, what
You wanna know why I invest
All my money into haze and into dope?
‘Cause right now, I'm currently a slave for Interscope
Respect first, then money – basic shit
If you got niggas under pressure, you could take they shit
Listen, I'ma leave you right where you stand
Have the ambulance
Pass your Timberlands off right to your man
‘Cause he pussy, he ain't gonna do nothin' but look
When it come to beef, he don't want do nothin' but cook
As soon as the chrome scope him
Right there, two in the dome, smokin'
'Kiss keeps funeral homes open
I fall back, smoke an ounce in the dark
Bounce on a Preme track like I bounce on a NARC
Keep playing, y'all niggas will burn
And you know they say it takes something to happen for niggas to learn
Let the .40 Cal give 'em a perm
This industry is like bacteria, and my flow is a germ
Just mad ‘cause you'll never be as nice as I am
J to the "mwah" and I'll leave you right where you stand

I see you got the fear of God in you
We'll tear your heart in two
Too bad you didn't know what you got into
Yeah, the most righteous, to Malcolm got a close likeness
My name carry weight, decapitate most vipers
Hot rhyme-spitter, dime-hitter, case-beater
Flow is angry like I'm in your face with heaters
Chasin' beavers? Nah, I don't ever have to do that
P.I. till I die, and then I laugh at you cats
You happy perhaps ‘cause you got dough and bitches
But no love in the streets, only from 'mos and snitches
Only from the meat-lappin', suckers won't see it happen
Cross that line, then it's time for the heat-clappin'
I do my thing like the whole planet depends on me
I got game to make Janet wanna spend on me
Some say I'm triflin', and sometimes I rightfully am
Get your man: I'll lay him right where he stand

(Skills) Now you feel it when we drop those
Hot beats, stop foes, killing shit, we got those
(Skills) It's the music that the street loves
Each thug is now reppin' this with deep love
(Skills) Gang Starr dueling again
Ruling again, watch as we do it again

Brothers are amused by other brothers' reps
Some niggas pull TECs, catch others for checks
All for respect, all for the bread
For the chance of success they might hand him his head
Remain humble cause I know enough
Plus the road is tough, especially when you roll with us
But I'ma stay with my peeps, stay in these streets
Rhyme spraying and I'm playing for keeps, cause I got those...

Mmm
You gotta hold your head up..
Oahh-eahh-oh-ahh, oahh-eahh-oh-ahh
Oahh-eahh ahh-ahh
Oahh-eahh-oh-ahh-oh-ahh-oh-ahh-ahhhh
Oahh-eahh-oh-ahh, oahh-eahh-oh-ahh
Oahh-eahh-oh-ahh

Yo.. just because I want to it don't mean I will
And just because I'm angry it don't mean I'd kill
And just because she looks good it don't mean I'd hit it
And just because I'm horny, it don't mean I'm widdit
Just because I make records, don't mean that I'm gassed
And just because I'm rappin, don't mean I chase ass
Just because I'm whylin don't mean I can't stop
I got discipline baby, and I use it a lot
People, here's somethin that you should be considerin
Things could turn bitter when, you don't use discipline
You might wake up the next day, upset and in fear
Buggin out, yappin bout, "How the fuck did I get here?
Who the hell is this stranger, starin all in my face?"
Now you wishin you hadn't positioned yourself, in that place
Think just in case you shoulda took more precaution
A good time can become a nightmare so often
Like this nigga I know, that met these chicks on tour
They rocked him to sleep, robbed his ass for cash galore
Skated off in the night, without a trace or a hint
Scheamin tantalizin him, dressed up in lace and shit
Caught that kid out there, all high and dumbfounded
Made him think he was gettin some pussy
He just knew he was gonna pound it
Situations like this, will make you think twice
That's why instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life
Baby won't you take the time (take the time)
Let me know what's on your mind (your mind)
Just because I'm yours don't make it right
(don't make it right)
Baby won't you take the time (bay-bee..)
Let me know what's on your mind (I'm waiting..)
Slow down baby now let's make it right (on your love..)
(I like you..)

Tycoon thug, he made a ten thousand dollar investment
Now he's not to be messed with, makes the girls get undressed quick
He's on some big muscled chest shit, posted by the exit
That's my man, he's the owner, yeah he be on some next shit
Said we'll make a few million by the next millenium
Told me to keep droppin jewels like a triggerman, puttin lead in him
Like Flavor said, I tell these hoes to, kill the noise
You know your Pops told you, watch them New York boys
All night, the ladies be like up in my mug
Tranquilin and trance dancin up in my drug
Fly honies, they hold me down like always
The same cat that used to get blunted down in the hallways
I love the cutie pies, never the doodie pies
I got discipline, I want the crew to rise
Situations like this'll make you think twice
Instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life
Baby won't you take the time (uh-huh)
Let me know what's on your mind (your mind)
Just because I'm yours don't make it right
(don't make it right)
Baby won't you take the time (bay-bee..)
Let me know what's on your mind (I'm waiting..)
Slow down baby now let's make it right (on your love..)
(I like you..)

Ladies, here's somethin that we should be considerin
Things could get bitter when, you don't use discipline
Imaginin yourself livin lavish and plush
Hangin with the cat who be spendin cabbage and buyin stuff
However, don't be too clever with your endeavor
And don't let too many men, receive your treasure
Most cats, be thinkin with they bozack
I admit in the past I was tryin to break these hoes backs
Escape, without givin up a dime
You know them fly ladies had a good fuckin time
Coppin me some Timberland with a jacket to match it
Girls nowadays wanna pigeon for chickenscratch
And I ain't givin up nathan
Long as my game expands, it's my discipline to hate 'em
Situations like this, will make you think twice
That's why instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life
And just because I want to it don't mean I will
And just because I'm angry it don't mean I'd kill
And just because she looks good, it don't mean I'd hit it
And just because I'm horny, it don't mean I'm widdit
Just because I make records, don't mean that I'm gassed
And just because I'm rappin, don't mean I chase ass
And just because I'm whylin, don't mean I can't stop
I got discipline baby whether you do or not
Baby won't you take the time (the time)
Let me know what's on your mind (your mind)
Just because I'm yours don't make it right
(just because I'm yours)
Baby won't you take the time (bay-bee..)
Let me know what's on your mind (I'm waiting..)
Slow down baby now let's make it right (on your love..)

"What, you wanna battle me?!"
"Yo, man, how much money you got?"
"What, you wanna battle me?!"
"Yo, man, how much money you got?"

I used to guzzle 40's and own a beat up Caddy
Since the hood still love me, I'll turn the heat up, Daddy
I went from mackin' fly honeys on the train
To straight relaxin' on the beach, countin' money, gettin' brain
Soon as you rappers get a chance you wanna floss a lot
You buy a iced out watch because it cost a lot
Then you in the club, stylin' with dough
Profilin' with hoes that we boned a while ago
You rookies haven't done enough laps around the track
You had one hot single, but then your album sounds wack
Son, you bore me with your war stories
You ain't even do that shit, so that's just more stories
How you expect us to take you seriously?
The look in my eye, punk, has got you scared of me
I'm blastin' your sons, I'm snatchin' your funds
You catch a royal ass-whoopin', you've been askin' for one

"'Bout to slap rappers around and bruise the game"
"What, what?"
"We thorough to the end"
"Yo, man…" "You know the drill"
"'Bout to slap rappers around and bruise the game"
"What, you wanna battle me?!"
"Yo, man, how much money you got?"
Bitch, you don't even know the half about me
I bring it straight to your chest, ask your staff about me
I'm just a little bit older, plus a whole lot wiser
I might advise ya, or I might pulverize ya
I can visit any city, get respect in the street
While you alone in your room, shook to death of the streets
I'll take a second to speak, I keep my weapon in reach
I ain't talkin' romance, but you'll get swept off your feet
I keeps a ghetto chick that loves to blast and she peddle shit
Groupies fake moves, I get her to settle shit
You can't compare to the status right here
Legendary worldwide, we can battle right here
Listen, Junior, I'ma tear back your wig
This ain't TV, but I'll show you what a "fear factor" is
Stop grillin' me, and all that frontin' is killin' me
You leave me no choice but to hurt your feelings, G

"'Bout to slap rappers around and bruise the game"
"What, you wanna battle me?!"
"Yo, man, how much money you got?"
"What, what?" "We thorough to the end"
"Yo, man…" "You know the drill"
"'Bout to slap rappers around and bruise the game"
"'Bout to slap rappers around and bruise the game"
"We thorough to the end"
"'Bout to slap rappers around—"
"We thorough to the end"
"You know the drill"
"'Bout to slap rappers around and bruise the game"

You know I used to be a player, fly girl layer and a heartbreaker
Lovemaker, backbreaker but then I made a
Mistake yes I fell in love with this ill chick
Sweatin' me for money, my name and the dilsnick
My homeboys told me drop her cuz it would be to my benefit
She used to say I'd better quit hanging with those derelicts
Romancing is my thing but I can't swing with no scheming hoes
Wherever my Beemer goes you know that I'm driving
Surviving in the 90's is a must so I trust
That everyone listen up as my vocals give thrust
I bust my rhymes first never chasing a skirt
Do much work while other suckas need more time to rehearse
Now back to the ex-girls, ex-lovers, ex-friends
It made me mad to find that she was only after my ends
She phones me and goes on about her new life now
I wish she knew right now
I think she's busted let's discuss it
When I was with her no trust, just fights
Just the he-say-she-say and the neighborhood highlights
Now I got my new girl or as I say my baby doll
But I'm still gettin' crazy calls, my ex-girl's got balls
Don't wanna play the field cuz I get lovin' at home base
Don't gimme no long face just exit with grace
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl cuz I'm on with the next girl
(Sample x6) Cuz girls look so good
Next x5

She had much loot, liked to buy me fresh-dipped gear
Liked to have me near cuz of my savoir faire
The time we shared was brief cuz I needed relief
From her high-classed antics and all her conceit
Now she's crying wolf and I like don't wanna hear that
I told her the bear facts when things started out
She whines and she pouts about how I did her bad, yo
But she tried to buy me
Even tempt me with the hiney
I fell for a sec cuz the clothes were real fly
I could almost feel I
Would give into her whims
Her thoughts were erratic, sporadic, crazy in nature
I told her hey look yo, I can no longer date ya
Tried to pimp with bank and fell short, your ship sank
Many thanks for the time and the watch and the link
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, nuff respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl cuz I'm straight with the next girl

(Sample x4) Cuz girls look so good
Next x3
You saw my moms in the supermarket and gave her your number
You asked her how's my sister then asked her how's my brother
Didn't ask about my father cuz you know he ain't like ya
Every time I left for your crib he'd really get hyper
The advice he used to give me makes much sense now
I can't believe I used to let you break my confidence down
You used to ask me why the hell did I wanna live in Brooklyn?
You messed up my flow although you were good-lookin'
Yes darling was fly and this was the problem
Cuz back in the day she had me scheming and robbin'
To get her things to wear so when she went to the club
All eyes were on her and who, me? I just bugged
Caught in between feeling proud and feeling more like a sucker
Had to go undercover, get away, and find another
Been in Brooklyn 9 years and been around the world, too
I've seen so many fly girls and I knew just what to do
I went from ex- to next took my time with each one
And you know they still love me so stop jellin' me hon
I went home to see my moms and I saw you at the bus stop
Must I stop? Nah, I think not
You and I are the past c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl & I'm out with the next girl
Out...

Word up
This goes out to you
Mary Parker, Loretta Randall
Grandfather Bill
Runy Manuel, Robert N'Blangio
Uncle C, Alicia Elon
Giovanni

To my man G.O.V., I remember how you used to be
You were the illest man alive now I'm reading your eulogy
Eyes so serious, you told me hold my head
Pursue this rap shit and go forward never backwards
While you gripped TECs tight, and ran niggas out of town
I ripped up mics, showin wack niggas how to sound
Still your essence, was callin
By two gunshots, at close range, your frame had fallen
Now like a angel you've risen
And you will stay in my heart, and yo I wish you were still livin
Word... this is in memory of

Zachary Bro, Cousin Paula
Harry O-Fives "Rest in peace"
Yeah, Sam-O, 183rd
Joshua Faust "Rest in peace"
Brian Brown y'all, yeah
To my man Brian B, I remember how you used to be
You were the flyest in the club with three bitches doin rub-a-dub
You was the pimp of all panderers
GQ, Johnny Presley, fuckin up the elegances
So many hookers on your schedule
Slammin Cadillac doors and mackin whores on the regular
You used to boost, the slickest of suits
Climbin through the back windows on the bus, you was ill Dukes
Until that chick you vicked, for the Cutlass
Started snillz-niffin ki-daine, and went to cut cha
That freak shanked you six times in your sleep
I wish you was here, cause your philosophy was mad deep
Yeah... this is in memory of

Keith 'Cowboy', Scott La Rock
Prince Messiah "Rest in peace"
Buffy, the Human Beatbox y'know
2Pac Shakur "Rest in peace"
Pink House, Sub Roc
O.G. Boo Bang, salute! "Rest in peace"
Seagram's, Killa Black from Mobb Deep
Biggie Smalls, yeah rest in peace
Lance Owens y'all
To all my brothers doin time, whether or not you did the crime
You know the system is devised to keep you deaf, dumb and blind
Like Scarface said, them cats are smart
In order for things to change we must all play a part
It's easy for us to blame society
But now it's way too late, and we must take responsibility
To all my brothers in the streets
I know you feel you gotta hustle cause your peeps gotta eat
Makin moves right and exact
Don't wanna see you layin flat, don't wanna see ya catch a bullet black
If we don't build we'll be destroyed
That's the challenge we face in this race of poor and unemployed
Freud, a philosopher, but I'm a realist
So philosophize this, without love we won't exist
To those who passed out there, in the deserts and the jungles
With pain on their shoulders, and heavy bundles
I pray each one will ascend to new heights and new enlightenment
And this is why I'm writin it
Yeah... this is in memory of

Linnet Grinnich, Cookie Murray
Yeah "Rest in peace"
Ross, Laverne La-La Eyelif
John Hood "Rest in peace"
Kevin Fredricks, Donny Charles
Leslie Clark, and Will Clark "Rest in peace"
Tommy Saunders, Princess Di
Don Clark, Betty Shabazz "Rest in peace"
This is in memory of...
"Rest in peace"EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
