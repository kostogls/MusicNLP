Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Come on, now

If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home) She can be
18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicy-thicy-thic girl you know that it's on
(You know that it's on) I peep something
Coming towards me on the dance floor, sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
"So when Nelly, can we go?" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements was 36-25-34, yelling
"I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there"
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now, making a living off my brain
Instead of 'caine now, I got the title from my
Momma put the whip in my own name now, damn shit done
Changed now, running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White, c'mon
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E

(Hey, must be the money!)

Check, check, yo
I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won’t believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: "I can't help ya"
"But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?"
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!
Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why, why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should, fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, "wishing you was" niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Chrissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty wanna... knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty wanna... rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty wanna... pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring, know they diss
Honies looking all "they wish," come on boo, gimme kiss, c'mon

If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)

Hot shit (Hot shit)

Mmmmm, I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
(Come on!)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
(Hot Shit)
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Mmmmm, you can find me in St. Louis rolling on dubs
Smoking on dubs in clubs, blowing up like Cocoa Puffs
Sipping Bud', getting perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, accumulated enough scratch just to
Navigate it, wood decorated on chrome and it's
Candy painted, fans fainting while I'm entertainin'
Wild, ain't it? How me and money get acquainted
I hang with Hannibal Lecter (Hot shit!)
So feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud (What?), I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause, I'm righteous, above the law
Player my style's raw, I’m Born to Mack, like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame and the glamour, give me D's with a rubber hammer
My grammar be's Ebonics, gin, tonic, and chronic
Fuck Bionic, it's ironic, slamming niggas like Onyx
Lunatics till the day I die
And I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics
I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover

Pound niggas, what you be giving when I'm around nigga
Frown niggas, talking that shit when I leave the town, nigga
Say now, can you hoes come out to play now?
Hey, I'm ready to cut you up any day now
Play by my rules, boo, and you gon' stay high
May I answer your Third Question like A.I
Say hi, to my niggas left in the slamma
From St. Louis to Memphis, from Texas back up to Indiana
Chi-Town, K.C., Motown to Alabama
L.A., New York Yankee niggas, to Hotlanta
Louisiana, all my niggas with "Country Grammar"
Smoking blunts in Savannah, blow thirty mil', like I'm Hammer

Millions so you niggas quit acting silly, mon
Kid quicker than Billy, mon, talking really and I need it mon
Flows, I kick 'em freely mon, especially off Remi, mon
Keys to my Beemer, mon, holler at Beenie Man
See me, mon, chiefin', rollin' deeper than any mon
Through Jennings mon, through U-City back up to Kingsland
With nice niggas, sheist niggas who snatch yo' life, niggas
Trife niggas who produce and sell the same beat twice, nigga

From broke to having brokers, my price-range is Rover
Now I'm knocking like Jehovah; let me in now, let me in now
Bill Gates, Donald Trump, let me in now
Spend now, I got money to lend my friends now
We in now, candy Benz, Kenwood and 10's now

Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream

I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot, now she found her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it
Knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My love of my life
My shorty, my wife
She left me, I'm tight
'Cause I knew that it just ain't right

Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream
When I be riding man I swear I see her face at every turn
Trying to get my Usher on but I can't let it Burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn - for
More and more, I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream

If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone
And you wishing you could give them everything
Everything (heyyy)
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone
And you wishing you could give them everything
Uhh, uhh, uhh

Got thirty down at the bottom, thirty more at the top (Uh-huh)
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks

If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changin' grills every day, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (Oh) in my white tee (Oh)
Or on South Beach (Oh) in my wife beat'
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see, my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
'Cause when I...
Open up your mouth, your grill gleaming (Say what?)
Eyes stay low from the chiefing (Chiefing)
I got a grill I call penny candy, you know what that mean?
It look like Now and Laters, gumdrops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave you for nothing, only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood

I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath (Already)
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling, showing off my diamonds, sippin' on some potent oil (Baby)
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats, thirty stacks, let 'em know I'm so for real (For real)
My motivation is them 30 pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouthpiece simply symbolize success (That's right)
I got the wristwear and neckwear that's captivating (What?)
But it's my smile that got these onlookers spectating (Hah)
My mouthpiece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad (Come on, man)
My teeth are mind-blowing, giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman 'cause I'm sellin' everybody grills
Smile for me, daddy (Woo, what you looking at? Uh)

Ya, ya grill (Uh), ya, ya, ya grill
Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em, "Make me a grill," she said

Gipp got them yellows, got them purples, got them reds (Hey)
Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head (Hey)
You can catch me in my Too $hort drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box
It's what it do, in the Lou', ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks and the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em, you can spot 'em on the top and the bottom
Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham
I ain't dissin' nobody, but let's bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white (That's right)
These hoes can't focus 'cause they eyesight blurry
Tippin' on some 4's, you can see my mouth jewelry
I got four different sets, it's a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same, got my name in the mold
Add a whole top diamond and the bottom rose gold (Come on)
Smile for me, daddy (Woo, what you looking at? Uh)
Let me see your grill (Let you see my what?)
Ya, ya grill (Uh), ya, ya, ya grill

Big boys

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' about 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I damn near shot 'em

Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; may niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops

Me? I like the limited edition in khaki and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at
Don't get me wrong, man
Now Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some, man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You may not have three or four
But you got one, man (big boy)

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

We up in Foot Locker; I'm lookin' like I need those
Ten in a half and if you got 'em give me two of those
I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo'
Cause she's just standin' there as if I'm shootin' free throws
I said, "Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes"
She said, "I love you Murph, especially in the white 'n blue"
I said, The white 'n blue sound nice make it twice"
And I signed an (yo) autograph (yo), "Thanks for the advice"

I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers, the Broncos, the orange and blue
I like 'em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops, which the clear sole
But it's Timb's and fat laces when it's cold
But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all purpose wit' them lil' dots in the toe
Ain't nothin' stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho'
On dem Nike Air Force, "NE" behind the "O"
O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces and put wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh, with electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin in
(Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, they know I'm buyin dem

Now don't nothing get the hype on first sight like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em, I gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose, ya heard me, kinda like my Daytons

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones
I wore spurs at first now there's tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem

Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all (you wildin') fish bowlin 'em all
(I got some fifteens) security buyin shoes and all

Now sometimes I get em free and some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
Gimme the black and the platinum, and leather gray
Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)

Now in the box is where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine (peep mine)
Maybe once or twice but never three times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love Pumas and shell toes
But can't nothin compare to a fresh crispy white pearl

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones

You better watch who you talkin bout; runnin your mouth, like you know me
You gon' fuck around and show why the "Show Me" get called the "Show Me"
Why one-on-one you can't hold me if your last name was Hanes
Only way you wear me out is stitch my name on your pants
No resident of France; but you swear I'm from Paris
Hundred-six karats - total? Naw that's per wrist
Trying to compurr this - my chain to yo' chain
I'm like Sprint or Motorola - no service, out of your range
You out of your brains, thinkin I'mma shout out your name
You gotta come up with better ways than that to catch your fame
All that pressure you applyin it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blindside takin your sleeves off
As much as we's floss, still hard to please boss
Don't be lyin bitchin and cryin - suck it up as a loss
Cause your, acts is wack, your whole label is wack
And matter fact, eh eh-eh eh a-hold that

I.. am..  #1 - no matter if you like it
Here take it sit down & write it
I.. am.. number one
Hey hey hey hey hey hey - now let me ask you man
What does it take to be #1?
2 is not a winner and three nobody remembers (hey)
What does it take to be #1?
Hey hey hey hey..
Do you like it when I shake it for ya, daddy? Move it all around?
Let you get a peep before it touches the ground?
Hell yeah ma I love a girl that's willin to learn
Willin to get in the driver's seat and willin to turn
And not concerned about that he say, she say, did he say
What I think he said? Squash that, he probably got that off eBay
Or some, Internet access some, website chat line
Mad cause I got mine, don't wind up on the flat line
Ohh if my uncle could see me now
If he could see how many rappers wanna be me now
Straight emulatin my style right to the "down down"
Can't leave out the store now better wait 'til they calm down
I got hella shorties, comin askin, "Yo where the party?"
Ohh lordy - will I continue to act naughty?
Mixing Cris' and Bacardi, got me thinkin fo' sho'
I'm not a man of many words but there's one thing I know - Pimp

I.. am.. number one - no matter if you like it
Here take it sit down and write it
Hey I.. am.. number one
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

What does it take to be number one?
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Check it, uhh, check, yo
Aiyyo I'm tired of people judgin what's real Hip-Hop
Half the time you be them niggas who fuckin album flop
YOU KNOW! Boat done sank and it ain't left the dock
C'MON! Mad cause I'm hot; HE JUST - mad cause he not
You ain't gotta gimme my props, just gimme the yachts
Gimme my rocks, and keep my fans comin in flocks
'Til you top the Superbowl, keep your mouth on lock
Shhhhh.. {*crickets*} I'm awake, ha ha ha!
I'm cocky on the mic but I'm humble in real life
Taking nothin for granted blessin e'rything on my life
Trying to see a new light at the top of the roof
Baby name not Sigel but I speak The Truth
I heat the booth - Nelly actin so uncouth
Top down shirt off in the coupe, spreadin the loot
With my family and friends, and my closest of kin
And I'll do it again if it means I'mma win

Hey
Dirty I.. am.. number one - no matter if you like it
Here take it sit down and write it
I..I..I am.. number one

I used to pride myself on being the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man
Why can't you understand that anything I'm offering
I gave you the world, but you just wanted arguing
From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped you off again
Even if flipped out on me at the mall again
"It's all his fault again," that's what you're telling all your friends
I ain't pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again
See how your day going I know they stressing on you
I know them times get hard that's why I'm checking on you
It's yours truly ma, I got a little message for you
Anything he can do, girl I can do better for you, 'cause

When we laugh or we cry, it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me (come and go with me)
Oh girl, come on over to my place (my place, my place)
Won't you sit yourself down and take a seat
And let me ease your mind girl, we gon' do it our way (our way)
I heard your friend tell a friend that told a friend of mine
That you was thinking that we should do it one more time
If this ain't the truth then hopefully it's not a lie
'Cause I ain't got no issue with hitting that another time
We never had a problem with getting it done
Disagreed upon a lot ma, but the sex wasn't one
Now check it I know you get excited (still) when I come around and bite it
(Girl) quit frowning up and quit acting like you don't like it
(I like it) I know you like, (I like it)
You really like it, (I really, really like it)
(I want it), I know you want it, (adore it)
Adore it, (so come let me enjoy it)

When we laugh or we cry, it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me (come and go with me)
Oh girl, come on over to my place (my place, my place)
Won't you sit yourself down and take a seat
And let me ease your mind girl, we gon' do it our way (our way)
Shorty, where you been?
Feels like a long time
Long, long time since I seen you
Yes it has, girl
And I know I said some fucked-up things to you before
But girl you know I didn't mean it
(I'm sorry)
I never meant one single word
If I could take back every word I would and more for sure
If I thought that you would believe it
(Would you believe it?)
Hey, girl, 'cause you make my life so convenient for me

When we laugh or we cry, it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me (let's go, let's go)
Oh girl, come on over to my place (get back home to my place)
Won't you sit yourself down and take a seat
And let me ease your mind girl, we gon' do it our way (shorty)

Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever, it's forever
When we laugh or we cry, it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever, it's forever

Shorty, where you been?
Feels like a long time
Long, long time since I seen you
Yes it has, girl
And I know I said some fucked-up things to you before
But girl you know I didn't mean it
I never meant one single word
If I could take back every word I would and more for sure
If I thought that you would believe it
Hey, girl, 'cause you make my life so convenient for me, wooo!2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Welcome ladies and gentlemen
This is Mark, oh-who-gives-a-fuck from '93 TV
This is my co-host, Bob Buttafuoco
(Hey hey guys) Yeah, yeah, yeah
We got a crowd that's in a frenzy Bob
Let's go down to the announcers for the start of the game
And now.. please rise for the singing of our national anthem!

Mmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

I'm the first to swing
Home run with that give-me-what-you-got thing, hot wings
Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what
I put my mack down, she throw a curve ball
She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, god livin; like a worst race
First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Sittin' strong, skipped third base and headed home
Third baseman just don't understand, baby, where the bong
What the fuck wrong, with this world today?
With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way
You wasn't fuckin' with me, leave, for the wrap that's in my seed
Now you stays on yo knees cause we's be in the big league
'Cause we's be in the big league
Mmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

Well you should see me now, I'm eatin' Wheaties now
I'm stealin' second and third, lookin' home, gettin' greedy now
See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for runnin' the quickest miles
Hit and run in any town, any ground
Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thang
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain
I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

Mmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, huh, batter up
Well uhh this next young batter on deck
He's still in high school (yeah, I heard that)
(It's a great day though)
A good high school out in U-City of St. Louis, Missouri
(I think his name's umm, who knows
Mur-uhh, Murphey Lee or somethin)

I want my name not, not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams, dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'm a sixteen-year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you somethin' now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rappin'
Money, money, money, money what's happenin'
I'm comin' up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with, you know how we do
We do, we do, we do, we do, we do

Mmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, huh, batter up2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Uh, uh, uh
Uh uh uh uh uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh uh uh uh uh
Uh, uh, uh uh uh uh huh uh uh (woo!)
Uh uh, uh

Ayo ma, how you doin'? It's your son now
And I picked up the mic and put the drugs down
Now I'm tryin' to do some things that'll make you proud
Instead of every time I call it's to bail me out
Oh why didn't I listen to things you used to tell me?
Knowin' that everything that you said would never fail me
Like they got plans for ya, ain't nothin' I can do
When them laws get they hands on you, but I ain't listenin'
Even payin' attention, I'm just tryna get mine
Takin' advantage, you workin' two jobs at the same time
Ungrateful, complainin' about Nike and Polo signs
But you always come through, and what do I do
I wreck both your cars, stole money from your drawers
Sold dope out your yard, stayed into with them laws
Tryin' to pay you back for all the stress that I caused
And always be there to give you whatever you want

(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said whatever you need
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said you don't have to work no more
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh, 'cause ya son will be there for you
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh
Now verse two, yeah that's for you boo
I send you props 'cause you the only one that stuck through
When I'm upset and stressed you give me back rubs
When I'm depressed you give me head off in the bathtub (E-I!)
On your P's and Q's, on your Q's and P's
You hear my beeper goin' off and you just throw me my keys
Ain't even askin' me yo is it coochie or G's
And for that reason girl you can ask me for anything
Not a for real smoker but you choke with me
Not too hot about the drinkin' but you toast with me
Livin' at your granny house you kept the dope for me
And wouldn't hesitate to go to court for me
Need money? My boo'll go and work the avenue
My boo'll fuck you up if I ask her to
That's why I do the things I do
And I will always be there to give you whatever you want

(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said whatever you need
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said I don't wanna lose you, no
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh, 'cause you're my boo and my only one
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh
I'm doin' this one here for Shaun Haynes, Lashando and J.D
D Quick, Boo Gees and Fatty
My nigga Lil' Erv, Gino and Poochie
And everybody over on Euclid and Labade
Young Big Touch, Pooh and Big Baby
Rio, J.T. and Big Money
Herky Jerk, Wezz and Pea and Cody
J.E., K-Ug and Odie
Toe-Fa, M.J., and Colby
And all my soldiers down at Fair Ground on Monday
My Lunatic fam, Kyjuan, Murphy Lee
City Spud, T-Love and Big 'Li
Yellow Mack, Slow Down, Courtney B
The rest of my niggas up in the N.Y.C
And without Trail, Cooter and Coach it just wouldn't be
And I will always be there to give you whatever you want

(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said whatever you need
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, 'cause y'all my niggas for life you know
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh, you can always smoke with me
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh, uh
(If you feel it, pop it and lock it)
Just like that, you know
Anybody else I forgot, in the city
(If you feel it, pop it and lock it)
North side (if you feel me, pop it and lock it)
South side, all the shorties, you know who you are
All the BC's, you know who you are
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
I ain't got to give shouts out to everybody, y'all know5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
