Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life
Played some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing
Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie
Heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got L.A. unified
You better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us
See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus
Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up
Tax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg, fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'
How are niggas s'posed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walkin' 'round the crib like, "Why a nigga can't live?
Get this money, fuck these bitches though?"
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like:
"We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical"
This my city, nigga, everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four-pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one
Thank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors
To every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans
If I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one

Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil' Snupe, I was Meek Mill
Niggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though
Can't think, so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figuero'
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, "Here it go"
Screamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter, dawg, cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid

Get my people out them chains, nigga

Put my hands up? Fuck you sayin', bruh?
'Cause I'm a black man in a Phantom
Or is it 'cause my windows tinted?
Car cost 300 thou' and I blow Indo in it (2 Chainz!)
You mad 'cause your daughter fuck with me on spring break
Well, I'ma fuck her till the springs break
Yeah, roll another one 'cause I'm winnin'
In my four-door, lookin' real photogenic
Gentleman attire, in threads that won't expire
I'm in a class of my own, my teacher got fired
Money gettin' long, pussy rate keep risin'
Versace outfit cost me 3,000
From the P houses, did it from the wee hours
Sellin' that chicken; no lemon pepper, no sweet and sour
First you get the power, then you get respect
I'm gettin' so much money I can buy your bitch
Take it how you wanna, if you wanna take it
I like clubs where all the women workin' naked
Fell in love with a waitress—what the fuck I'm thinkin'?
Bought that ho a ring, it was for her pinky
Uhn, that's pimpin', that's slick
Got a bottle of cologne that cost more than your rent
Fuck y'all mad at me for? Got a black card and a black Phantom
With a white bitch in Idaho, I do the same thing in (Montana)
Got a thick bitch in Atlanta, got a redbone in the Chi
Got two chains, they two-tone, two hundred racks, no lie

Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
I'm 'bout to rumble in the jungle in these new Kanye's
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
My lawyer threw them gloves on and beat another case

Fuck y'all mad at me for, 'cause my belt got two G's on it?
Her bag got two C's on it? My daughter's stroller got D's on it?
Free Big Meech, free Boosie and C-Murder
Like New Orleans, like Baltimore, come to Compton you'll see murders
And my AR see murders, that's beef, nigga; no burgers
I'm insane and you Usain, nigga better turn on them burners
Got coke swimmin' in that glass jar, bitch, go turn on them burners!
Got dope to sell in this hotel, no half price, no retail
You a bitch nigga; no female, I smack niggas; Sprewell
I'm on the block like D12, I got the white; no D-12
Like a little nigga in Africa, I was born totin' that K
And that's real shit, no Will Smith and no Nona Gaye
But they yellin'…
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Thank God that a nigga seen another day
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Got a chopper and a bottle—fuck it, let 'em spray!

I take my case to trial, hire the Dream Team
Robbie Kardashian, Johnnie Cochran; I seen things
I dream big, I think sharp
Inhale smoke, Hawaiian tree bark
Humble yourself, you not a G, keep it one with yourself
Run to niggas for help, favors I keep one on the shelf
I got rifles with lasers, swing it just like the majors
Hit you right above navel
Now you swimmin' in pavement
Gold medals on my neck, I call it Michael Phelps
Hoes settlin' for less, I call 'em bottom shelf
Niggas tough on them blogs and never did nothin' at all
On the road to the riches, bitches not taggin' along

Unless it's ass in a thong, hit that ass and I'm gone
Disrespect my nigga Boss and I'm flashin' the chrome
I'm wavin' the TEC, Tity sprayin' the MAC
Extendos in the back, gonna lap
I got a bitch that look like Laila Ali sittin' in my lap
Got a call from Skateboard, pick 'em up at LAX
Speakin' skateboards, where Tune at? Fuck with him
I'll break a skateboard on a nigga back, 2 Chainz!
Skateboard on a nigga track
No lie, "No Lie" already got a plaque
Mama got a house, daughter got accounts
Just to think a nigga like me started with a ounce
Bad bitches and D-boys, we bring 'em out
If them niggas pussy, we douche 'em, we clean 'em out
This the voice of ghetto intelligence. If you got work
Go to work, don't work at your residence

…For presidents
Word to Muhammad, that triple beam is heaven-sent
Ridin' through the jungles in that mothafuckin' elephant
That's a gray Ghost, with the ears on it
Swimmin' through the hood like it got fins on it (Tell 'em!)
You know I got that work on the foreman grill
Weigh the mothafuckas in, made another mil
Got a nigga feelin' like Cassius Clay
Thrilla in Manilla, nigga want it, whip his ass today

Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Thank God that a nigga seen another day
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Got a chopper and a bottle—fuck it, let 'em spray!

***
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, "Check, check out my melody"
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
10 G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe in me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali
With my Jacob on, see how time fly?

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think, "What if Marie Baker got that abortion?" I love you, ma

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P

Mars..
(Bitch I'm a motherfuckin' martian)

Blood gang kill 'em all, Odd Future Wolf Gang
Kidnap a vampire, drain all his fuckin veins
Wolf Grey Jordans, use his intestines for the strings
Snatch up Rihanna and throw her in front of a fuckin' train
Sniff a fucking unemployment line of cocaine
Tie Lil B up to a full tank of propane
Swag, now watch him cook...and just stand there and look
Have a bonfire with old Harry Potter books
Martians vs. Goblins, goons vs. the crooks
And since me and Tune had Viacom shook
I shoulda got a real-ass pirate to do the hook
Maybe Jack Sparrow maybe Peter Pan's nemesis
My power's limitless like Blanka on Sega Genesis
Superhero, mad that Marvel overlooked me
Cause Spiderman and Hulk straight pussy

Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
We are not the same, I am a Martian
A year ago, I was poor, somewhat
Now my future's brighter than Christopher's new haircut
Bruno Mars is still sucking dick and fucking male butts
In the same closet that Tyler Perry gets clothes from
I suck? Where the fuckin Ring Pops?
You got a better chance of getting a copy of Detox
Wolf Gang, we rock, crack rock and that shit was expected
Like Jayceon whenever he name-drop (Fuck you, Tyler)
Jesus, motherfucking Theresa
This nigga Game got Wolf Haley for this feature
My team is running shit like we have full-cleat Adidas
Getting chased by the polices on a full bred Cheetah
Bishop Eddie caught me tryna escape
Bag full of drag and a Nicki Minaj mixtape
Dragging all you fags to the back of the log cabin
Fall back like Lebron's hairline against the Mavericks, he lost

Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
We are not the same, I am a Martian

(Chuck, fuck wit' me) I do
Cause Lil Tunechi always bless me (achoo)
He killed me on my own track, so what? Not you
Fuck you, I spit like I had kids with Erykah Badu
I fucked her on the day of that naked video shoot
I was sucking that pussy like it was wonton soup
Then I hit Lebron's mom in bron-bron's coupe
With Delonte West taping, we had bon-bons too
With Cleveland cheerleaders, they had pom-poms too
So I smacked them bitches wearing Bishop Don Juan's suit
(Where was Snoop?) I don't know, probably doing what the Crips do
But when I'm with my uncle, fuck it! Then I'm a Crip too
And I will Crip Weezy, Crip Jones, and Crip you
Now I'm the Doggfather, walking with a Shih Tzu
Mad that DC comics overlooked me
Cause Captain America's straight pussy
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)

See any angels in the city
See any angels in the city
See any angels in the city

Tell them mothafuckas I'm forever paid
California king, wrestle gators in that Everglade
Drive up out that mothafuckin' swamp in the Escalade
So before you put that red rag in your pocket
I wanna see your fuckin' résumé
Started off on Ground Zero, then I start to levitate
Rip rappers a new asshole – I never hesitate
Dre Beats on, smokin' that chronic just to meditate
I'ma give 'em hurricanes until another levee break
You niggas is featherweight, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight
Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate
When a nigga Wack found me, shit, I was sellin' weight
Now a nigga's sellin' millions, now it's time to celebrate
Performin' in front of millions, nigga, every race
6-4 in the '64, now watch the Chevy scrape
Fourth album, no five mics? Then let 'em hate!
But I'm not stoppin' till I'm the fuckin' king in every state
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me
I'm sick of mothafuckas talkin' about "the West died"
Can't you hear my heart beatin'? That's the motherfuckin' Westside
You test me, you test God, I'm His son
It say in Psalms, you come at me
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun
You won't have no time to run
I'm from the Compton slums, and that's how the West ride
I'm from the city where two of the best died
Rest in peace to both of 'em, spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Damn, I said I spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Name your top 10, I'm harder than the most of 'em
Matter of fact, shorten your list, nigga, top 5
Game, Biggie, Hov… probably Pac, Nas
No particular order, bet a mill' that I slaughter
And serve niggas, give a fuck what you ordered
How dare you niggas pop fly
When I'm the nigga sold 5 mill' out the gate and numbers do not lie
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me
I gave you The Documentary, shit was a classic
Gave you Doctor's Advocate, you ripped it out the package
Came with LAX, since critics said it was average
I was stressed the fuck out, torn between Aftermath and
Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope
Spill the red ink on the paper, it's like my pen is broke
And this is what you all been waitin' for
I'm the lost angel knockin' on Satan's door
What the fuck y'all take me for?
I love you ‘cause you hate me more
I'm Kobe on the Lakers floor, except I give you 84
Shake you like Haiti's floor
Walk up on you, like, "What's goin' on, baby boy?"
Shots in that Mercedes door
Either I'm crazy or the black Slim Shady or
Could that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more?
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
The best the West has ever seen, no disrespect to Calvin
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me
Kendrick, and I wear pendant on my shoulder
Soldier, like a lieutenant
And the coupe tinted, got pulled over
Johnny always lock a nigga down, knowin' damn well
We don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size
Ride like Pac in his prime; Thug Life is now on radar
'Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscin' when the L.A. Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickridin'
I'm addicted to Westsidin'
Livin' in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turned me to a lion
Tryin'… and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city where a nigga hadn't seen that shit
"Compton!" – a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, never TV-screened that shit
Can't block or screen that shit
Now everybody sing that shit!

Red is a very emotionally and intense color. It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure. It has a very high visibility, which is why stop signs, stop lights, and fire equipments are usually painted red. It also represents one third of California's gang population. Needless to say, please dress accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area. Also, tuck your jewellry, and keep your hands inside your vehicle. Thank you! Enjoy it!51EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Anticipatin', I’m feelin' your body
Hopin' that you would just give me a chance
Goddamn, babe, just hold your glass up for this toast
My cash up and yo ass up and I'm the one that's tippin' the most
Tonight, on the Westside
And if you wanna roll, have the best fuckin night of your life
No lie, no lie
Me and you together, girl, I’m celebratin' you tonight
Uh, yeah, I’m blown, no cigarillo, 'rillo
Love when I'm mellow, get on my level, 101 karats in my bezel
I’m on, like soon as the ice cream truck at the ghetto
Little knucklehead always in trouble
Soon as I ask shawty her number, fasho
Yeah, I get it, then I'm gone, then I hit it like bone, bone
Now you fuckin' up my zone, my zone, my zone
Said she wait when daddy come home
Told me she ain't got nothin' on
I’m talkin' no th-thong, thong, thong (Haha)
Yeah, she throwin' that ass back
Hard as a bat, sit on my lap
Fuckin' with me, ain't nothin' better than that
That’s a fact, that's a fact?
Don’t act Hollywood 'cause I don’t act
'Bout my business but I don’t slack
This my celebration rap, so

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high
We having a celebration, love to stay high, yeah
We having a celebration, love to stay high
Uh, I pour up for Pimp C, light up for Soulja Slim
Straight out the gutter, with the rest of the bowlin' pins
Money for days, bitches go both ways
On the road to riches, bitch, I got road rage
Got the kush in the swisher, got the pussy, the liquor
Got a silencer on the gun, take it off like a stripper
Yeah, wake up, wake up, I’m goin' at your face, make up
These niggas need stitches 'cause they takin' pay cuts
Man, somebody tell them hoes it's a celebration
All my niggas got guns, no registration
Yeah, now gon' light that weed up
I’m Trukfit tee’d up, hoes down, B's up, Tunechi
Rollin' and chokin' and movin' slow motion, I’m floatin', I'm gone
Put the purp' in the blunt
Rollin' and chokin' and movin' slow motion, I’m floatin', I'm gone
Put the purp' in the blunt, yeah, haha (Young Moolah, baby!)

Punk-ass motherfucker, checkin' shit
What you was gonna do?
Kill me in my sleep, you bitch-ass nigga?
2Pac, Biggie – shut the fuck up!
Fuckin' dogs, barkin' and shit
(Don't shoot, don't shoot!)
Fuck you, nigga!

And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: "You ain't grindin' till you tired."
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

Take me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley
Take me away, like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain, suicide
I'm from a windy city like Do or Die
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces?
‘Cause that's Jesus, people – and Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel
Yeah, like Roc-a-Fella needed Siegel
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle
I need some meditation so I can lead my people
They askin', "Why, why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?"
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?
Answer my question 'fore this bullet leave this Desert Eagle
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: "You ain't grindin' till you tired."
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

We are not the same, I am a Martian
So approach my Phantom doors with caution
You see them 24s spinnin'? I earned 'em
And I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson, ‘cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life, with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn, I know his mama proud; and since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now
And like M.J.B. no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground
I spit crack, and niggas could drive it out of town
Got a Chris Paul mindstate, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty like a Glock without a round
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: "You ain't grindin' till you tired."
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

Walk through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on, me and the devil sharin' chronic blunts
Listenin' to the Chronic album, playin' backwards
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge (Compton, Compton)
Made my grandmother pray for good
It never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
And it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should
With the top back, in my Sox hat
I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: "You ain't grindin' till you tired."
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life46EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Compton, uhh, Dre found me in the slums
Sellin' that skunk, one hand on my gun
I was sellin' rocks when Master P was sayin' "Uhhhh!"
Buck pass the blunt
These G-Unit girls just wanna have, fun
Coke and rum, got weed on the ton
I'm bangin' with my hand up her dress like, uhh
I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs
Whole gang in the front in case a nigga wanna stunt
I put Lamborghini doors on that Escalade
Low pro, so low look like I'm ridin' on blades
In one year mayne, a nigga so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly goin' both ways (ahh!)
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to you just how you like it, girl
You're now rockin' with the best
Tre pound on my hip, Teflon on my chest
They say I'm no good, 'cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
'Cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie-ass bitches, you can kiss my ass

This is how wedo

Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

We wrap up your punk ass, stunt and you done
Homie, it's Game time! You ready? Here it come
Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker crunk
It took two months but 50 got it done
Signed with G-Unit, had niggas like, "Huh?"
Don't try to front, I'll leave your ass slumped
Thinkin' I'm a punk get your fuckin' head lumped
50 got a, gun! Ready? Here it come
Got a sick ven-detta to get this, cheddar
Meet my Be-retta, the drama setter
Sip Ama-retta, my flow sounds better
Than average, on tracks I'm a savage, I damage
Any nigga tryin' to front on my clique (G-Unit!)45EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She got on tights with the leather skin
She a rockstar, bring the heavy metal in
Girl shaped like a coke bottle, Medellín
In love with her 'til she went and let the devil in
She pop pills like medicine
She probably gon' die, it's startin' to be evident
I told her, "Slow down, girl you're heaven-sent"
I'm a thug but I got a heart like Kev and them
And I can't let this girl throw her life away
Kick her dorm room in and told her put the knife away
Took her to the hospital like right away
She a angel with demons, the girl like night and day
Stressed out, parents getting divorced
Girl love 'em both, she ain't tryin' to sit in court
She a square so it's hard to see the angle
And that's why God gave her an guardian angel
It's me, and I'm here for her, swear to God that I'm here for her
Last nigga got her caught up in the airport
She ain't had no pride, so she went and did a year for him
She a ride-or-die, like Eve and them
Make home-cooked meals every evening
Start stripping on the side, now I'm tipping on the side
Love life like Joselin and Stevie and them
Am I wrong for being the best that I can to her?
Takin' her son and tryin' to be a man to him
She don't wanna pray, but I told her put her hands to it
I done came a long way from that tan Buick
Yeah, grandmother would be proud of me
Almost got the devil all the way the fuck out of me
Remember momma knockin' on the door hounding me
Bought her a car and a crib even though she doubted me
(When I wake up every day) even though she doubted me
(I thank the lord that we are safe) even though she doubted me
(Again, yeah) even though she doubted me
(That's why you should pray for me)
That's my momma and I love her with my heart like I love you
If you strugglin', baby daddy ain't takin' care of the kids
Girl, you can get a hug too
I'm here whenever you need me, gon' reach out, it's that easy
I love women, cause without women
Wouldn't none of us niggas be breathin'

Cause I'm diggin' you still, that's real
But na you don't text back and deep down I respect that
Cause even though a nigga wanna tap that shit
I don't wanna be the one to wreck that shit
So, so I fall back, year go by I got more plaques
Just to get a call from you tellin' me you miss me
And you wanna see me next time the tour's back, damn
Well what changed then? She tellin' me a nigga had her caged in
Every time she think about me on the road
She be cryin' realizin' all the places that she ain't been
Well it's cool, I'll pick you up, hold you down, lift you up
These other niggas try and fuck
I'm the only one who cut and still came back to stitch you up
So we fuck, say what? You ain't been home lately

Found her pills in a bag, yo she burned that nigga

Say what? She burned that nigga
Dawg, she burned that nigga
He beat her ass in the crib then he went and did a bid

"And I brought—"
"And I brought—"
"And I brought—dreams"
"—dreams"
"—dreams"
"And I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you"
"I—love you"
"I—love you"
"I-I-I love you"

I woke up out that coma 2001
'Bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin', wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt, and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a ("Dream")
I had visions of makin' a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmakin' and rappin'
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
It's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
'Cause Martin Luther King had a ("Dream")
Aaliyah had a ("Dream"), Left Eye had a ("Dream")
So I reached out to Kanye and ("I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you")
("I—love you"
"I—love you"
"I-I-I love you")

I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mýa
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'Til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
"It's a hard knock life, then you pass away"
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
'Cause a dream is kin to your last breath
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
'Cause Martin Luther King had a ("Dream")
Aaliyah had a ("Dream"), Left Eye had a ("Dream")
So I reached out to Kanye and ("I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you")
("I—love you"
"I—love you"
"I-I-I love you")

The dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin' you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin' on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
'Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece, like a Catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend has just begun
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a ("Dream")
Aaliyah had a ("Dream"), Left Eye had a ("Dream")
So I reached out to Kanye and ("I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you")
("I—love you"
"I—love you"
"I-I-I love you")

This song is dedicated to Yetunde Price
The sister of Venus and Serena Williams
Who was slain during a gang shootout in Compton
Sunday, September 14th, 2003: rest in peace
("I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you")
("I—love you"
"I—love you"
"I-I-I love you")
("And I brought—"
"And I brought—"
"And I brought—dreams"
"—dreams"
"—dreams")

All eyes on ya
Ask you how your week been
Workin' always, let me
Work you out for the weekend
Baby, I'm a beast, uh-huh
Can you tame me?
I'm gon' let it out
Lay you down

Let's get to it
Let me lick you in places you never been licked before
Take you to places you never been before
Like London, Paris, see that Lamborghini outside
We can share it, J and B without the marriage
Horse and carriage, señorita
Snapchat dog filters live from Ibiza
Breakfast on the beach, that mean sex is on the beach
You lookin' like a fruit platter, I'ma bite into your peach
And um, I think about to massage your feet
And um, you got a body, you remind of my Jeep
And um, I must look amazing with you
Cause every time you on my arm I got
All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one I'm missin'
All eyes on me
I don't want your love
We ain't gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck
All eyes on you

'Member when you used to curved me, leave my text message unread?
And every time I asked to see you, you say you goin' to bed
Every time I hit you with the good morning you say you workin'
Now you in my living room twerkin', that's crazy
You wear that body suit, I know you tryna tease me
I put on that Tiller, she'd rather fuck me to Weezy
I remember when your money was young
And you stripped all week just to get the tan Yeezy's
Back when lame niggas hit you with the one liners
All sounding the same like Future and Desiigner
Now that's my vagina, she told me to sshh
We in the Chanel store and

All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one I'm missin'
All eyes on me
I don't want your love
We ain't gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck
All eyes on you
Lookin' at me like you love me
We can do it now or later
She wan' lick on party favorite
On my wave, tryna surf it up
Know we gettin' gnarly, smokin' Marley, burnin' up
Certified with the double-M pullin' up
Tooly got a room, we'll play "Room Up In Here", been here
Girl, you know my intentions
I put you on the wall like a picture
Round after round to decisions
Say you wanna show me what I'm missin'
All the lights low, but we lit up
I don't let you down if I get up
Like you got a man, but you're fed up
But you know when we get together
You want me to say your name, huh?
Karrueche!

All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one I'm missin'
All eyes on me
I don't want your love
We ain't gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck
All eyes on me
All eyes on me14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Fuck out my section, you ain't sitting with me

Who needs Hulk Hogan when you got Sting on this motherfucker?
Less than five albums, Kiss the Ring on this motherfucker
California throne and I'm the King on this motherfucker
I don't wanna hear it – weak ass lyrics
Crying on the hook, thinking we gon' feel it
Old lost ass niggas, voice crack when you talk ass nigga
Rolling blunts for the boss ass niggas
I came in with 'Ye, Jeezy and boss ass niggas
Your Freshman cover a whole bunch of soft ass niggas
Tampon lyricists, evacuate the premises
Mute BET cyphers cause I don't wanna hear that shit
May you rest in piss, you fuck niggas
Ayy Frank Ocean, go ahead and fuck these fuck niggas
(Yeah, they fuck niggas) Ain't no 3 Stacks in your class
Take your Top 10 spot and shove it up your ass, bitch boy
Niggas already fucked your bitch, you bitch boy
And every time you kiss on that ho you suck my dick, you bitch boy
And when you buy that ho a bag that bitch carry my bricks, you bitch boy

I was in the XXL, Red Chucks 'round my neck
I was the G in the Unit, had Buck round my set
Word to the Rhymes, had Busta Bus round my set
Gave Whoo Kid a Glock in case they bust round my set
I'm from Compton where that Glock can't fuck with that Tec
That's on Bompton, 40 Glocc got socked in his neck
This is Spawn in the flesh, you a pawn hit reset
Five in the chest, I'm Makaveli the Don in the vest
Don't say "What's up" when you see me, you a pussy nigga
Strangé, fake ass Kanye, fake ass Weezy
Fake ass jewelry, how I know? I'm at the pawn shop
Nigga better off jacking Flav for his alarm clock
Speaking of time, how much more 'til the Game drop
So you can suck my dick and Complex can count my name drops
I been the underdog, I'm cool in my dog house
Fuck all these pussys, give me any name to call out
Left Aftermath, Dre told me ball out
Stunna put me on a private jet then we balled out
Landed in Miami, met some bitches ate 'em all out
Black Marshall Mathers, time to show 'em what this saw about
"Ying, ying, ying" on a motherfucker
"Ying, ying, ying" on a motherfucker

Bitch, I want my mother fuckin' money back
You only gave me five dollars!
I gave you twenty mother fuckin' dollars!
No, you didn't! You only gave me five dollars!
No, I gave you twenty and I ain't gon' sit here and argue with your flat-ass face, home girl
This is America!
You know, that's the thing about you mother fuckers
Go home!
I ain't goin' no where 'til I get my mother fuckin' change
I will blow this mother fucker up if I don't get my mother fuckin' change
*Speaking Japanese*
*Mocking Japanese*
I want my mother fuckin' change!

What happened in hip-hop that got Pac and Big shot?
The thicks blocks, now every rapper claim he let his clip pop
But even myself tote a gun, and know to run than get shot
I've been there before now I'm fuckin' with Doc
(Dr. Dre: Gotta do them Calvin Broadus numbers)
If not, I pitch rocks, anticipatin' my incarceration
Media think I'm fakin' like Mason, but when it comes to mace
Fuck R. Kelly, I don't take it in the face
I find out who sprayed it, and I'm puttin' you under the pavement
No Buddhist priest, Catholic, or Baptist pastor can save him
I'm far from religious, but I got beliefs
So I put canary yellow diamonds in my Jesus piece
I came back from the dead without a part of my chest
Laid in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest
I waited for 3 years while everybody else dropped
Now I understand why Nas did a song with his pops
I'm Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary
Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary

If I die my niggas
Fuck it, I did a song with Mary Blige, my niggas
Got a hook from Faith, no verse from Jay
I guess on Westside Story he thought I spit in his face
Told Ed Lover & Moni Love I was talkin' to Ja
With that Maybach line, it was payback time
Keep fuckin' with me nigga, I'll put you under me
Take your car and trade it in for eight 3 hundred C's
If you cross my T, I'll dot your eyes
You'll do life in a cemetery, I'll do mine with Shyne
Come home sit in the throne with my legs crossed
And my Air Forces, middle finger up, fuck the world
'Cause I'm feelin' like Puff when Life After Death hit
Mo' money, mo' problems and I lost my best friend
I'm the second dopest nigga from Compton you'll ever hear
The first nigga only put out albums every 7 years
(You know what speaking of Jay
That just makes me roll down
Now your song Westside Story)
Uh Oh
(You got a line that says
"I don't do button up shirts
Or drive Maybachs"
Is that a shot at Jay?)
Nah, I was talkin' about Ja Rule
Yeah, so, I mean, I just-I-I got a lot of respect for Jay
You know what I'm sayin'?
I never take shots at legends
I just-that's just somethin' I don't do

Let me tell you why I do this shit
I'm a son of a gun 'cause moms was a Hoover Crip
First day I got signed, I had to prove I spit
Freestyle with Busta Rhymes (Busta: son, duke is sick)
The protégé of Doc Dre, I could finally put the shoes on
Now that the rumors of Rakim and Cube gone
They say truth hurts, sunk like quicksand
Don't stop me in traffic and ask about Hittman
I gotta restore the feelin' that crawled from under the rock
After Tha Dogg Pound crushed the buildings
I got a family to feed, I'm the middle of 9 children
We can talk about a loan after I sell 5 million
If I tell you I ain't Game and I don't know Dre
You goin' do me like Xzibit and cut half my face?
I take all the credit for puttin' the West back on the map
If you ain't feelin' that, guess I'm Guerrilla Black
I'm Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary
Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary (The Documentary)11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You know I love you like cooked food, I'm a good dude
Let's hit the Roscoe's on Pico, I'm in a hood mood
I'm sittin' here thinkin' 'bout all the things I could do
So what you should do is play your position for Birkin bags
We poppin' tags, her shoe game sick
We drinkin' Ace out of red bottles, true gang shit
Fuck with me and you're famous
Kanye'd my bitch, now she’s away from the nameless
Camera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger
Jesus piece on the plates, yeah my baby an angel
Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into
Who knew we'd grew into, whatever we into
That's too much for your mental, so we snapback that
Game on point like the stripes on my Gucc backpack
My ladybug, yea she cool like that
In them Trues, why you move like that

You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that
Uh, you my lady
And that pussy feel like a haven
We can make babies, let's be creative
She say leave them tricks alone but I’m a skater
I love her like her daddy told her no man would
I got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good
I get her flowers for nothing, she smiling and blushing
If I don't answer my phone, then we probably fucking, and yeah
She love my tattoos
Ain't got no room for her name but I'ma make room
She let her hair down, we have a stare down
She said "I'm glad you ate it," where my cap & gown?
Told her, "I can be your chauffeur", dick like a limo
Multiple orgasms, that’s my M.O., haha
Redbone pretty
I kiss her from her titty to her clitty, Tunechi

You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that
Sean Don, whoa
Look, my girl's sweet like my hotel floor
From where they ran through more keys than a hotel door
The D, give her the D now the whole hotel know
Feel like I'm looking down from Heaven
Screaming, "Oh, Hell no!"
When you hop on top, girl, that's what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain't feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed, that's just real life (shit)
Cause it's hard when you ain't on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wade but we ain't on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me 'bout her ex man, her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories
Don't fuck her on her period, ain't into horror stories
I take her to my favorite restaurant, she order for me
'Cause she know me

You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that
It make sense right, yeah
Girl look, I'm feeling your style
I'm loving your swag
I like how your jeans fit
You're killing that bag
You working them heels
Your diamonds are real
You give me the chills, girl
You're all that...14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

This that sick rap, kick back, come to where I pitch at
Where bitches love The Game like Tyson Beckford six pack
Presidential Rollie, nigga, where your wrist at?
I can kill you in four bars, that's a Kit Kat
Did the Lambo my way with a sick wrap
Smooth as Frank Sinatra with a motherfucking slick back
No rats in my pack, ain't no wrinkles in my slacks
Counting singles in my Shaqs, stacking Pringles from the crack
Nigga I was on the bus with it
Had 12 stuck to my chest in the field with the colt
Andrew Luck with it
We had the rock, hit the block like what's up with it
Jay was in the Z, my young gunnas in the truck with it
Sigel would've loved it, Philly would've fucked with it
California state property you niggas stuck with it
Brrrring, sold Peedi Crakk
Game was on the block in his beanie with a Mac
I'm what you rap niggas 'fraid of
A Compton nigga that could go bar for bar with Jada
Let me tell you who suck, like banana Now or Laters
Blac Chyna head the bomb, al-Qaeda
Listen, you want beef I'll cater
Game snap on everything he like a fucking wild gator
Silver and black Ghost, nigga that's Al Davis
Give me Left Eye back, take Fetty Wap and the Raiders
The Rams is back, them bullets getting tossed
16 on your back like you fucking Jeff Goff
Your man acting girly too put 30 on his chest
Kanye shrug bitch, welcome to the west
YG, Nipsey, and Kendrick yea check
Shout 'em out I just do it like a fucking Nike rep
Bentley truck Chuck, with the Henny cupped up
Don't get me fucked up, you see the semi tucked, duck
Pass the Goose, where them duck ducks?
These hoes foaming at the mouth, they got Penny fucked up
I'm 'bout to poke 'em like a cactus
Told that bitch to roll the Philly for the game, and she talking about practice
The Maybach is A.I
Artificial intelligence motherfucker that's Junior Seau
All my doors suicide, I'm in Vegas shoot the five
Tell the dealer pay me don't be shy he ain't from Do or Die
Now do you wanna ride, back seat of my Caddy?
Used to flip them pies ain't no relation to Patti
And I move Ps, ain't no relation to Swaggy
Before that it was missing teeth and nickel sack baggies
That's caine, no daddy cause I ain't really have one
And you can't call yourself dope if you ain't never bag none
I'm the old DMX you niggas Drag-On
Game raw as fuck like poking holes in the Magnum
Used to ether the niggas in all of my 16s
Now I scare 'em once a year like I'm fucking Halloween
This ain't a dream, nigga hurricane a nightmare
Stab you in your sleep and smack your baby out his highchair
Your daddy was a bitch, I had to do it
I ain't need no ski mask to do it
Murder is Rihanna and I'm attracted to it
Name a state, I'll send a package through it
If the fed hack into it, they get bossed on like I'm Massachusetts Huh!
Sitting in this Maybach with music
Your head is like Mustard beat and I'll put the ratchet to it
PARTY sent my jackas to it
Drama bring the Mac into it
And this scope will get your mouth washed when I attach it to it
Gold on my neck, I make your bitch put her back into it
Usain Bolt if you bring a real track into it
Another classic moving the way to Aftermath to do it
Dre had the Chronic all I did was put the matches to it
Traffic moving backwards through it
Ever since I had the Buick
Known for putting cheese on niggas heads the way the Packers do it
And I had the yay, yea I brought crack to music
Every situation in rap, I've been a savage through it
And all these hoes getting mad cause I'm smashing through 'em
They can get a ring one day, if the Cavs can do it
Be LeBron bitch, I'm Jayceon bitch
Who else you seen parked at the swap meet in James Bond shit?
Another foreign car driven by a convict
Aventador matte black Akon lips
Nas ether niggas, Game napalm shit
Niggas say my name I pop up like the State Farm bitch
No nigga can see me, on or off TV
Gum bottom Yeezys, I'm the 6' 5" Eazy
Lightskin bitches be mad and talking greasy
I'ma start fucking them Dej Loafs and Dreezy's
I'ma start beefing with Cole, Drizzy and Cornrow Kenny
Or you could pick your favorite rapper, and he gon' be pouring out Henny
I got a bitch from Minne-Apolis pack a semi
Bang the ratchet at Denny's and fly herself back to Philly
She got a couple mill and she don't even know Meek
And ever since that nigga snitched on me we just don't speak
See that shit you got with Drake is like a slow leak
Blood'll be dripping like Niagara if I poke Meek
Nicki won't get no sleep, I'm coming through at 4 a.m
Four deep, to leave his dead body on the soaked sheets
It could happen lowkey
You better have Ross call me or you gon' be eye level with a roach feet
This ain't a diss, nigga
This is all lives matter except this nigga's
This 1992 shit ain't no new shit
We in that all black you won't know who Blood and who Crip
With guns big enough to sink a fucking cruise ship
Fuck around and be a news clip with them loose lips
My nigga Drizzy packed you out and you ain't do shit
This the Golden State and my shooters ain't on no hoop shit
Nigga, you know that I'll snap you like a toothpick
And snitching on niggas ain't never been no cool shit
And I've been wanting to give Nicki this pool stick
So tell your lil' vivrant thing come fuck with Q-Tip
We know where you live, nigga, you better move quick
And start thinking twice about who you hop in the coupe with21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I don't read the XXL
Tote a .45 at the church, think I'm destined for hell, oh well
Blood tears off the face of my Jesus Piece
It's bloodshed, feel the cracks in my city streets
I'm from the crack of them city streets
Used to sell crack in them city streets, born in Blood, nigga
In a coma five days, life of a thug nigga
Momma ain't show, grandma almost pulled the plug nigga
Used to pull the gun out, just because of cuz niggas
Five shots to the head 'cause I'm a Blood nigga
Nuttin' brewing but suwoo'ing where the fuck I'm from
You lucky if you make it out of Compton, ask Andre Young
Smell the scent of dead bodies ridin' down Green Leaf
No peace so don't get caught up with no piece
Fuck Fatburger, we cooking that real beef
Mommas mourning they sons, I'm talking real grief
Real funerals of them lost Juveniles
Trying to be generals, be missing your dinner now, huh
Say its a blessing when you die in ya sleep
'Cause the coroner don't need no sheets, capisce?
I'm sayin', stop playing, wrap him up in what he lay in
Fold a nigga arms, now a casket what he pray in
Compton streets raised me
Can't tell my grandma nothing 'bout her baby, you crazy
I said she see no evil, she don't hear nothing at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'ma see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then? What happened then?

I live this life at a pace that anyone can go
Know your place and dedicate your role, to the faith that you'll die alone
Trace your steps when I do step in a fire of broken bones
And I require my heart's desire and when I reap what I sow
I bought my momma a Benz, my boobie a Jag
A car for my dogs, with a roof full of glass
But still I be feeling like none of my light never casts
Out of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast
But fuck that, I'm not worried, even when it's scary
Skrrt off makin' them hurt off I should have hurt them in a hurry
Dirt off all under my fingers, dirt all of 'em gon is gone is burried
Shirt off when precedure, resuscitation came early
I need you to keep quiet as a mouse
Which is ironic 'cause rats is what I'm talking about
I'm hearin the sonics of gun fire
The whispers, the silent cries
Even though I know it's an eye for an eye
I said she see no evil, she don't hear nothing at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'mma see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then? What happened then?

I was born a soldier, ride or die for mine
Tattooed tears and a lawyer, tried to give me life
Heaven can you hear me? 'Cause I know that hell can
So heaven can you heal me? I'm only just a man, oh

You want to go to Compton? Nigga I'll take you there
Hub City bodies get burnt butt-naked here
Respect the code, a nigga's calling from the pen
Colombian neck-ties on the outside from within
And then, your momma never see you again
Casket to never wake up plastered in MAC make-up, huh
Niggas can’t hear you talking from the sky
And only five year olds see your ghost when you die, no lie
Karma catches up to all you head honchos
2 dome shots in that head, Griselda Blanco
Shit get real though inside the Foxhills though
Nigga living that fast life and get killed slow
Ask Wack and Draws if a nigga run the streets
My grandmother’s prayers saved you niggas I never wanted peace
Los Angeles, I’m the motherfucking King here
No first 48 'cause muh'fuckers don’t sing here, huh
I said she see no evil, she don't hear nothing at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'ma see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then? What happened then?28EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

All rats gotta die though
In New York, Quad Studios, gettin' high though
Off that sour diesel and that hydro
This nigga take an L every time he go viral
Welcome to the West, and this ain't The Life of Pablo
Stay on that bullshit it's gon' start to feel like Chicago
Keep it one hunnid, you Nicki Minaj sideshow
Still chasin' dreams, I made "Dreams" in '05 though
Ridin' around, 10 Cam Newtons in the Tahoe
And when we touch down everybody catchin' spirals
Dressed in all black like the Panthers
We seen your Sway freestyle, Omelly ain't the answer

You ain't got the answers, man! You ain't got the answers! (Kanye…) You ain't got the answers! You ain't got the answers, Sway! I've been doin' this more than you!
Niggas ain't got the answers for me
You shoulda went and got A.I., left Beans in rehab

Yeah, take Beans back to rehab
On Instagram lookin' like a mothafuckin' bean bag
Flyin' through Philly on them Wocky sticks
Punk-ass nigga, I'll beat you with a hockey stick
The nigga Hov gave you the game, you ain't soak it
You was s'posed to throw up the Roc, not smoke it
Talkin' you gon' be in L.A. in three hours
It's a 5-hour flight, put this bum in the shower
Pussy, I'm not a rookie, akhi, don't push me
Strapped, Ninja Turtles, nigga's runnin' with a rat
Now Tak tell 'em how you coppin' pleas on the jack
Fuck runnin' in the game, you gon' be runnin' into Wack
You jumped Quentin Miller and now you don't scrap
It was time to go at Drizzy and now you don't rap
Ask your bitch, she know I beez in the trap
You gotta move out of L.A., I'll put them Bs on your back
And Barbie keep her thumb in your butt
That Ken doll love gettin' fucked
Hide behind your niggas, you ain't got the guts
Ridin' dirt bikes with your ass on some nuts
Now you can pop a wheelie to that!
I went from B-more to New York to Philly and back
It's a lot of cheese at stake, this nigga really a rat
I fuck with Philly, but this nigga make y'all city look wack
And that's on Piru, yeah, I put the P on that hat
You get hit with the Eagle, roll a Philly to that
Now tell the world how you got your bitch
You FaceTimed Nicki while Safaree was fuckin' a chick
You ain't shit but a rat to me, a snake that don't rattle me
Lil' homie won't scrap with me, time to body his faculty
I'm in traffic, B, bumpin' this old Cassidy
Meesha's another casualty, fuckin' with me's a tragedy
The louder your scream, the wacker the verse
I put that dick chaser logo on the back of your hearse
They say the meek shall inherit the Earth
So I went and dug your ass up, 'cause Drizzy buried you first
And why you tryna pick on Wale?
You told me that you don't fuck with Rozay
And YG can't give you a pass
I add 20 to your 40s, put the 60s on your ass
And don't try to whine to the Grapes
You not the Rams, don't come back to L.A
I fuck around and catch an Uber to Slay
I'm a drama king, and a street sweeper with a K
Nigga, this is 2Pac mixed with the old Guwop
15 years, 30 mil', nigga, who flopped?
One good song, but you ain't got a classic yet
Bought your first album, ain't took it out the plastic yet
Move from Philly to L.A. and think he Fresh Prince
Sean Kingston got robbed and now you niggas best friends
Fat sloppy Twinkie eatin' ass nigga
You ain't got no pass, nigga, I'ma beat your ass, nigga
Jelly bean smugglin' fuck-ass nigga
I'll get some clippers and cut your mama's mustache, nigga
Fuck your sister while you watch 'cause she's kinda thick
And make that bitch take a knee, like Colin Kaepernick
Now back to Squeak Milly, Meeky Mouse
You gon' fuck around, get tied up inside Nicki house
I got esés on Beaumont, posted like Cousins
Waiting for the word to pump it up, like Joe Buddens
Thou shall not fuck with Chuck, pawns are stuck
Fold you up in boxes; Armani tux
Louie sweats, armor tucked
Night night, use that pillow like a silencer, from dawn to dusk
Get at me, you niggas gon' see me in gloves
Or see me in clubs with "Summer Sixteen" in the snub
Lying on the Internet like you ain't talking to twelve
Got the cops at my door, like they dropping off mail
I seen that fake paperwork on XXL
Rat niggas chew through walls and leave you in cells
Before you see me in jail, you will see me in hell
You went and got the whole Philly, it's just me by myself
I could have went and got Kendrick, went and got Snoop
Went and got Nipsey, Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q
Could have went and got E-40, brought Ice Cube back
And have Dr. Dre screaming "Meek Mill is a rat"
It's a wrap, red khakis, red Cincinnati
I'ma see you in the streets, don't at me
You like a boat with a hole you can't sail
Meek Mill, me and Drake gave you them two Ls
(Ooouuu, Ooouuu, Ooouuu)
When these rats start snitching, break 'em off!
(Ooouuu, Ooouuu, Ooouuu)
When these rats start snitching, break 'em off!
Pussy nigga! (Mumbles)
I got on gold headphones, gold chain
Gold on my wrist, aim (Mumbles)
If you ain't getting money, boy, you lame
You rat bastard!34EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Tell 'em pray for me
It was God that brought Dre to me
Even brought the nigga Kanye for me
Bless - but them niggas shot Big
Made a nigga feel ashamed of the the city where he live
Make a nigga hate the logo on the Dodger cap
Thinking back to that Bimmer, wish my nigga Pac was strapped
But I'm dreaming Las Vegas Boulevard, Afeni's son's bullet scars
Everybody king of Diamonds until the feds pull they cards
Not the deck though
Hip-hop was better off when it was just Dre, Scarface, and Esco
Memoirs of the gold chain
It's a cold game nigga, Johnny Coltrane
Black Versaces with the gold frame
Nigga said he sold 'caine that's a bold claim
14 had a brain that could throw flames
So strange, have to blow they mind, Cobain

Mama forgive me cause I'm tryna make a living, hah
Them niggas hatin' cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah
Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Lord willin', I see a billion
'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
That's the crack music, nigga
Never spit a verse cause I was making trap music, nigga
I'm not an army, I'm a movement
The flow is water, Andre tried to Ice Cube him
Ice Cubin', roof translucent
Chick on my side tryna get my Trues loose
When I'm talkin' 'bout God, she 'posed to bow her head
Now she all on the blog, steady postin' 'bout her head
Got me thinking like a father, is the world safe?
Got me clinging to my daughter like shark fins in water
Rocks in my ears sunk the Titanic
This is my life and it's exactly how I planned it, damn it
God says everything happens for a reason
I seen four seasons at The Four Seasons
Take that chinchilla off, poor kids is freezing
Cookin' up in the same pot they ain't got to pee in

Mama forgive me cause I'm tryna make a living, hah
Them niggas hatin' cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah
Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Lord willin', I see a billion
'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Pieces on gold leashes
Cruisers, around greases make them cohesive
I'm the sun shining with God features
Draw closer to a true blood bleeder, soul of a southern preacher
Went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders
We throw the peace up, knowing that the world need us
Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights
To sacrifices we made it's sorta Christ-like
At the after party thinking what the afterlife's like
He paid for our sins, is it really priced right?
Fuck it, I see the light, broads, they see the light
Can't deny my Jesus piece that’s so Peter-like
Chicks crow for dough, get low for mo'
A convo piece, she end up at the condo
Another Jane Doe or a golden angel
Pendant on an angle, watch the chain glow

Mama forgive me cause I'm tryna make a living, hah
Them niggas hatin' cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah
Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Lord willin', I see a billion
'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Peace to my man Tune for giving his man room
Now we hittin’ switches 'til the Spring Break, Cancun
Get it? Nah forget it, Soo Woo I live it
Made the letter B more famous than a Red Sox fitted
But that was suicide, I don’t live in Judas’ eyes
Half of these rappers weren’t trappin’ when I was choppin’ the do or die
Suge had me in, I went Puffy like Zab Judah eye
Dre called, told my baby momma “won’t you decide”
She chose Doc, first day I pulled dude a side
Like it's Aftermath for life and all I do is ride
Before I turn on ‘em I kill Satan

Ferrari got an ice cream paint job, Dorrough
I’m up out the hood, where they pull guns on you like
Come up out ya hood, it ain't never all good
We roll up in backwoods, nigga get to actin’ stupid
Get thrown in the backwoods, Los Angeles
Home of the scandalous, pimp, hoes and gamblers
98 degrees on Christmas, nigga we rollin’ cannabis
Swisha sweet ain't it, I told her I’m Charles Louboutin
The bitch fainted, pulled her panties down, stain it
That’s my Chi-lingo, yeah I’m bi-lingual
Ball by myself, nigga, Ochocinco
Dancing with the stars, bullets and fast cars
And everybody bleed out here, word to God

Last train to Paris, round the world in these red Nikes
Che Guevara of the New Era, test me
Louisville slugger, Yogi Berra in my new era
Got that natty on, tighter than a magnum
Walk in the club saggin’ with a .38 Magnum
Red Ralph Laurens, the double R sittin’
On a hill like Lauren her and the car foreign
Got my red Dre Beats on, tryna put my peeps on
And I keep it hood like this Phantom is a Nissan
Where my nigga Jim Jones at? Roll up the weed son
So many bloods in Compton had to get a NYC song
And while I’m out here, I might as well go shopping
And put this new bad bitch I got in some red bottoms
And all these hatin’ ass niggas want me dead
Cause I’m Malcolm X before he turned Muslim, Red
