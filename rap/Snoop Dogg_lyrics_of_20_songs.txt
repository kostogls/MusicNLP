(Ugh) Ha-ha-ha, I'm serious, nigga
One of y'all niggas got some bad motherfuckin' breath
(Oh, man) Aye, baby, aye, baby, (shit) aye, baby
Get some bubblegum in this motherfucker or somethin'
Aye, nigga, get somethin' to eat, dog
Aye, nigga, study long, study wrong, nigga

With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's
And make a few ends as I breeze through?
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
‘Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do?
Shit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what?) we don't love them hoes, yeah
So we gon' smoke an ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, ‘cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze beyotch, I'm just…
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke; shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
‘Cause when I bust my nut I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you, hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be...

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, beyotch
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, beyotch
With my mind on my money

You're back now at the jack-off hour
This is DJ EZ Dicc
On WBALLZ
Right now, something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys
A big bow-wow-wow
'Cause we gonna make it a little misty here tonight
This is DJ EZ Dicc
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass with a fat dick
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you, lady
But now, I take it all back
'Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise, baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny
You can come on over
And I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day, baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
'Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world
Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch, I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin' Indo to smoke
I gets loc'ed and loony, bitch, you can't do me
Do we look like BBD? You hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in Tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed to pay this hoe just to lay this hoe?
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple mo' times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothin' else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
'Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention?
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt, ho, you'll never be my only one, trick-ass bitch!

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

Guess who's back in the motherfuckin' house?
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
'Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin' damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now, as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop?
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
'Cause you know I don't love 'em
Woo! Hey, now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '64—red, to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm strugglin'
Just get on your knees and then start jugglin'
These motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G, the nigga with the clout

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none48EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

("Indo Smoke" Plays in Background)
Aye, aye,  JC
'Sup Enron
Ain't that Snoop Dogg over there?
That nigga with that blue coat on?
Yeah
Yeah, oh yeah, that's that nigga
Nigga roll up on the side of him, man
Roll your window down
Man, hand me my motherfucking Glock man, give me another clip
Cause I'm gonna smoke this fool
Yeah roll the windows down
Yeah, okay there you go
Aye man, you Snoop Dogg?
Snoop, Snoop Doggy Dogg?
Man he's Snoop Dogg
Man fuck that nigga (Gun Shots)
Nigga man
Get that nigga man
Man get up fool man, get up man, don't be trying to run man
Get up on that fool man, I don't give a fuck
What set you got now?
Fuck you nigga
Yeah nigga, what's up?
Nigga
Yeah mothafucka
Yeah nigga, one less nigga
Yeah nigga, you's a dead motherfucker now
As I look up at the sky
My mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they break in tryna save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn, I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die, my boo boo's 'bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live? (Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son) my eyes are closed

Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
(Just remember who changed your mind
'Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
'Cause my eyes wanna journey some mo', really doe (check it out)
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
'Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
'Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma, I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Yeah, gotta say what's up to my nigga Slick Rick
For those who don't like it, eat a dick
But for those who with me, sing that shit
As it go a little something like this

Lodi Dodi, we likes to party
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody
We're just some niggas who're on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic, we rock the mic (right)
For all my Doggs keepin' y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
'Cause it's cool when you cause the cozy condition in
Which we create, cause that's our mission
So listen close, to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day
I woke up around 10 o'clock in the morning
I gave myself a stretch, up, a morning yawn, and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said "Um, mirror mirror, on, the wall
Who is the top dog of them all?"
There was a ruffle duffle, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, "You are, you conceited bastard!"
Well that's true! That's why we never have no beef
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay 'cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson's Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne
Now I'm fresh, dressed like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks, with my all-blue Chucks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, "oh no"
I went back in, "I forgot my Indo!"
Then I dilly (dally) I ran through a (alley)
I bumped into this smoker named (Sally) from the (Valley)
This was a girl playing hard to get
So I said "What's wrong?" 'cause she looked upset
She said, um:
It's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so, how much you'll never know
'Cause you took your dope away from me

Damn, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me and she was feelin blue
I said, "Um, don't cry, dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys"
Her mean mother steps then says to me "Hi!"
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Something was wrong I said, "What was goin on?"
I tried to break it up, I said, "Stop it, just leave her!"
She said, "If I can't smoke none, she can't either!"
She grabbed me closely by my socks
And so I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
They started crying on my shoes and grabbin' my dick
And saying "Why don't you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
I'll give you all my love today
Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see?
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay"
And on and on and on she kept goin'
The bitch been around before my mother's born!
I said "Cheer up!" and I gave her a hit
I said, "You can't have me, I'm too young for you bitch!"
She said, "No you're not!" then she starts cryin'
I says I'm 19, she says, "Stop lyin!"
I says, "I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover"

Yeah, uh, tick-tock ya don’t stop
And to the, uh, tick-tock n'ya don’t quit
Yeah, n'ya tick-tock ya don’t stop
And to the, uh, tick-tock n'ya don’t quit

Man, don't you know that I'm loco?
Mhm, hm

I was chillin' (Chillin') right around my way (Way)
21st, east side of the Beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
Talkin' shit with his homies like he was a straight G
Askin' where I'm from while he runnin' up
Gangbang my set on e'ry one of 'em (20's, nigga, 20's)
Some things, sons, they just won't change
Fools don't respect nuttin' but the gangbang (Bang)
What's seen is what's saw, Dogg is the law
I have you niggas runnin' like a marathon
Lil' G's tryna creep on the East with it
Talkin' 'bout they gon' get my chain and they gon' leave with it (Mm)
But they don't know once they get close
It's tic-tac-toe, three motherfuckers laid on the floor (Watch out)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray, I heard a ese say, he said

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers, say, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (Uh-huh)
They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged
(Blaow) Run nigga, run nigga
(Blaow) Duck nigga, duck nigga

(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run nigga, run nigga
(Blaow) Duck nigga, duck nigga

I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now there's three motherfuckers dead and I ain't seen shit
But these niggas'll scream for plea
But for a G like me, it's just a case, really, you could see
I crack the MAC back and pop off rollin'
And smack ya neck back, ya drop off, fallin'
I haven't seen my mama in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me
Fuck that, I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl, you would think that they were broads
Believin' all the things that you never saw
In it, y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a Menthol
You think you know? But this can't go
You think you'll blow on my dope? What the fuck? No
See these niggas proceed with speed
So feel the need to bleed, all you hear my enemies goin'
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers, say, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (Uh-huh)
They keep talkin' and it went too far

(Blaow) Run nigga, run nigga
(Blaow) Duck nigga, duck nigga
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run

I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
If I didn't pop niggas in they mouth, goddamn
And Snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets, run with them niggas with the heat (Heat)
You never seen a thug like this
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
In fact, I could be "Beast of the East", motherfucker
I never hesitate to blaze (Blaze)
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team, 'cause my peoples
Is screamin' that we need more for fun or it's illegal
Ba-ba-bang on a song, make it feel like a drive-by (Drive-by)
It's a shame, but somebody gotta die (Die)
They see it happen state-to-state
But when I'm mobbin' L.A., all I hear the eses say, they go
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers, say, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (Uh-huh)

Don't fool with the player with the cool whip
Yeah, yeah, you know I'm always on that cool shit
Walk to it, do it how you do it
Have a glass, let me put you in the mood, and
Little cutie, looking like a student
Long hair with your big fat booty
Back in the days, you was a girl I went to school with
Had to tell your moms and sister to cool it
The girl wanna do it, I just might do it
Hit her up with some pimp-pimp fluid
Mommy, don't worry, I won't abuse it
Hurry up and finish so we can watch Clueless
I laugh at these niggas when they ask, "Who do this?"
But everybody know, ooh, girl, that you is
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl

Beautiful, I just want you to know

When I see my baby boo, shit, I get foolish
Smack a nigga that tries to pursue it
Homeboy, she taken, just move it
I asked you nicely, don't make the Dogg lose it
We just blow dro and keep the flow movin'
In a '64, me and baby boo cruisin'
Body rag interior blue, and
Have them hydraulics squeakin' when we screwin'
Now she's yellin', hollerin' out "Snoop!" and
Hootin', hollerin'; hollerin', hootin'
Black and beautiful, you the one I'm choosin'
Hair long, thin, black and curly like you're Cuban
Keep groovin', that's what we doin'
And we gon' be together until your moms move in

You got my pictures on the wall in your room, and
Girls be complaining you keep me boomin'
But girls like that wanna listen to Pat Boone
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
You's a college girl, but that don't stop you from doin'
Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you, and
You don't ask why I roll with a crew, and
Twist up my fingers, and wear dark blue, and
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
On the Eastside, that's the crew I choose
Nothing I do is new to you
I smack up the world if they rude to you
'Cause baby girl, you're so beautiful
Beautiful, I just want you to know

Poppin', stoppin', hoppin' like a rabbit
When I take the Nina Ross, ya know I gots to have it
I lay back in the cut, retain myself
Think about the shit, and I'm thinkin' wealth
How can I makes my grip
And how should I make that nigga straight slip
Set trip, gotta get him for his grip
As I dip around the corner, now I'm on another
Mission, wishin', upon a star
Snoop Doggy Dogg with the caviar
In the back of the limo, no demo, this is the real
Breakin' niggas down like Evander Holyfield, chill
'Til the next episode
I make money, and I really don't love hoes
Tell you the truth, I swoop in the Coupe
I used to sell loot, I used to shoot hoops
But now I make hits every single day
With that nigga, the diggy Dr. Dre
So lay back in the cut motherfucker 'fore you get shot
It's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop

Boy it's gettin' hot, yes indeed it is
Snoop Dogg is on the mic, I'm 'bout as crazy as Biz
Markie, spark the chronic bud real quick
And let me get into some fly gangsta shit
Yeah, I lay back, stay back in the cut
Niggas try to play the D-O-G like a mutt
I got a little message, don't try to see Snoop
I'm finna fuck a bitch, what's her name? It's Luke
You tried to see me on the TV, you'se a B.G
D-O-double-G, yes I'm a O.G
You can't see my homie Dr. Dre
So what the fuck a nigga like you gotta say?
Gotta take a trip to the MIA
And serve your ass with a motherfuckin' AK
You can't see the D-O-double-G, 'cause that be me
I'm servin' 'em, swervin' in the Coupe
The Lexus flexes from Long Beach to Texas
Sexist hoes, they wanna get with this
'Cause Snoop Dogg is the shit, biatch!
Ahhhh, I'm somewhat brain boggled
So I look to the microphone and slowly start to wobble
Grab it, habit, stick it to the plug
It's Snoop Doggy, I got a got a fat dub
Sack of the chronic in my back pocket loc
Need myself a lighter so I can take a smoke
I toke everyday, I loc everyday
With the P-O-U-N-D and my nigga Dr. Dre
Lay back in the cut like I told your ass
Gimme the microphone and let me hit you with a blast
I got a little cousin by the name of Daz
And bitches who fuck him gimme the ass
'Cause they know about the shit that we be goin' through
And they know about the shit that I be puttin' up
And they be knowin' bout the shit I do when I'm on the mic
'Cause Snoop Dogg is Trump tight like a virgin, the surgeon
Is Dr. Drizzay, so lizzay, and plizzay
With D-O-double-Gizzay the fly human being seein'
No, I'm not European bein' all I can
When I put the motherfuckin' mic in my hand, and
You don't understand what I'm kickin'
'Cause Snoop is on the mic and I gets wicked, follow me
Listen to me, 'cause I do you like you wanna be done
Snoop Doggy Dogg on this three two one, umm
Dum, diddy-dum here I come
With the gat, and the guitar will strum, I'm
Not that lunatic nigga who you thought I was
When I caught you slippin', I'ma catch you then I'll peel your cap
Snap back, relax
Ya bet' not be slippin' with them D's on that '83 Cadillac
So we gon' smoke an ounce to this

Dressed in all black, but his hat says Steeler (Steeler, Steeler)
Pedal to the metal (Metal)
I gotta go hard, drive by and say "hello"
Hey, Fredwreck, you my mello
Now let me hear what I sound like acapella (Shh)
Wow, ride, dip swish
Now bring it back, just like this

The homie dog in a Jag and he's checkin' for the checkered flagin'
Comin' in first, never in last
'Cause my car too fast (Zoom, zoom)
I never ever run outta gas
'Cause I'm just too clean, I do it upperclass
So fasten your seat belts
It's so hot, it will even make heat melt (Woo, woo)
So get a bowl and roll and ride
Slip through the slip and slide
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm

Let your children play
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die
Killer on the road

Need for Speed, I'm tryin' to take the lead
Hold on, little homie, 'fore you run into the trees (Watch out!, watch out!)

Yeah, that's right, I like that
The royal penis is clean your highness
Thank you, uh, uh
Snoop, Kells
You know how we get down

I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (hey) your boy Kells (hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

Let's get this party jumpin', me and Kel' gon' get it bumpin'
They humpin' like when it's over, we gon' all get into somethin'
The Dogg is fresh, Southside without a vest
Nothin on my chest but these ladies up out the Midwest
I must confess that in the Chi you're so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test, you fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago, let me get you to this real west
It's real strong, real fat and real long
Doggies in the building, holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone
Get that home grown, put that shit on Daddy long
I know how you ladies do it, t-shirt with no panties on
Let's get this shit crackin', Kell and Doggy Dogg in action
If you in here all alone, you might get this dog bone
I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (hey), your boy Kells (hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

Dippin' low, '64, hundred spokes and chronic smoke
All these ladies on the floor cause they know what we in here for
Dogg and Kelly came to ball, get your ass up off the wall
Let that middle wiggle now make that shit fall
Not just one but all y'all, move it like you want it all
Let me see you bounce it for me, work that shit for Doggy Dogg
You gots to do it, is that your crew?
Bring 'em too, come here let me take you through it
Then once Kelly get into it, we can get this after party
Poppin' everybody, got themselves another body
Knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot
Hold up, I came to cool out, lay back and get blown
Maybe Henny, maybe gin, a couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it but now it's known
That this that shit, Kels sing that song, come on
I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (hey) your boy Kells (hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

So if you think you got the bomb shit
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa

Can we get a motherfuckin' moment of silence
For the small chronic break?
A-hah, niggas be brown-nosin' these hoes and shit
Takin' bitches out to eat, and spendin' money on these hoes
Know what I'm sayin'?
I treat a bitch like 7-Up — I never have, I never will
I tell a bitch like this:
"Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without Bluenotes
You'll never go platinum!"
Hey Daz, give me a light, nigga
We’d like to welcome y'all to the fabulous Carolina West
I own this motherfucker, and my name is Taa-Dow
Y'all niggas know who I am, y'all niggas tearin' up shit
But we got somethin' old, and somethin' new for y'all tonight
Put yo' hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics

It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go
I'm hearin' motherfuckers tryin' to steal my flow
But it ain't no thang, 'cause, see, my nigga Coolio
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the do'
You know, some of these niggas is so deceptive
Usin' my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt, seems you haven't learnt
It's the knick-knack, paddywhack, I still got the biggest sack
So put your gun away, run away, 'cause I'm back (Whyyy?)
Hit 'em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
Now, tell me, what's going on?
It make me wanna holler, 'cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for the break up, so take off your clothes
And quit tryin' to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes
Speakin' of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb 'cause I rolled you a joint?
You'se a flea! And I'm the Big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws
Y'alls niggas better recognize (Uh-huh)
And see where I'm comin' from — it's still Eastside 'til I die
Why ask why?
As the world keeps spinnin' to the D-O-double G, Y

It's a crazy, mixed-up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World

Well, if you give me ten bitches, then I'll fuck all ten
See my homie Snoop Dogg sippin' juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm for the set-trip to get papers
Styles vary, packin' flavor like Lifesavers
Ain't that somethin'? Talk shit and I'm dumpin'
I had your whole fuckin' block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the technique, I'm unique like China
You'll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm comin' through
One-two, three — you can't see me
I'm a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics
A fuckin' menace, usin' hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and poppin'
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
I wanna see some panties droppin'
I'm comin' from L.A, she used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that ho
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I’m dishin' out blues, I’m upsettin' like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name’s often marked for catchin' slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it’s unexplanatory how I gets wicked
But it’s mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I’m runnin' hoes in '94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'
Prepare for a war, it’s on
I’m head huntin', hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murderin' with rhymes packin' TEC-9’s for some action
You really don’t know, do you? You fuckin' wit a hog
You can’t do me, I’m goin' out looney like O-Dog
It's a crazy, mixed-up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World

Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (All night long)
Uh-huh, 'til when? (Till the early morn')
It don't stop, and uh... it don't quit for the...
Tha Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavi dope shit

Diggity-Daz out of the motherfuckin' cut once mo'
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip-flop and serve hoes with the fat dick
'Til I die, I'm still screamin' out ("Bitches ain't shit!")
Now, I'm the mack daddy, had he
Not known about the city where I'm from, dum-diddy-dum
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D, the gangster clique
Now as Tha Pound break it down with the gangster funk
I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want
So I blaze up the chronic so I can get high
I promise I'll smoke chronic 'til the day that I die

It's a Doggy Dogg World8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Believe me, I never bite the hand that feed me
Just point them niggas out
And I'll leave 'em all on the street bleeding
Bitch, you fucking with a grown man
How I be done waxed you in your house
And then buried you on your own land
See, the cops is scared to come and get me
But I don't blame 'em cause they know
I got a bunch of dog niggas with me
Looking for trouble, starting shit
I'm riding solo, and I'm busting and getting rid of your clique
See you boys ain't about beefing
When you fucking with niggas
That'll definitely get you eternal sleep
But if you didn't get the fucking picture, *gunshots*
Bitch, I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I ride for my niggas

She 'bout to go in
She likes that low end
Damn her ass is so big
Just keep it bumpin'
Peaches N Cream
Uh oh there she go
That's that look all on her face
Shorty dancing like she knows
She's the baddest in the place (Hey, hey)
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey)
So what you wanna do?
Got her Freak-Um dress on
Them New Bs on her feet
And them bottles with the sparkles
So the other girls can see that she's paid
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey!)
So what you wanna do?

She too fly for words
And where I'm at now I'm too high for birds
Shorty, what you think about my return
Cuz what he think about it ain't my concern
I ain't come for you, I came for your Missus
I don't do it for the haters, I do it for the players
Well okay, I do it for the riches
But in the meantime and in-between time
Shorty right there gon' get it if she with it
If she ain't, then I know her partner down
Cuz her partner throwing shots every time I turn around
And her partner bringing partners every time I come to town
I'm a G6er, a Maybacher
You can tell the chauffeur he can park it right there
And I'ma walk up to the club upstairs
And when I come down he can bring it back, word
She 'bout to go in
She likes that low end
Damn her ass is so big
Just keep it bumpin'
Peaches N Cream
Uh oh there she go
That's that look all on her face
Shorty dancing like she knows

And them bottles with the sparkles
So the other girls can see that she's paid
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey!)
So what you wanna do?

I came to cut right now
Bigg Snoop Dogg and I came to get down
Yes, I'm internationally known
Libra lovin' make you moan and groan
Burn my gas like race cars
Two bad broads with the bass on
I never met a girl that I'd wait for
I seal my deal like Jay does
All that and then some
Pimp real for real when I win some
I remember what you're thinking
Black shades on, drinking while you're blinking
Something fly, white limousine
Make a clean getaway
I loved your clothes, what you about
The way you let it out
She 'bout to go in
She likes that low end
Damn her ass is so big
Just keep it bumpin'
Peaches N Cream
Uh oh there she go
That's that look all on her face
Shorty dancing like she knows
She's the baddest in the place (Hey, hey)

Them New Bs on her feet
And them bottles with the sparkles
So the other girls can see that she's paid
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey!)
So what you wanna do?

Everybody in the world (Here we go)
Fill your body with the smoke (And that's the way to go)

She 'bout to go in
She likes that low end
Damn her ass is so big
Just keep it bumpin'
Peaches N Cream

That's that look all on her face

Six million ways to die, choose one

It's time to escape, but I don't know where the fuck I'm headed
Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick, now we putting in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt, death becomes all niggas
Anybody killer, you know what the deal is
Nigga, you know what the real is

I see some mark brand niggas on the corner flaggin me down
Sayin, "Yo Daz, what's up with the Pound?
Is that nigga Snoop alright? Ayo what's up with the crew?
Is them niggas in jail, or are them niggas through?"
I said, "If you ain't up on thangs
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the game"
It's like this, they don't understand
It's an everyday thang to gangbang
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggas know
What's up witchu? I represent the Pound and Death Row
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach
And Compton and Watts see D-O-G's
Now, you can't come and you can't run, and you can't
See long to the G of the gang
One gun is all that we need, to put you to rest
(Pump pump!) Put two slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker creeping and sleeping
6 feet deep in, fucking with the Pound is
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide

The cloud becomes black and the sky becomes blue
Now you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew
Ain't no clue on why the fuck we do what we do
Leave you in a state of paranoia, oooh
Don't make a move for your gat so soon
'Cause I drops bombs like Platoon
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
I'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you
I won't leave you until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
Or survival becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open 'cause you don't wanna be caught
Half stepping with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker 'fore you make me
Take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends, you go down with the Devil
Now roam through the depths of Hell
Where the rest your busta-ass homeboys dwell, well
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name?
Serial killa! Serial killa! Serial killa!
(Wake up in the morning, eat your Lucky Charms cereal)

Deep, deep like the mind of Minolta
Now picture this
Let's picnic inside a morgue
Not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets!
And I got the machine to crack your fuckin chest plates
Open and release them guts
Then I release def cuts
Brutal, jagged edged, totally rough-neck!
Now everybody scream, 'nough respect to the X
'Nough respect given
Disrespect and you will not be living
Word to momma, Emma, drama, dilemma

Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name?
Serial killa! Serial killa! Serial killa!
(Wake up in the morning eat your Lucky Charms cereal)13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

How many hoes in your motherfuckin group
Wanna take a ride in my 7-8 Coupe, DeVille
Chill, as I take you on a trip
Where them niggas ride, and slide, you know about the East Side
Niggas like myself, here to show you where it's at
With my hoes on my side, and my strap on my back
Papers I stack daily, and Death Row is still the label that pays me
But you know how that goes
We flow toe for toe, if you ain't on the Row
Fuck you and your ho, really doe, so check it
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg on the solo tip
Still clockin' grip, and don't really give a shiiit
About nuttin' at all, just my Doggs, steppin' through the fog
And I'm still gonna fade em all
With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hangin'
How many hoes in ninety-four will I be bangin'?
Every single one, to get the job done
As I dip, skip, flip, right back to two one
Where the sun be shinin' and I be rhymin'
It's me, Snoop D-O-double-G, and I'm climbin'
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas
This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gz
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas
This is for the hustlas now back to the Gz
I come creepin' through the fog with my saggin' deuce
East Side, Long Beach, in a 7-8 Coupe DeVille
I'm rollin' with the G Funk, bumpin' in my shit and it don't quit
So drop it on the one motherfucker put together that set
A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit
With the Eastside hoes on my motherfuckin' dick
And the Compton niggas all about to set trip
Swing it back, bring it back, just like this
And if you with my shit, then blaze up another spliff
And keep the motherfuckin' blunt in your pocket, loc
'Cause Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke
See it's a West coast thing, where I'm from
And if you want some, get some, bad enough, take some
But watch the gun by my side
Because it represents me and the motherfuckin' East Side
So bow down to the bow wow, 'cause bow wow
Yippie yo, you can't see my flow
My shit is dope, original, now you know
And can't no hood fuck with Death Rizzow
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas
This is for the hustlas, now back to the Gz
This is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlas
This is for the hustlas now back to the Gz--23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck with me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, and I don't see no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign? (Oh)
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone (Ooh wee)
Nigga you ain't no G!
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll, you ain't no G!

It's legit, you know it's a hit
When The Neptunes and the Doggy Dogg fin to spit
You know he's in - tune with the season
Come here baby, tell me why you leaving?
Tell me if it's weed that you need
If you wanna breathe, I got the best weed minus seeds
Ain't nobody tripping, VIP they can't get in
If something go wrong then you know we get to Cripping

I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck with me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, and I don't see no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign?
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone (Oh, oh, yeah!)
Nigga you ain't no G!
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
(Do-do-do-do-do-do) You ain't no G!
Now you stepping with a G, from Los Angeles
Where the helicopters got cameras
Just to get a glimpse of our Chucks
And our Khakis and our bouncing cars
You wit you friend right? (Yeah!)
She ain't trying to bring over no men right? (No!)
Shit, she ain't gotta be in the distance
She could get high all in an instant

I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck with me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, and I don't see no other guys

Mami, mamacita, have you ever flown on G5s
From London to Ibiza? You gotta have cake to
You'll have Sunday's with chiquitas
You'll see Venus and Serena, in the Wimbledon Arena
And I can take you
(Uncle Charlie, preach)
Nigga don't be young and foolish
You don't know what you're doing
You don't know what you've lost until she's gone (til she's gone)
She got a pretty face, drove you wild
But you ain't have that Snoop Doggy Dogg Style

I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck with me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, and I don't see no other guys
