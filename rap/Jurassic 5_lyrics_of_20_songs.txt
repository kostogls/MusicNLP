I work the pen to make the ink transform
On any particular surface the pen lands on
Zaakir is hands on, what's the beef?
The Cooley High Cochise high post techniques
I drape off poetic landscapes and shapes
Illustrate the paper space off the pens that paint
Then design what have a National Geographic a magic
With tailor-made status and plus flavor that's automatic

We're not balling
We take it back to the days of yes y'all-in'
We holding onto what's golden
("On a stage I rage and I'm rollin'")
We're not balling, or shot calling
We take it back to the days of yes y'all-in'
We holding onto what's golden
("On a stage I rage and I'm rollin'")

Melancholy mundane so I tame the hot flame
Big rings, fat chains, and y'all quest for the same
No name, use fame, strictly new to the thang
We stay true to the game and never bring it to shame
We tight like dreadlocks or red fox and ripple
We pass participles, and smash the artist in you
The saga continues, this I won't get into
Cause there ain't enough bars to hold the drama that we been through
Yo...
We still the same with a little fame
A little change in the household name but ain't too much changed
We in the game but, yo not to be vain
I refrain from salt grains to season up my name
We entertain for a mutual game from close range
Steady aim, I drum at your head to hit the brain
I'm labor ready, Rhode Scholar for the dollar
Work for mines pay me by the hour

We're not balling
We take it back to the days of yes y'all-in'
We holding onto what's golden
("On a stage I rage and I'm rollin'")
We're not balling, or shot calling
We take it back to the days of yes y'all-in'
We holding onto what's golden
("On a stage I rage and I'm rollin'")

Hip-Hop music

Yo...
Well, it's the verbal Herman Munster, the word enhancer
Sick of phony mobsters controllin' the dance floor
I'm in them dark places, catch you when you stark naked
Your heart races as we pump you for your chart spaces
The tart tastes be bringing these hot styles through
Some of you bum a few cheers from shock value
Word power can plow through acres of cornfields
Paragraphs cut like warm steel, preform ill...
We're not balling
We take it back to the days of yes y'all-in'
We holding onto what's golden
("On a stage I rage and I'm rollin'")
We're not balling, or shot calling
We take it back to the days of yes y'all-in'
We holding onto what's golden

We were sitting out on a step, you know

Now I'm a say this one time boy and that's my word
We rockin' shots and not fire through the Hindenburg
The contribution is clear
You add water to bone
And get the Jurassic 5 on the microphone
Now if you like the tone
And how the harmony's done
And the sucka MC's die before they've begun
Well I'd like to know if
You've got the notion
'Cause we're number one
I'm not trying to say my style is better than yours
I'm just on some other shit
I'm all about the beats and the lyrics
So when you hear it you can feel it
The vibe is energized by the presence of my spirit
No interference we persevere
The purpose is clear
We're here to leave your ear hurtin' severe
You're lurking in fear
'Cause we take it back like Robin Loxley
Rockin' from country sides to spots where hard rocks be
I often wonder if these MC's even know how it feels
To dedicate they whole life to this mic of steel
It's not about the bills
That's not keeping it real
A lot of tight rappers out here ain't got no deals
We appeal to the brothers with flow finesse
'Cause it's the 100 watt bloodshot Game of Death
'Cause we're protected by the covenant of words and beats
Rewind and feel the heat
Recline and take a seat
So ah...
Let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats from real live mc's
Playground tactics
No rabbit in a hat tricks
Just that classic
Rap shit from Jurassic
Let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats from real live mc's
Playground tactics
No rabbit in a hat tricks
Just that classic
Rap shit from Jurassic

Now I walk from Tanzania
Earthquake Transylvania
And on my way I kicked a hole through the wall of China
Just to get the right blend
'Cause it's schizophrenic of the pathway to livin'
I fell into the deep end
You shouldn't have told me
The pyramids can hold me
So now a contest is what you owe me
Pull out your beats pull out your cuts
Give us a mic, whattup
And we gon' tear shit up
I'm on some old and forgotten
Sun up to sun down
Like picking cotton
The nutty professor science droppin'
Rockin' Robin's hood
From New York to Compton
Me and my three sons
Jabari, Shakir, and Kahsum
Let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats from real live mc's
Playground tactics
No rabbit in a hat tricks
Just that classic
Rap shit from Jurassic
Let's take it back to the concrete streets

Hey, I'm 2na-Fish from U-N-I-T-Y
Do or die
Anti-illuminati, why
Do the liquid from my vocals
Make the ghetto start swimming
Forever winning I'm in it
Like Meadowlark Lemon
I get goosebumps
When the bassline thumps
A sucka MC freestyle
He had mine for lunch
Marc 7even get you open like an attache
Briefcase in this case
The victor is no way
Ah, ah the tool spinners
Cooking the full dinner
Killing the firstborn of lyrical Yul Brynners
When is it the academy
Rattling your anatomy
That'll be J5 so kill all of your fake flattery
That'll be the day
When labels pay our way
2na what you say
When MC's come to play
Man fi dead
'Cause we take it back like Spinal Tap
Preparing your intellect before your final nap
So ah...
Let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats from real live MC's
Playground tactics
No rabbit in a hat tricks
Just that classic
Rap shit from Jurassic

You got beef now watch how I settle it
I'll fuck around and arrest your whole development
I'm eloquent
When it comes to digital display
I'm ready for the world while you earl off the Tanqueray
Tactics, my shits Jurassic 5
Fingers of death while you exhale and inhale
With a deep breath with my Chop-Sui style
'Cause I'm a lyrical chef
I gets mines to the death
'Cause I be cookin'
From here to Brooklyn
Your shit's annoying like fat-ass Bookman
On Good Times
When I rhyme
I hit the designated area
I hope you got your shots 'cause this is lyrical malaria
Spreading, beheading fools with the punishment
I live in America but fuck this government
A hundred and fifty times over silk with lead
While y'all drink the Similac
My rhymes are breast-fed
No artificial nipples
I flip the real skills
I thought I told you once
I kick the lyrical windmills
And backspin Benedict
Strictly for my benefit
I step on toes when I flow don't get offended
Come and get with it
Comprehended when I kick it
I represent the real
From the beginning to the end of it7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yo, my method for my musical madness
Move and motivate those with musical talents, uh
Read it in bold print, we holdin' it down
Liquor shot, hip-hop when we in yo' town
Uhh, master blaster sound
Freak the future far from here and now
With style, release increase the peace, uhh
Bubble with the beat 'til they feelin the heat in the streets
Now each one, teach one, reach one, young gun
On one, listen to the warrior's drum
Beatin' up the block with the ghetto hop that knock
And make you wanna crash the spot
And unlock explode (BOOM) the alpha and omega code
With drum rolls and old soul, we uphold
And foretold to scores of six years ago
Fast flow from G. Rap to Kool Moe
Super syllable, major to the minimal
Every individual, bounce to the tempo yo
Lungs collapse and raps be trapped in
The only way to make it happen, jaw-jappin', fast rappin'

Yo, I'm the hot dog that run the hottest monologue
In star poetic inserts and yes y'alls
My speech is like holding two Glocks apiece
The outreach that rock police
The super adventure men pretend to put somethin' in bitches
Win when we write, the Emmy winner, get hyped off any printer
And I came to get it, hit it
Like Operation PUSH, operate the tush
Black octopus of soul, in inter-planetary patrol
I planted my gold, and low and behold
It's the brother doc, ready to rock-rock
Don't stop Hobbes, I'm hot like the lumberjack chop chop
The wordsmith, I write in block letters of cursive
Curse my circus, serve this surface
And watch how the brother get over
The fly Cassanova with the frankincense odor
Bear witness
To where riches'll make career bitches share pictures
When the ears get this ya brains's software glitches
Splatter your brains
Leave scattered remains of matter and stains
That'll explain how you was battered and slain
I get rude and go, to your show and use your own
Fans to BOO and throw you off 'til you lose your flow
A pro, mean like Joe Greene when I blow steam
Put your whole team on pause like cold cream
They show laughter when I flow faster, your ho have to
Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya
I'm dapper plus ghetto and just pedal
When the dust settle we left in the rubble to crush metal
Nurses with hearses sealin' conversed with lit purses
Spit fire, make you first to bit, try me
Like Osama, or Dahmer, I'mma cause trauma
And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze

Kane baby, walk hard, the p-jects
On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of D-cepts
On streets of L.A. I'm a whole E-set
On tracks with Jurassic I be the T-Rex
Still that Gucci dressin', still that coochie pressin'
My pimp game smooth be-gets 'em
I don't use discretion; cop tends to be stressin'
Fuck explainin' it, who's he testin'?
Finsta perform all physical forms
Leave your ass shakin' like a Mystikal song
Please dumb, what type of shit was you on?
'Cause man to compress a nigga mean one less a nigga (uh-huh)
All I want is my niggas all recruitin' a slimmy
All I want is my liver all polluted with Remy
Duel with any, bring it, I face-off
Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball
Yeahhh, your majesty, word flash photography
Third class economy, blade slashed your artery
Nerve gassed anatomy, blurred past dramatically
Herbs hashed, my word splash packed agility
Never predictability
Manouvers of mind fully designed 'cause I'm true to the rhyme
We do the sublime, crackin' yo' backbone
Attackin' you wack clones
Vernacular right and exact, capital rap zone
That come back verbal assault rifle (ahhhhh)
We fight like Stokely Carmichael
Nope! We just like you
We broke and ain't no tellin' what we might do
Ain't no joke
Revoke the right to reverse to seek mercy
With the King Asiatic and Percee P
Ain't heard the worst of me, until your chest 3-D
Spit venom and burn your body like a STD

Put a 20 on the next brother steppin' to me wrong
I mess around a lick 'cause you done cheat on my theme song
This might seem wrong, but this is a mean song
Crushed like King-Kong, and just like ping-pong
Back and forth, I spit Molotovs, it's time to floss
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
When syllables slide you'll be enjoyin' the vibe
One consider it pride, it's J5
When another deadly medley, camera, action yo we heavy
Aim steady slash machette Maserati engine ready
Good and plenty don't be petty count the fetti and we jetti
Off to another city where we do our nitty-gritty
We wild like Serengeti, tear it down let's seek and set it
Get ready, for the ride, verbally hang-glide
Write and stay tight, mission's in sight
Murderer worldwide, the stage is yo' knife7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yo, this is a lesson in friendship
The depths of a kinship
What women and men begin with, and then slip
My pen drips
As I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
Of emotion
A fraction, seduction, attraction
Eruption of passion
Corrupts if a lasted friendship's involved
Would love to cross the line
But that’s why we built these walls

We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line

Opposites attract
When the female and male come in contact
Sticky situation in fact
Tryin not to let the feelings catch
But there's a thin line between both of y'all
So you respect that
And entertain the idea, but get brought back
To reality, and could you really live with that?
Decision, based on intuition
You love and keep your distance
Hug and kiss in friendship
An ongoing kinship, we was people to begin with
Disrespect was not intended
But your feelings sparked the sentence
Sometimes you're too intense in your quest to invent
The perfect man, please understand, my rhyme is your repent

We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line

Man, too bad that we became friends first
I'm not an expert on how relationships should work
But, (echos) from the minute it as known
It changed the whole tone on how we spoke on the phone
Yo, it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up
Over you, all my buddies would swoon
But I felt we were in tune, you let me up in your room. (Damn)
But to me girl, you're still off limits
No matter all the times that I hinted (Yo, whatchu doin after this?)
Infactuation was authentic, but yo I just pretended
So I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe, I should spill all my guts
Or write a letter, then tear it up
Or do a song, just to say what's up
I want just a touch
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line

I can't do this anymore
See my heart just spills out when you walk in the door
Friendship turns into lust and this only tip
That I can't comprehend even if I knew it
Can't do justice to these things that I'm feeling
You got someone else, don't wanna be caught stealing
Hell if she knew she would never leave us alone
In the roo-ooo-ooom

This was a lesson in friendship
I stress in this sentence
Should women and men be friends first?
And then slip?
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
Of devotion
Opposites attract
And best friends make a perfect match
If you only knew that
Once you cross, ain't no turning back
The minute you let him in it and he hit that
That's that

We was people to begin with, but you was too relentless
Jeopardizing kinship, respect is intended
Resolve is my intent
While we got it in
I'm tryin to salvage a friendship

We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Ayo my quality control, captivates your party patrol
Your mind, body, and soul
For whom the bell tolls, let the rhythm explode
Big, bad, and bold b-boys of old
Many styles we hold, let the story be told
Whether platinum or gold, we use breath control
So let the beat unfold, intro on drum roll

You set that mood when we groove and prove a show
The name of the game is survive and prove your flow
You can't out take Jurassic syllable
Cause it's survival of professional radio
Stop and comprehend and heed the words of my pen
Survival of professional poetical Highlanders

(Soup, you plan on rocking something fierce?) Oh, am I
Zaakir's the name, the A.K.A. super
The verbal acupunture from the dope old schooler
I used to be the brother for others that used to dumb on
Now they be the lovers of brothers that can't front on
Put me in the mix, LP 12-inch
SP, the elegant, poetic pestulence
I'm carbonated, the Fanti-confederated
Highly commemorated, and the most celebrated
For connecting it (Word!) Like verb subject to the predicate
Plus I got the etiquette
To keep it moving, and showing cats how it's done
Cause it's the verbal combat, position number one
We keep it beaming like a beacon, if it's lyrics that you're seeking
Whether black or Puerto Rican, people back us when we're speaking
We got the kind of rhymes that get you ready for the weekend
(To the mass amount of legions that came for party pleasing)
Our temperature is freezing all kind of different regions
The rhythm is the reason you're checking for what we've done
Please son, our thesis, will rip your crew in pieces
Your rhymes ain't ripe, homeboy, you ain't in season

Ayo my quality control, captivates your party patrol
Your mind, body, and soul
For whom the bell tolls, let the rhythm explode
Big, bad, and bold b-boys of old

Yo, yo, well it's the angelic man-relic clan repellent
My plan parent manuscripts withstand bullets
Flashing like a Japan tourist, we command pure hits
While you cramming to understand these contraband lyrics
My fam submits to pray, 5 times a day
Climbing into your mind with live rhyme display
J5 finds a way to remain supreme
Coming verbally Hardison as if my name was Kadeem
Ayo my team Dreamworks without Spielberg or spill words
Communicate from the Earth throughout the universe
I transmit, transcipts, transcontinental lyrics
Deeply rooted in your spirit
Up, I love the power of words, nouns and verbs
The pen and the sword, linguistic Art of War
No folklore or myths in my penmanship
The path of Scholar Warriors is what I present, uh
Verbally decapitating those against a
Jihad fi sabilillah, my words make sense
She gots to get up on your vocab, you gots to have vocab
Letters makes words, and sentences makes paragraphs

Yo, I make the pen capsize, the verbal with the planted eyes
Planning knives ever pair that I utilize
Spit juice, crack blood from your tooth
Inflict truths, speak Allah's 99 attributes

You baby MC's drink Pedialyte
While underground doesn't like you, the media might
But we the defeat will change that
As we bridge gaps in this lyrical grudge match, brothers we slug back
Yeah, we bless tracks with the help of a raw rap
Inprinted like poor tracks all over your brain rack
My mental maneuver will clear and steer right through ya
We Grand like Puba, understand that we move ya

Ayo, my rhythm reveal rollercoaster real deal
Revolutionize with active build
I plant my dreams in the field and wait to harvest my skills
For the starving MC, hungry trying to get a meal

Ayo my quality control, captivates your party patrol
Your mind, body, and soul
For whom the bell tolls, let the rhythm explode

Freedom (Freedom!)
Hold on to this feelin'
Freedom (Freedom!)

Yo, seldom travelled by the multitude
The Devil's gavel has a couple fooled
My culture's screwed 'cause this word is misconstrued
Small countries exempt from food 'cause leader have different views
You choose

What meen the world to me is bein' free
Live and let live and just let it be (Let it be)
Love peace and harmony, one universal family
One God, one aim and one destiny

(Oh Yeah?) Imagine life without a choice at all
Given no hope without a voice at all
These be the problems that we face
I'm talkin' poverty and race
But no matter what the case we gotta
Hold on to this feelin'
Freedom (Freedom!)
Hold on to this feelin'
Freedom (Freedom!)

Yo, I'm the first candidate to hate
Had to beat on the drum to communicate
For what was to come to those who were hung
They would decapitate the tongue if you would mention the word (Freedom)

Got people screamin' free Mumia Jamal
But two out of three of y'all will probably be at the mall
I'm heated with y'all, the defeated will fall
Incomplete and unsolved when the word freedom's involved

Yo, my forefathers hung in trees to be free (Rest in peace)
Got rid of slavery but still kept the penitentiary
And now freedom got a shotgun and shells with your name
Release the hot ones and let freedom reign

I'm the former vote prisoner
Hollywood visitor
Dance for cats segregated on wax
My color got me handi-cap Amos and Andy
For the freedom they just won't hand me
Hold on to this feelin', Freedom (Freedom!)
Hold on to this feelin', Freedom (Freedom!)

(Hold On)
'Cause there's not a lot of time (To)
Your heart, body, soul and your mind (This)
They're so true and they been hurtin' so long (Feelin')
That's the reason why we named this song (Freedom)

A don't stop stop your dreamin
Let yourself float apon the notion
We can work it out, we gon work it out baby
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now

We live and we learn, we crash and we burn
Right now my only rhyme is this lesson I learned
You talk about trust, I talk about lust
Its not appealin as you truly speak your feelings
I be lookin at the ceiling, so concealing
I shoulda put my heart on the table
Knowin I was good and able but instead I fed your fables
If I could have you back best believe it'd be forever
Cause each and every day you would hear those four letters

A don't stop stop your dreamin
Let yourself float apon the notion
We can work it out, we gon work it out baby
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now
These are different times but we feel the same pains
The blood of mankind runnin through the same veins
We'd like to make it right some which it remain tame
Same crimes even though they names changed
And we like different minds workin off the same brain
Passengers on different cars steppin off the same train
In the end, makin it rights the main aim
Different parts of the picture highlight the same frame

A don't stop stop your dreamin
Let yourself float apon the notion
We can work it out, we gon work it out baby
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now

Now if you know what I know you need to work it out
If you ain't happy with yourself you need to work it out
You havin problems with your family then work it
The things we go through just to work it
I work it out when the situations seems unworkable
Unreversible but God is most merciful
Many works, Many men converse
With soul search sweat it out
When they tryin to work it out
With the constant complaint, we other gonna make it fly
Or we ain't, I already know what some of ya think
Ima talk a hip hop and how bad its got
Then tryna pull a brother, im not
Lookin for nobody to judge, you said you ain't I never said you was
Im just tryna get with ya and pose in the same picture
So this mic thing can move the right thing do the right thing
Made for your life game, plus my man might sing

A don't stop stop your dreamin
Let yourself float apon the notion
We can work it out, we gon work it out baby
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now
A don't stop stop your dreamin
Let yourself float apon the notion
We can work it out, we gon work it out baby
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity

That's just the way we do it
That's just the way we do it
It's J5 in the house tonight
Yes sir, damn right we're in the house tonight

It's like front and center for those who don't get it
We hit it and stay committed, the skies is the limit
Rock on and twist it, hop it, don't stop it
Drop it like it's heavy when the DJ knock it

Tight swifts, so vivid, my folks is close knitted
With every note we're gon' get close to your spirit
If not post and pivot some folks just don't get it
We got a gross fetish for beats and dope lyrics

For real, watch my community as we stomp through your city
Destroying every and any club or academy
Rap style too plenty, baby, rain, snow or sunny
The game is nose runny, my team is your money

Yes, Lord, it's hard to not give us applause
Accolades and awards, they even out the odds
A little fire the bars, a flame you can't dodge
We kill 'em and play hard with with 'em 16 bars

We like to mash off, bogart, kill it when the track's hard
Yes, y'all, fresh, y'all, flyest shit you ever saw
A to the K, I to the L rock well
Hit the block, tip topping every jail cell

Push the panic button cause we like a planet comin'
Vicious avalanche or something plus I ain’t retracting nothing
Enough said, we roll with rough dreads
You old and busted, my crew we hustling

Yeah, we grandslam when we can’t stand fishes
One hell of a band and my plans ambitious
We allergic to lies and to ham sandwiches
We stay flexible for if the grand plan switching

So if by chance you catch a glimpse
Of the West co-representative, 5 star commemorative
Rap far from primitive, inventive
Just hear it and remember it’s us, J5

Yo, we came to push up on ya
Southern California, top notch performer
With the corner of Roma
Run up on ya, yeah, tell it to a friend
We suck it up and blow it out in the wind

And we come from the beginner, never been a pretender
Seven letters and put ‘em together, kill the competitor
Better than most, we servin’ devils for dinner
Tryna get to one of the seven levels agenda, for real

We set trends and never follow behind
My crew be swallowing rhymes while you following dimes
We take it to the limit, no gimmicks or false images
Style is all scrimmage, that’s why I’m all linen

We certified to vibe and cutting off the air supply
We kick, spit, stab and kill every vocab
The minute we go back,  the old school rhythm we shown that
Alot of cats wish to throwback

Yo, I create off drum drops and ate away blacktops
Grab the mic so you don't react
The double X Polo shirt with the hat to match
In fact, we verbally vibrate your track

Then crush your confidence like plastic condiments
Build you up to break you down like forgotten monuments
The question is this: will they return with the hot shit?
Or keep it on the low flow

Yo, and for you confused bastards, Tuna the blues master
Quick to grib the mic, crews fast and soundclashing
Critical mass, pitiful blast have been deflected
Hypodermic vocals I flash get you infected

I don't sip on brew, so this Bud's for you
Speak when spoken to whenever you come through
My vibes fill you, Internal your Revenue
You rhyme prostitute for little or no loot

'Cause a lotta these kids think that commercial
Is rocking fly suits and jewelry
But we can rock shows with no rehearsal
With the Rebels of Rhythm and Unity
Yeah, 'cause I'm nice, smooth, hard as a bone
Since I pick up the microphone I'm hotter than brimstone
The razor sharp crossbow accurate
We drop the multiverbal milligram suppliment

Plus in bed, theological word advance
Been Too Legit To Quit before the Hammer pants
The parent to the pen converts words to song
Stay blacker than the New York Harlem Renaissance

No comp, we paint a darker picture, in your sector
Perfect verbal architecture, sparking lectures
Lyrics infectious, fuck your Lexus
If you ain't giving God your praise then it's useless
When MC's try to make hits and them shits flop
Running races like they was Penelope Pitstop
Develop these hits rock bottom, the disk jock got 'em
Souped up, but his rhyme is beating his loops up

Like dah dah (Like dah dah)
Bah dee dee dee dah dah (Dah dee dee dee dah dah)
Bah dah dah dah dee dee dee dee dah dah
I can see clearly now, top of the pile with my style
Check the profile, it shifts like sundials
Crisp like young smiles, we rip and run wild
Intent to rock crowds, some bite like rottwilds

Your game is disconnected, misdirected
Disrespected, when we come in, expect some next shit
The J-U-R-A, classical forte
Get low down & dirty like the eel moray

My heart pump the rhythm of the militant street life
Soldier of composure up under the street light
The coat style, prototype, professional
Media light shine bright, now kill all the
Bullshit, cheap talk and lip service
Jealousy and envy and undertone curses in your verses
Serve the purpose of a nigga living nervous
Unsure and uncertain but about to short circuit

Like dah dah (Like dah dah)
Bah dee dee dee dah dah (Bah dee dee dee dah dah)
Bah dah dah dah dee dee dee dee dah dah
Like dah dah (Like dah dah)
Bah dee dee dee dah dah (Bah dee dee dee dah dah)
Bah dah dah dah dee dee dee dee dah dah
Ayo my gift of gab should be sold in bags
Boost up the price tag, make a wack rapper mad
Rely on my right side, securing our tape tight
Tasty tangibles to your mandible and clavicle

Yo, easily 2na be, cleverly swelling my treasury
Vocal pedigree for you critics who try to measure me
But easily I'm about to run you down my resume
Had a bundle of struggle from birth to my present day

Yo, your love don't compute, perhaps you need a boost
A magical flute, some nose candy to toot
Before you get loose, express and tear the roof
You claim you got the juice, but you lame and out the loop

So I associated myself with fossilized figures
Crack the summer sizzler, hit the real live niggas
My influence is gunshots and trauma units
Street trends, with material word friends

Like dah dah (Like dah dah)
Bah dee dee dee dah dah (Bah dee dee dee dah dah)
Bah dah dah dah dee dee dee dee dah dah
Like dah dah (Like dah dah)
Bah dee dee dee dah dah (Bah dee dee dee dah dah)
Bah dah dah dah dee dee dee dee dah dah

Hey I'm Sean Lennon, and you're listening to Jurassic 5

Yo, because of cash in the purse, guns blast in the hearse
A vast universe when the last is the first
The past been a curse, I need some asprin to nurse
It's your casket in earth, or my ass when it hurts
A passionate burst of some last-minute work
First the human bodies are living last in this Earth
Puffing grass when it works, a bastard at birth
But at last planet Earth, 5 Jurass finish first
(Stashed in this verse) Burning like gas on a torch
(Graspin' a thought) Some don't see past their front porch
(Masked in a smirk) No doubt my class been alert
Verbal splash for your thirst, 5 Jurass finish first

Yo, because of crooks in the game no one's acting the same
Not mentioning no names, merely passing the blame
Your ass been in flames since the cash went ka-chang
Now you can't stand the rain when my crew bring the pain
You a masculine myth who I constantly diss
As I bond with the Fish, understand we the 5th
Platoon, hit the dirt, wish you well, wish you worse
Your ass been cursed, 5 Jurass finish first
Bringing it back from the lost, we have to report
The trash on the chart make you have to resort
To leave the record store instead of quenching your thirst
But at last planet Earth, 5 Jurass finish first
Yo, because of past intercourse wife asking divorce
Taking half of your cash, now you bask in remorse
Turning rap into sport, I've mastered the part
Cause the trash on the chart leave you gaspin for art
Now if you've mastered the art, I'm askin with force
To mass of your thoughts, to your ass is a corpse
Cover grass in a burst, unfasten your purse
Give your cash to the clerk, 5 Jurass finish first

Yeah, cause of tricks of the trade, some are virtual slaves
A smirk will get raised once the pen hits the page
While your thoughts of the stage and perhaps getting paid
Relax in the shade, time passing in days
I'm searching for ways to avoid the charade
Cause when voices are laid, choices are made
Be not afraid, people plastic on Earth
Verbal blast bout to burst, 5 Jurass finish first
5 Jurass finish first
5 Jurass finish first

Yo, because of passing the torch, puffing pipes with a bouche
You a hype living loose with your life in the noose
You invite many fools when you ligt chemicals
Night of the living ooze, your ego makes many bruise
You need to watch what you choose, what you give is what you get
Some are lacking intellect in their quest for a check
Is it love or respect, does the subject get you vexed?
Only 4 bars to wreck, the situation is complex

Yo, you in constant pursuit to be the last in the house
(Where's your wallet?) With the wife, deep stashed in her blouse

Like "Without a Doubt" you can catch me on the B-side
Cause the one who wins the war...

Is the one without pride
J5 make you feel a lickle gaseous at first
(Martin Lawrence) And yes I make you ask "Is that Lurch?"
Either try this or lyrical madness that works
Give your cash to the clerk, 5 Jurass finish first

This is Soup's father, yo Soup
He'd always take my, my old collections, I've got a lot collections of all kind of music
And he would always take my tapes and he plays my tapes and I look for my tapes
But I can't find my tapes and he got them, got them in his room, in the mirror
He is singing and he is dancing
And oh man I used to get so tired of that, but I liked it
Cause I knew, I knew that this young man was, was gonna do something with what his singing is
He created a good singer, he can rap but his a good singer too
He, he would just tear up  up my old, my old fat domino records and he'd just be OHHHHHH
He, he was good at, but he is a good rapper and, and I'm proud of my son and I'm proud of him
I'm proud of the fella's that are singing and rapping with him
Its good to see that, I knew he could do it
Hey Charlie this is your momma, where you at somewhere rapping?
Meet me somewhere, goin to look for you a real job
Go get you a job somewhere pay some bills and stuff
Not with some rapping, rapping, rapping that's all you want to think about, is rapping
Go get you a job boy..EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah, testing, testing, one two
Uhh, one
Press the panic button God

We be the crew, guess who, the Jayou
R-A-double-S, I-C, we're
In the place to be, it don't stop
We got the rhythm that makes your fingers
Snap, crackle, pop pop, fizz fizz
We're known to give a show plus handle our biz-ness
Stress, we'll destroy
We're known to make noise as the original b-boys
In the flesh, greater to the depth
Creates the ill scenes when we manifest, yes
I feel the vibe
I feel the vibe too
Cause it's the butter from the crew
Cause we original, who
Wanna tussle?
Flex for the muscle?
While we kick the style that busts your blood vessels
With the rhythm
The ninety-six stylism
Pick up a pill and feel em kill em with your vocalism
Yeah, I shoot the gift puffin another cold spliff
Fools are coming quicker than Anna Nicole Smith
Malignant metaphors and ganja stay herbs
We conjugate verbs and constipate nerds like you
I'm hear to end the conspiracy, fearlessly
So you can really see the real MC's (at hand)
I'm tuna fish on the stickshift
The eclectic hectic, desperate to set trip
Fo' the niggas who feel, that they're 24-karat
Plus, the way you're livin get your underwater baptism
Believe it or not, it's the rugged and raw
Put a bullet in the head of four in Mount Rushmore
Yeah, release the beast from within, baptise gins
Keep company with friends that repel sin
I'm out to win ain't no pretendin, fuck the first amendment
My speech was free, the day that my soul descended

Earthbound, we break sound barriers
Some niggas can rhyme, but they got no character
So we preparin you for war, don't give up the fight
You need to stand up for your rights
And grab a mic and get loose, produce the juice that keeps the head on
Collision with the New World Order opposition
Competition, none, there's only one in the universe
That knows the final outcome
We got incarcerated minds, men women and enzymes
Vibin' off the rhymes sent from the di-vine essence
Presence effervescence, not to be contested
Some miss the message, go ahead and bless this
So don't mistake us for a crew that used to hit
We on some underground seventy-five Wild Style shit

We be the crew, guess who, and it'll be
The J-U, ninety-five A.D
Be be causin ramifications, physicians
Sendin brothers on grammar vacations, if they don't listen
Competition, bustin shots on people basin
But we can delete constipation

Jurassic, 5, MC's
And we got the cure for this rap disease
So come on everybody let's all get down
Cause I'm down by law and I know my way around
The powerful, editEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Never, think just for shits and giggles
Do we spit syllable riddles for bits and kibbles
So chicks can wiggle and shake
Cuz this image is fake

I’m trying hard to relate in a place filled with so much hate

Some brothers debate some love and some hate
Whatever the case its all about the choices you make
That’s the reason you balloon'll deflate

But do beleive we trying to rap back to its primitive state
Wait

No overnight success or running with vets
Just pure unadulterated work progress
I’m willing to bet the farm you’ll give you right arm
For a piece of the pie ask yourself why

If you only knew, the trials and tribulations we’ve been through
But if you only knew, we real people homie just like you
We humble but don’t mistake us for some corny ass crew
What we do is try to give you whatcha ain’t used to
Soul music something we can all relate to
I ams what I am and that’s all I can be
No more no less what you seeing is me
Akil the MC W-I-S-E
Wise intelligent God did bless me

Yes we rock up off all the SP freshly especially
Dangerous rough and deadly

The pimp positioner
Tip the Richter scale

Alone we sink together we sail and prevail
The rum raisin', coming through Guns blazin’
Some of you duns running through ones with none savin’
Complainin’, me and my clan are unscathin’
From the soul comes something amazing

If you only knew, the trials and tribulations we’ve been through
But if you only knew, we real people homie just like you
We humble but don’t mistake us for some corny ass crew
What we do is try to give you whatcha ain’t used to
Soul music something we can all relate to
How many times I gotta hear some fanatic in my ear
Tellin me to keep it real when they ain’t payin my bills
Or feeding my kids, judging me on how I live
If my crib in the hood or if its up in the hills

Have you forgotten who you are?
O you think you’re a star
Why you frontin’ (you ain’t nothing)
You went from nothing to something
But something means nothing
If your people still wanting

And you got money ain’t givin’ them nothing

Flossin and frontin

Your game of charades
The way you behave
The image you save
Your brother thats one big parade
I’m sick of your ways
I’m sitting here spitting the phrase
The next time they smile and they wave
Will probably be with the gays
If you only knew, the trials and tribulations we’ve been through
But if you only knew, we real people homie just like you
We humble but don’t mistake us for some corny ass crew
What we do is try to give you whatcha ain’t used to
Soul music something we can all relate to
Soul, soul, soul, soul..

Ayo, it's like this when the Lord says "Let it be light"
We are some designated, poetical brothers with mics
For whoever had skills to possess the gift
Combinated with the flavor and it go like this...Tuna Fish!

I'm amphibious, citizen with the lesson plan
Cashier at the J5 concession stand (Akil!)

The militant steel with the peripheral
Telegraphic skill build up force field (Mark 7even!)

Fundamentalist bringing my verbal gift
My style is packed Quik like cocoa in Swiss Miss (Zaakir!)

For the way my pen sticks to rhymes
Cause a million party people, it's about that time

And together, we'll show you how to improvise
Reminiscent of the Wild Style '75
Cause it's the brothers on the mic occupying the drum
Taking four MC's and make them sound like one
I be the spark from the cannon, blaze the outstanding
Tug of war, with the poor, rich, and scandalous
Roadrunning bandit, race against advancement
Style winds cause storms when I perform

I'm a Parker John robot and stomp your whole spot
And beat you whole crew to a bunch of know-nots
Dissect you from the inner then declare myself the winner
Once the style clears, you'll be grilled like dinner

I'm 2na the Black, your contractor
Attacking your backdoor, you're trapped in my trash compactor
Move back, bore, swingings before the trap door
It's causin the capture of brothers who rap more

Yeah, check the shelling, rock niggas redder than watermelon
The grief-stricken, rotated 20/20 vision
Rap felon, hottest rebel with bad spelling
I pitch shift with unprecedented sharpness

Distributor, local street corner contributor
Word inhibitor, scientific impositioner
Rhythm Commission DJs for real
"He drives the crossfader like a cutmobile"
We perpetrate the fake, the fraud, the phony
Jurassic Masters of the Ceremony
You came and saw them right before your eyes
In fact the old school flavor has survived, like this...
(Instrumental breakdown)
And together, we show you how to improvise
Reminiscent of the Wild Style '75
Cause it's the brothers on the mic occupying the drum
We taking four MC's and make 'em sound like one
And together, we show you how to improvise
Reminiscent of the Wild Style '75
So whoever bought the tape bring your butt right back
Cause you never in your life heard a cut like that

Hey, we flip fast phonographs 45 records smash
Hot weather forecast, ain't nothing they never had

Make a move, never lose, competition quick to choose
New styles, hot rhymes, guarenteed to blow your mind
(Who is he?) The subtle ?? fanatic for unity
Demonstratin the ghetto diplomatic immunity
Well I'm the style stimulist, sound photosynthesis
Super with the sentences in the Latin centuries

And together, we'll show you how to improvise
Reminiscent of the Wild Style '75
Cause it's the brothers on the mic occupying the drum
Taking four MC's and make them sound like one
And together, we'll show you how to improvise
Reminiscent of the Wild Style '75
Cause it's the brothers on the mic in the place to be
It's the J-U-R-A double S I-CEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

J-U-R-A-S-S-I-C-F-I-V-E
(Chali 2-na)
He who is without sin
Cast the first stone
Blast the verse
No matter the class
I'm vers'tile
Kickin' it for you hipocritic berzerk ohms
I'm hopin' at worst
Hopin' the words that touch home
And clutch domes
Ya' think
Electrical sockets and wet feet
How you infinitely get sleep
The minute we get deep
Ladies and 'gents peep
One hundred percent heat
Up undersea mistreats
Now I'll leave you mince meat
Yes I'm from UNITY
My last name sits in the middle of opportunity (Huh)
With two-laid plans and new-made fans
My crew raid lands and punch like the Kool-Aid Man
Chorus:
(All)
It was a long road to glory
(All)
Battle for territory
Just to be called the masters of the ceremony
Marathon
Decathalon
Word-play
Mega-bomb
Metabolism
With the rhythm
Keep it goin' on

(Soup)
The epitomy
Five-hundred thousand so convincingly
Street ministry
J-5th-a-tune infantry
Finna be
About to be
The best kept commodity
Twelve incher LP
We're representin' properly
Now possibly the knock could be
That old school philosophy
That if it doesn't rock a beat
It's not considered property
Remember me
Remember us
Ice Cold
Cold Crush
1920 Gold Rush
Rollin' up
Hold up!
Now ain't no need
For you to be surprised
When we impliment and improvise
With each and every verse that I
Get busy with
Lacing it with murder talk
Turn a 'sault
Tom-A-Hawk
Razor sharp
Tribal walk
(All)
Fresh gear
We're makin' our beds
And we're doin' lots of things
That we never did
We went to Paris in the spring-time
Bahamas in the fall
We thank Alla
We're doin' it all
Chorus
(Marc-7even)
Pick a paragraph and phrase it
Mentally you save it
Kick it to the world and
Suddenly they crave it
Thats the way it is
In this verbal warfare
Workin' hard for the love
But there ain't no wars here
Years been puttin'
On a play with your foot in
Cause you'll be comin' back
Like the brother Dwight Gooden
Seven's back again
Slappin' men and askin' them
If they really wanna fuck wit' the style we tappin' in
(Akil)
Hey yo, I just couldn't wait
To grab a piece of my own cake
So I can elevate
And hold my own weight
My mind state be the ghetto
Street corner heavy metal
Black like the pot and tea kettle
My street credibility
Minus negativity
Multiplied energy
What attends a few
Ability sililoque
Of a real MC
Tastin' the grammar
J5 slamma jamma
Chorus
(OH) (Here we go)
Metabolism with the rhythm
Keep it goin' on

Yo wassup, Ak

Hello? what? (Hello?) I can't hear (I GOT IT! HANG UP!)
Yo speak louder I can't hear
(Zaakir)
(Yo Ak) Yo It's me Zaakir!
I was sittin at the television feelin' disturbed
Hey yo, I just got the word, off Tigram and 83rd
Some cat that got clapped, (gangster rapper?)
Perhaps, But I was lookin at the face of one particular cat
Now I done seen him before, (Can you remember where at?)
Well it was either at the liquor store or laundry mat
Or at a party and shit, ?or drive through of a quickie split?
But the fellas her ran wit, they no longer ex-- (yo, dude peep this)
(Akil)
Yo I know dude, I been knowin him all my life
Ever since I was young I used to see him shootin' dice
On occasion I would see him once or twice
With all types, many different walks of life
He tried to keep in touch, but I knew what was up
Every time he came around and showed his face I ducked
In the mid-eighties, the nigga went crazy
He had alot of ladies selling they babies, the nigga was shady
But he had alot of friends that he would visit on the weekends
Thrill seekin, influenced by his teachings
My daddy knew him, yo, he met him at a hotel
My homeboy Johnny, kicked it with him in a jail cell
Alot of people met him with a female
Doing real well, connected with the drug sales
The rich and the poor, for better or worse
The last and the first, walked the earth, but can't avoid his turf
And it hurts my brain, he's drivin me insane
It's a shame I can't remember his name
I think 2na know dude, Soup, I ain't tryin ta be dude
But my wife just cooked, im bout to grab up some food
(Zaakir)
Aiight peace, 2na said he probably runnin the streets
I'm about to give these young brothas a beep
(ring ring)
(2na)
Yo! Aalaam ulaikum
(Zaakir)
Yo, ulaikum asalaam
(2na)
Heyyo, what's up on 83rd man?
(Zaakir)
Man, the feudin' is on
Hey, the reason why I called, that was the cat from my building
You seen him?
(2na)
Yeah we met that brother out in Pasadena
Remember, 7even?
(7even)
On Marengo
(2na)
No my mistake, we were right between Fair Oaks and Lake
Tryin to take us a lunch break
(Marc7even)
And cop us a sess sack!
(2na)
But had to drive right past the place where they rest at
(7even)
We drove in a hatchback
(2na)
Corolla, these cats pack pistolas, the cadillac they drove
(7even)
It was brown and black
(2na)
Patrollin the hood, lookin for trouble
Saw us purchasin trees
Lurkin with speed, pulled the strap, and was hurtin to squeeze
(7even)
You ?jerk? and you bleed
(2na)
Threw it in reverse and we fleed
(7even)
Or should we say fled?
(2na)
They wanted to make us more than play dead, flashin his heat
(7even)
Two cars are movin fast on the street
(2na)
That's when I peeped, that dude was in his back passenger seat
(yo that shit was deep) Still I can't remember his name..
*this suckas gonna get us killed*
*now come on man I feel like cuttin loose*
*violence*
*you behave yourself*
(Zaakir)
Oh man, where have I seen this brother before, man
*well it was either at the liquor store or laundry mat*
Seem like everybody I know know dude, but can't nobody remember his damn name
Man
*I been knowin him all my life*
The same with everybody from ShawnyMac, YawYaw, my brother Mohamad
Its like you can't *can't avoid his turf*
Oh, hey, you know what, now I know who homie is man, his name is

(This record is particularly good for the youngsters)
(Now you get right to the procedure)
Now what do you like the most about this
Conflict, consequence, constant evidence
A classic content communicated conference
Whether 5 or 6 whether a number misprint
Or if it seems that you heard it before
If you thought that you would never hear it no more
You should never doubt when we runnin word o' mouth
Be concerned about your health (let's go!)
(wait wait yourself)
Now you know us but it's not the Cold Crush
Four MC's so we ain't the Furious
Not the Force MC's or the 3 from Treacherous
It's a blast from the past from the moment we bust
From whatever we touch, we hold platinum plus
But if our shit go rust, still In God We Trust
Cause it's the second coming
Display a rhyme so stunning
We keep it runnin, and give a shoutout to (London)
And keep it all, and still perform till the early morn'
Sunset til dawn
I got a word abundance, hold pens by the hundreds
Top speed, guaranteed, we still runnin
I be boombastic
With my terror tactics
Why you actin plastic
Treatin all ya fans like fanatics
We be the upper pair comin' air-tight like Tupperware
Fuck a fear, press ya luck and beware the brigadier
Yea, DJ's spinnin the records that make up the music
So people can focus whenever the mic has been passed to me
(The more drums we have in our kit, the more jobs we can handle)
(We gonna take a break here)
(Lets go. wait wait yaself)
Je m'appelle, A-K-I-L known to exhale when I inhale
And you can tell when in the crew I do my duty-o
And swung to the studio
J-5 let the beat bounce
That's what counts without a doubt
So Soup grab the mic and pull the magic out ya mouth
We be the rhythm kings, plus rhyme channelling
(I could snare anything) (Go ahead)
(Snare) 
(Light)
Emcee can't match this phatness so we practice
Burnin through walls of wackness
Yo, 2 emcees add a little more spice
So we concentrate on mic's to keep them packed parties tight
(THREE) emcees underground and worldwide
Surgeon general notify that the 5 is certified
(FOUR) emcees at your door once more
When it rains it pours from the heavens to the Earth floor
(FIVE) Elements, vocal instruments super extra strength hip-hop activist
(FIVE) For your mind no time and intertwine
Roll with the rhymes sunset to sunrise
(FIVE) You should know, when we flow, you get what you lookin for
(FIVE) Terrorize ya enterprise
Cuz we don't shoot until we see the whites of ya eyes
Non-stop, real rhyme rockin disc jockeys out record shoppin
Writers doin graphs so bring ya pop lockin
We incorporate the whole of hip hoppin
Non-stop
We keep it up to par
From the metal monkey bars to concrete school yards
It's like written Arabic, comin from right to left
It's hot to def so take a breath and (wait wait yourself)
(Applause + Laughter)
(Skit)

Sparkin' extreme spinach
Watchin' your scene plumett
If lyrics were green vomit
My vocals would clean stomachs
Addicts wean from it
Where dreams and green run it
The faces on money change like the host on Teen Sumit
I'm close to being done with this industry's cream driven
Supreme livin', seein' more demons than Gene Simmons
And mean fibbin' actors be adlibbin'
Fakin' the funk and some of us naturally had rhythm
Some of us act like they had women
Gats in the abdomen back when the fact is them cats
They didn't have nuttin
For certain I'm sure it's fiction but for some
The purest diction
Insures their jurisdiction
I'm kicking it up a level trying to stay in the red
Some stay in the bed, zombie
Like the Day of the Dead
With decay in the head
Playin' instead of stayin' ahead
Steadily portrayin' celebs, delayin' the inevitable
When some come round
They run down when they touch ground
They climb up the structures unsound
Some of you like the way my words caress tracks
While some of these politicians secretly suppress facts
Chorus: (2X)
I'm sayin' through songs I write
My wrongs I right
If you wanna fight the power
Get the power to fight
Cuz some of us judge without knowing the man's inner
And some of us find fault in the sin and not the sinner

Influential ideas
Push pressure on my peers
That's why most of these brothers have short term careers
You appear to be what's happenin'
For a year you crackin'
One hitter quitter now you missin' in action
With no satisfaction from the streets
I only hear foolishness when you speak
I repeat, my predecessor's endeavor with pleasure
Lock and load, explode and come better
Hopin that generation X
Be more wicked with the flex
And not so quick to cash a check
And disrespect, talkin' guns and sex
Chasin' death, but end up gettin' layed to rest
At your request
You're at the end of your line
Out of your mind
Idle women, weed and wine
And shells for your nine
The blind lead the blind
Time after time
When you rhyme for the shine
Chorus (2X)

Yo, I'm tellin' you to REBEL
But dude, if you stale
The 2na can tell
Either you're comin' to the party or you truant as hell
Politicians ain't got no problem puttin' you in the cell
It's like we rolled up a snowball and threw it in hell
See some of us are looted with mail and suited to swell
But still blind like you're fluent in Braille

Yo, I never can tell uh, why some make it or fail
Speak it and spell overcome and still prevail

We ripple the water frequently
Blink if we show delinquency, please
Human frequencies
Have been diseased, A breeze ain't what I'm feelin'
Healin' is essential
Mental aggrivation shows you what we've been through

Yo, sign of the times influence the way I rhyme, man
Pick up a nine and put down your picket sign, man
Your life is worth way more than just some diamonds
Without bling I still gleam
Glisten and shine, man
Chorus (2X)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

All right, everybody shut up
I said shut up!
Now are you ready to play the game?
NO!
Are you ready to play the game?
YEAH!
The Game
Playing to survive
Aiming to win anyway they can

Yo, yo
Pass the ball, final casting call
First of all, verbal basketball
Off the glass, smash your jaw
Too fast for y'all
You might take a nasty fall
Trying to stick with the prehistoric passenger
(Foul Ball)
All breath, no physical contact
Bounce back, demonstrate invincible bomb raps
Not no hustler no player or speakin no crime crap
I'm vocally trying to score before my time lapse
Uh! Full court press, hands in your chest
Runnin' cause I'm a rebel with the ghetto
No fouls just checks, make a brother sweat
Word for y'all to earn my reject
Get it out of here, attack from the rear
Ya'll niggas ain't nothin but some bitch ass queers
I'll be in your ear, increase the fear
Rippin with the shears as the crowd just cheers
Bring on the opposition
Cause my position is to shut you down
As the basketball pounds on the parquet floor
Envisioning moves to freak brothers every which way
Dominating like Doc J
Pass me the rock, I know just what to do with it
It's real vivid, I pivot, through the lane
Three hundred and sixty behind my back
I take your monkey ass to the rack like Jerry Stack
I'm saw by most recruiters and heavily recommended
Stickin your best shooters they lower verbal percentage
It's takin its toll, 24-second clock control
Stoppin this obstacle, impossible
I was the number one ???? project in the city
Prospect, now thats something that you can believe
So be it, whether pro or collegiate, the hit but don't miss
Prime time the offense, switch
Y'all can't ball, Y'all can't ball
Yo ref, where's the tech? Man, make the call
The game is gettin tight verbal victories in sight
What counts is what you write not concerned about the hype
My rhymes go baseline so why you tryin to take mine?
Last man tried just died inside the paint line
I bank rhymes, got a call so I flex
I'm on the foul line with a few verses left
When my flow hits the net, the next brother flex
I put my foot in the pavement
With the brothers I'm raised with
Play with and break dance back in the days with
And still in the game with 12 points, 4 assists
Get up in the game, in your face like swish
Crash the boards with metaphors
In the air like a concord
Aiyyo what you out for?
Yo I'm out for the whole score
22 flat seconds for me to win
I can't win for losin with this cheatin ass ref

My squad's supreme
So I don't need Clyde or the dream
Next time you play the game boy pick a better team
Your choice is short when you on a concrete court
But my mental cohorts is bout to change the whole sport
Give me the pill boy, crossover with the skills
Wrap around pass, fly right past your grill
Take off from half court, in some J5 shorts
The rap band with the man when my words play sports
Comin' through your lane, with pure skills so stand clear
Vocal charge is a mirage, I still stand here
Damn near, make your shit look soft like Pam Grier
Fans cheer for the paragraph Bill Lambier
Show me the rock, so I can show these fool what I got
(He's heating up) Fuck that, I'm flaming hot
Verbally take you to the blacktop, and wreck shop
Turn my game up a notch, pass me the rock
1 on 1, 3 on 3, 5 on 5, horse, 21
It really don't matter cause son you'll still get done
Yo you should know better than try to barter with this globetrotter
Militious, vicious dunks, I'm Vince Carter
And it's the high draft pick, flashin it
Still can penetrate and slightly overweight
But whatever it takes my shot can elevate
No pain, no gain for the brothers with no gameEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
