That's the one, oi
How did he not find the baggy
With his hand in my shoe?
Way too close for me
Oh well, at least they allowed me through
Should be a good night in here
Rammo in the main room
People keep pushing me though
No reception on the phone

And I'm thinking
Lights are blinding my eyes
They said they'd be here, they said
They said in the corner
And I'm thinking
People pushing by
Then walking off into the night

These look well speckled
A bit green and blue
Threes is well cheap though
So I'll take three if I need to
Right, I'm on a plan
I wish the bouncers'd go away
Borrow water off this man
Here goes nothing, okay
And I'm thinking
Lights are blinding my eyes
Oh, that's proper rank
That tastes like hairspray
And I'm thinking
People pushing by
Then walking off into the night

I hate coming to the entrance
Just to get bars on my phone
You have no new messages
So why haven't they phoned?
Menu: write message
"So where are you and Simone?"
Send message: Dan's number
"Where have they gone?"

And I'm thinking
Lights are blinding my eyes
Why's the message pending?
Where the fuck are ya?
And I'm thinking
People pushing by
Then walking off into the night
Hmm, brandy or beer?
Water's a good idea
I wish that bar lady'd appear
And come serve over here
Where the fuck could they be?
Still not over in the corner
This night's a tragedy
I keep thinking I saw her

And I'm thinking
Lights are blinding my eyes
No, that's not them
That's not them either
And I'm thinking
People pushing by
Then walking off into the night

I'm still not feeling anything
This has got to be a dud
It's been ages since I necked it
I smoked six tabs to the nub
Belly's not even tingling
I just feel a bit pissed
No-one looks like mingling
I can't see her or him
And I'm thinking
Lights are blinding my eyes
I'm gonna do another I think
Yeah, one more, these are shit
And I'm thinking
People pushing by
Then walking off into the night

These toilets are a piss-take
Queue's bigger than the door
Gotta get rid of this pill taste
What are they chatting so much for?
Glad I'm not a girl in this place
They'll be here 'til dawn
Sure my belly's tingling a bit
Something's happening, I'm sure

And I'm thinking
Lights are blinding my eyes
Maybe I shouldn't have done the second one
I feel all fidgety and warm
And I'm thinking
People pushing by
Then walking off into the night

Whoa, everything in the room's spinning
I think I'm gonna fall down
My heart's beating too quick
I'm fucking tripping out
I wonder whether they got in?
Turned away, no doubt
Who cares? This is a tune coming in
That one noise is like

I'm thinking
Lights are blinding my eyes
My eyes are rolling back
I'm rubbing my thighs with my hand
And I'm thinking
People pushing by
Then walking off into the night

Yeah, yeah, they cheer
Can they see my hand in the air?
I need to wave 'em over here
I swear Simone's kissing Dan
My head's twisted severe
Body is rushing everywhere
They could have texted me when they were near
But I'm fucked and I don't care

Lights are blinding my eyes
What was I thinking about?
Ah, who cares
I'm mashed
People pushing by
Then walking off into the night
Totally fucking
Can't hardly fucking stand
This is fucking amazing

Excuse me, girl
I know it's a bit embarrassing but I just noticed some tan lines
On your shirt

See, I reckon you're about an eight or a nine
Maybe even nine and a half in four beers' time
That blue Topshop top you've got on, it is nice
Bit too much fake tan, though, but yeah, you score high
But there's just one little thing that's really, really
Really, really annoying me about you, you see
Yeah, yeah, like I said, you are really fit
But my gosh, don't you just know it?

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

So when I looked at you standing there with your horde
I was waiting in the queue, looking at the board
Wondering whether to have a burger or chips
Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford
When I noticed out the corner of my eye
Looking toward my direction, your eyes locked on my course
I couldn't concentrate on what I wanted to order
Which lost me my place in the queue I waited for, yeah
I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Whoa! (Leave it out)
Are you smoking crack or something? (Leave it out)
Mike, just leave it, just leave it
We cannot have that behaviour in this establishment (Leave it out)
It's not worth it, Mike, just leave it
Don't touch me
It's not worth it
Don't touch me (Leave it out)
Don't t—look, I'm alright, don't touch me

For a while there I was thinking, "Yeah, but, what if?"
Picturing myself pulling with bare white hot wit
Snaring you as you were standing there opposite
Whether or not you knew it, I swear you didn't tick
And when that bloke in the white behind us lot queuing
Was clocking onto you too, yeah, I had to admit
That yeah, yeah, you are fit and yeah, I do want it
But I stop sharking a minute to get chips and drinks
I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Now, I bashed my head hard earlier due to the brew
But I am digressing slightly, so I’ll continue
I didn’t want to bowl over all geezer and rude
Not rude like 'good', but just rude like 'uncouth'
You girls think you can just flirt and it comes to you
Well, let me tell you, see, yes, yes, you are really rude
And rude as in 'good', I knew this as you stood and queued
But I just did not wanna give this satisfaction to you

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Oi, and just as you started to make your big advance
With the milkshake and that little doughnut in hand
I was like, nah, I can't, even though you look grand
But you look sharp there, smiling hard, suggesting and
Gleaming away with your hearty, hearty-looking tan
But I admit the next bit was spanner to my plan
You walked towards my path but you just brushed right past
And into the arms of that fucking white-shirted man
I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Oh, oi, what do I give a fuck? I've got a girlfriend anyway
(Whoa, we've all had a drink, mate...)
We're all a bit drunk, we've had a few, fair play
I got this Stella I bummed from that last cafe
This night's not even begun, yes, yes, oh yay
I did fancy you a bit, though, yeah, I must say
I would rather I hadn't mugged myself on display
But this is just another case of female stopping play
In an otherwise total result of a holiday

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Haha, huh, huh, huh
You're fit but you know it
You're fit but you know it
You're fit but you know it
I think I'm going to fall over
I think I'm going to fall o–
Fucking hell4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Make yourself at home
We got diesel or some of that homegrown
Sit back in your throne and turn off your phone
'Cause this is our zone
Videos, televisions
64s, PlayStations
Weigh up Henry with precision
Few herbs and a bit of Benson
But don't forget the Rizla
Lean like the Tower of Pisa
These are, I'll raise ya
And this is the day in the life of a geezer
For this ain't a club track
Pull out your sack and sit back
Whether you white or black
Smoke weed, chase brown or toot rock
We're on a mission, support the cause
Sign a petition, summon all your wisdom
The music's a gift from
The man on high, the Lord and his children
Triple team here of rudeboys
Come rain or snow, the boodah flows
You don't know? Stand on the corner, watch the show
'Cause life moves slow

Sex, drugs and on the dole
Some men rise, some men fall

Keep my dogs fed, all jungle, all garage heads
Gold teeth, Valentinos and dreads now
We were verbally slapped up
Physically tip-top, spinally ripped up
I do the science on my laptop
And I get my boys mashed up
You're listening to The Streets
You'll bear witness to some amazing feats
Bravery in the face of defeat
All line up and grab your seat

My Underground train runs from Mile End to Ealing
From Brixton to Bounds Green
My spitting's dirty, my beats are clean
So smoke weed and be lean
I step out my yard through the streets
In the dead heat, all I got's my spirit and my beats
I play fair, don't cheat and keep the gangsters sweet
Turn the page, don't rip it out at your age, move to the next stage
Lock the rage inside the cage, like SK, it's a new day
But don't take the shortcut through the subway
It's pay or play, these geezers walk the gangway
Deep seated urban decay, deep seated urban decay
Rip down posters I like from last week's big garage night
And the next Tyson fight
I cook 'em at 90 degrees Fahrenheit and don't copy the copyright
I got 'em in my sights
Blinding with the lights, taken to dizzy new heights
Blinding with the lights, blinding with the lights
Dizzy new heights

In one single moment, your whole life can turn 'round
I stand there for a minute, staring straight into the ground
Looking to the left slightly, then looking back down
The world feels like it's caved in, proper sorry frown
Please let me show you how we could only just be for us
I can change and I can grow, or we could adjust
The wicked thing about us is we always have trust
We can even have an open relationship if you must
I look at her, she stares almost straight back at me
But her eyes glaze over like she's looking straight through me
Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity
When they open up, she's looking down at her feet

Dry your eyes, mate
I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes, mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over

So then I move my hand up from down by my side
Shaking, my life is crashing before my eyes
I turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies
Touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh
'Cause I can't imagine my life without you and me
There's things I can't imagine doing, things I can't imagine seeing
It weren't supposed to be easy, surely
Please, please, I beg you, please
She brings her hand up towards where my hands rested
She wraps her fingers 'round mine
With the softness she's blessed with
She peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gestures
By pushing my hand away to my chest, from hers
Dry your eyes, mate
I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes, mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over

And I'm just standing there
I can't say a word
'Cause everything's just gone
I've got nothing
Absolutely nothing

Trying to pull her close out of bare desperation
Put my arms around her, trying to change what she's saying
Pull my head level with hers, so she might engage and
Look into her eyes to make her listen again
I'm not gonna fuckin' just fuckin' leave it all now
'Cause you said it'd be forever and that was your vow
And you're gonna let our things simply crash and fall down?
You're well out of order now, this is well out of town
She pulls away my arms that tightly clamp around her waist
Gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight
Turns around so she's now got her back to my face
Takes one step forward, looks back, and then walks away
Dry your eyes, mate
I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes, mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over

I know in the past I've found it hard to say
Telling you things but not telling straight
But the more I pull on your hand and say
The more you pull away

Dry your eyes, mate
I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes, mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Turn left up the street
Nothing but grey concrete and deadbeats
Grab something to eat, Maccy D's or KFC?
Only one choice in the city, done voicing my pity

Now let's get to the nitty gritty
Tune reminds me of my first E
Plight unique, still sixteen and feeling horny
Point to the sky, feel free
A sea of people all equal, smiles in front and behind me
Swim in the deep blue sea, corn fields sway lazily
All smiles, all easy
"Where ya from, what's you on and what's your story?"
Mesmerising tones, rising pianos, this is my zone, so stop cloning
Pick paper, scissors or stone
'Cause me and you are the same
I've known you all my life, I don't know your name
The name's European Bob, sorted
Anyway, we'll have a dance now, see ya later
"Pleased to meet ya"; "Likewise, a pleasure"

We were just standing there, minding our own
We went on and on (We all smile, we all sing)
The weak become heroes and the stars align
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)
We were just standing there, minding our own
We went on and on (We all smile, we all sing)
The weak become heroes and the stars align
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)
The night slowly fades and goes slow motion
All the commotion becomes floating emotions
Same piano loops over
Arms wave, eyes roll back and jaws fall open
See in soft focus
Chatting to this bloke in the toilets
Dizzy new heights, blinded by the lights, these people are for life
It's all back to his place at the end of the night, yo
They could settle wars with this, if only they will
Imagine the world's leaders on pills
And imagine the morning after
Wars causing disaster
Don't talk to me, I don't know ya
But this ain't tomorrow, for now, I still love ya
Hours fly over
Sail 'round, diamonds and pearls
Never seen so many fit girls
Discover new worlds
Look at my watch, can't focus
Last two hours are lost
Every move fills me with lust
All of life's problems, I just shake off, yo
Mad little events happen
Things map out and a few blue maddens alight the toilets
Big beefy bouncers out to reveal us
Geezers on E's and first timers
Kids on wizz, darlings on Charlie
All comes together for this party
All races, many faces from places you've never heard of
"Where you from, what's your name and what you want?"
Sing to the words, flex to the fat ones
The tribal drums, the sun's rising
We all smile, we all sing
We were just standing there, minding our own
We went on and on (We all smile, we all sing)
The weak become heroes and the stars align
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)
We were just standing there, minding our own
We went on and on (We all smile, we all sing)
The weak become heroes and the stars align
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)

Then the girl in the café taps me on the shoulder
I realise five years went by and I'm older
Memories smoulder, winter's colder
But that same piano loops over and over and over
The road shines and the rain washes away
Same Chinese take-away selling shit in a tray
It's dark all 'round, I walk down
Same sights, same sounds, new beats, though
Solid concrete under my feet
No surprises, no treats
The world stands still as my mind slushes 'round
The washing-up bowl in my crown
My life's been up and down since I walked from that crowd

We were just standing there, minding our own
We went on and on (We all smile, we all sing)
The weak become heroes and the stars align
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)
We were just standing there, minding our own
We went on and on (We all smile, we all sing)
The weak become heroes and the stars align
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)
Out of respect for Johnny Walker, Paul Oakenfold
Nicky Holloway, Danny Rampling
And all the people who gave us these times
And to the government
I stick my middle finger up with regards to the Criminal Justice Bill
For all the heroes I met along the way
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)

The weak become heroes and the stars align
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)
We were just standing there, minding our own
We went on and on (We all smile, we all sing)
The weak become heroes and the stars align
(We all sing, we all sing, sing)1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

That's it, turn the page on the day, walk away
'Cause there's sense in what I say, I'm forty-fifth generation Roman
But I don't know 'em or care when I'm spitting
So return to your sitting position and listen, it's fitting
That I'm miles ahead and they chase me
Show your face on TV then we'll see, you can't do half
My crew laughs at your rhubarb-and-custard verses
You rain down curses, but I'm waving your hearses driving by
Streets riding high with the beats in the sky
All stare, eyes glazed, garage burnt down
The fire raged for forty days and in forty ways
But through the blaze, they see it fade
The sea of black, the beaming heat on their faces
Then a figure emerges from the wastage
Eyes transfixed with a piercing gaze
One hand clutching his sword, raised to the sky
They wonder how, they wonder why
The sky turns white, it all becomes clear
They felt lifted from their fears
They shed tears in the light after six dark years
Young bold soldiers, the fire burns, cracks and smoulders
Five years older and wiser
The fires are burning, on fire, never tire
Slay warriors in the forests and on higher, we sing
Hear the strings rising, the war's over, the bells ring
Memories fading, soldiers slaying, looks like geezers raving
The hazy fog over the Bullring, the lazy ways the birds sing
A new baby's born every day, few men may be scorned today
But look at things the other way
'Cause it may well be your final day
And then the crowds roar, they slay, they all say
I produced this using only my bare wit
Give me a jungle or garage beat and admit defeat
Use war and past injury as my metaphor and simile
Get all applications in to me before the deadline
'Cause it's a fine line between strifeful crimes and a life of crime
But you will reach the day
And it's all mine, you can take it or leave it
I shake and reveal stage tricks like Jimi Hendrix
In the afterlife, gladiators meet their maker
Float through the wheat fields and lakes of blue water
To the next life from the fortress
Away from the knives and slaughter
To their wives and daughters
Once more before the Lord judges over all of us
It's in this place you'll see me
Brace yourself, 'cause this goes deep
I'll show you the secrets, the sky and the birds
Actions speak louder than words
Stand by me, my apprentice
Be brave, clench fists5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

This ain't the down, it's the upbeat, make it complete
So what's the story? Guaranteed accuracy, enhanced CD
Latest technology, darts hit treble twenty
Huge non-recoupable advance, majors be vigilant
I excel in both content and deliverance
So let's put on our classics and we'll have a little dance, shall we?
No sales pitch, no media hype
No hydro, it's nice and ripe
I speak in communications in bold type
This ain't your archetypal street sound, scan for ultrasounds
North, south, east, west and all 'round
And then to the Underground

You say that everything sounds the same
Then you go buy them
There's no excuses, my friend
Let's push things forward
You say that everything sounds the same
Then you go buy them
There's no excuses, my friend
Let's push things forward

As we progress to the check point
I wholeheartedly agree with your viewpoint
But this ain't your typical garage joint
I make points which hold significance
That ain't a bag, it's a shipment
This ain't a track, it's a movement
I got the settlement
My frequencies are transient and resonate your eardrums
I make bangers, not anthems
Leave that to The Artful Dodger
The broad-shouldered fifty-one percent shareholder
You won't find us on Alta Vista
Cult classic, not bestseller
You're gonna need more power
Plug in the three-phase and the generator
Crank it up to the gigawatts
Critics, ready with your pot shots, the plot thickens
Put on your mittens for these sub-zero conditions
But remember I'm just spitting, remember I'm just spitting
Once bitten, forever smitten
You say that everything sounds the same
Then you go buy them
There's no excuses, my friend
Let's push things forward
You say that everything sounds the same
Then you go buy them
There's no excuses, my friend
Let's push things forward

Spit jewels like Eastern riches, junkie fixes
Around here, we say "birds", not "bitches"
As London Bridge burns down, Brixton's burning up
Turns out you're in luck, 'cause I know this dodgy fuck in the Duck
So it's just another show flick from your local city poet
In case you geezers don't know it, let's push things forward
It's a tall order but we're taller
Calling all maulers, back street brawlers
Corner shop crawlers, victory's flawless
Love us or hate us, but don't slate us
Don't conform to formulas, pop genres and such
Sharp darts, Double Dutch
Parked cars, troubles are much
With more bud – let's push things forward
You say that everything sounds the same
Then you go buy them
There's no excuses, my friend
Let's push things forward
You say that everything sounds the same
Then you go buy them
There's no excuses, my friend
Let's push things forward3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

A new day, another morning after
Leanin' back on my chair in a greasy spoon cafeteria
Last night was some beer-lairy-ness done our way
But again, we're back in the light of day
Chattin' shit, sittin' at the wall table, tellin' jokes
Playin' with the salt, looking out the window
Girl brings two plates of full English over
With plenty of scrambled eggs and plenty of fried tomato
Get my phone out, 'bout to give this girl a shout
See if she had a nice time last night uptown
Ask if she fancies tryin' it again some time
Then Calv grabs the phone like "Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!"

Hold it down, boy, your head's gettin' blurred
I know you can't stop thinkin' of her
By all means, you can vibe with this girl
But just don't mug yourself, that's all, don't mug yourself

Seriously Mick, you fucker
No, no, no! D'you know what I mean?
I'll fuckin', I'm no way, really, d'you know what I mean?
I'm fuckin'... I can take it or leave it, believe!
And then Calvin's like, "Oi!"
You need to hold it down, Jack, put your phone back
Quit starin' into space and eat your snack, that's that
She'll want you much more for not hangin' on
Stop me if I'm wrong, stop me if I'm wrong
Why should she be the one who decides
Whether it's off or on, or on, or off or on?
Now the girl's rude, I know she's rude
But she's screwed right through you, you'll be on your knees soon

Hold it down, boy, your head's gettin' blurred
I know you can't stop thinkin' of her
By all means, you can vibe with this girl
But just don't mug yourself, that's all, don't mug yourself

And I'm like
Honestly, it's not like that
You're actin' like I'm prancin' like a sap
Jumpin' when she claps and that
Oi, do you really think I act whack?
'Cause I'm telling ya
I'm servin' the aces and it's game, set and match
Perfectly in control of this goal
I've got the lead role
Won't be foldin', I'm older than you told
Girl sold, high speed's gold
Game over, game over, too cold
Hold it down, boy, your head's gettin' blurred
I know you can't stop thinkin' of her
By all means, you can vibe with this girl
But just don't mug yourself, that's all, don't mug yourself
Hold it down, boy, your head's gettin' blurred
I know you can't stop thinkin' of her
By all means, you can vibe with this girl
But just don't mug yourself, that's all, don't mug yourself

Oh-oh, yeah
Hold it down, boy, your head's gettin' blurred
I know you can't stop thinkin' of her
That girl is – she has smelly on her P's
She must have crab and fuckin' shrimp in her teeth
(No! Oh no, that's it, that's it)
Hold on, let me go again, let me go again
Are we, are we still recording?
Woah, yeah2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

'Cause this world swallows souls
And when the blues unfold, it gets cold, solids burns holes
You're going mad, perhaps you always were
But when things was good, you just didn't care
This is called irony
When you most need to get up, you got no energy
Time and time, shit'll happen, the dark shit's unwrapping
But no-one's listening, your mates are laughing
Your bredren's fucking and then you start hating
Your stomach starts churning and your mind starts turning
So smoke another draw
It won't matter no more, but the next day still feels sore
Rain taps on your window, always did though
But you didn't hear it when things was so-so
You're on your own now, your little zone
You were born alone and believe me, you'll die alone
Weed becomes a chore
You want the buzz back so you follow the others onto smack

Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Feels nice and still
Good thing about brown is it always will
It's easy, no-one blames you
It's that world out there that's fucked you
You're no less of a person and if God exists, He still loves you
Just remember that
The more you sink, the further back from that brink
Maybe you have lifetime scars
And you think tattoos might be more fitting, but who's picking?
Searching for yourself, you find demons
Try and be a free man and grasp that talisman
'Cause you're the same as I am
We all need our fellow man, we all need our Samaritan
Maybe I'm better looking than you, though
Maybe I've got more dough, but am I happier? No
Get the love of a good girl
And your world will be much richer than my world
And your happiness will uncurl

Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
"Stop dreaming"
People who say that are blaspheming
They're doing nine-to-five and moaning
And they don't want you succeeding when they've blown it
And your idols – who are they?
They, too, dreamt about their day
Positive steps will see your goals
Whether it's dollars or control, feel the gold
I ain't helping you climb the ladder, I'm busy climbing mine
That's how it's been since the dawn of time
If you reach a cul-de-sac, the world turns it's back
This is your zone, it's like blackjack
He might get the ace or the top one
So organise your twos and threes into a run
And then you'll have fucked him, son
And for that, you'll be the better one
One last thing before you go, though
When you feel better tomorrow, you'll be a hero
But never forget today
You could be back here, things can stray
But what if you see me in that window?
You won't help me, I know
That's cool, just keep walking where you go
Carry on through the estate
Stare at the geezers so they know you ain't lightweight
And go see your mates
And when they don't look happy
Play 'em this tape
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive
Just try and stay positive

I hope you understand me
I ain't no preaching fucker and I ain't no do-goody-goody either
This is about when shit goes pear-shaped
And if you aren't, or never have been at rock bottom
Then good luck to you in the big wide world
But remember that one day, shit might just start crumbling
Your bird might fuck off or you might lose your job
It's when that happens that what I'm talking about
Will feel much more important to you
So if you ain't feeling it
Just be thankful that things are cool in your world

If I want to sit in and drink Super Tennent's in the day, I will
No one's gonna fuckin' tell me jack
But can you rely on anyone in this world? No, you can't
It's not my fault there's wall-to-wall empty cans
Everyone wanted this to all go wrong for me from the start
It's fucked up that a man's life can just be attacked
Watching This Morning with a beer is much better than relying on
Known cunts for mates I was given that don't have my back
Scott texted me to say he'd have a look at the TV for me
But I laid it down, telling him to fuck right off, chap
Phoned this company out the Yellow Pages
Told them to take away the TV, fix it quick snap
The next day they took away the TV
Told me they would repair the little bit
That's broken 'round on the back
I thought that'd be that, but the next bit was on top
This was where it all started to get a bit out of hand

No one gives a crap about Mike
That's why I'm acting nasty
You know what you can do with your life?
Introduce it up your jacksie
'Cause no one gives a crap about Mike
That's why I'm acting nasty
You know what you can do with your life
Introduce it up your jacksie
The TV man comes back later, knocks on mine
To say he's found something in the back of the TV
I'm looking at it absolutely speechless
Can't quite believe he's trying to pull this fucking stunt on me
I knew it was a simple case of the power supply gone on the back
But he's trying to tap me up for more money
He says, "It's not like that," and I'm like, "Fuck off and die"
And stick up my two fingers and one more to make three
And he says, "Don't talk to me like that," and "I don't understand"
My face is in his face, I tell him I understand perfectly
And he grabs my shirt and I grab his face with my hand
So he brings his fist up and twats me a good one on my cheek
Then I'm trying to pull his head down
So I can knee it, but he's got my ear
He's twisting it 'round so much it's really hurting me
And we both go down on the floor, and he pushes my head
Back onto the corner of the fridge, which is total agony
Then he gets up and runs out of the kitchen and out of the door
Shouting stuff to me, slams his door, shouting to me
So here I am in my house, drinking on my own settee
Everyone's a cunt in this life, no one's there for me

No one gives a crap about Mike
That's why I'm acting nasty
You know what you can do with your life?
Introduce it up your jacksie
'Cause no one gives a crap about Mike
That's why I'm acting nasty
You know what you can do with your life
Introduce it up your jacksie
(*sound of a rewinding tape*)

If I want to sit in and drink Super Tennent's in the day, I will
No one's gonna fuckin' tell me jack
But can you rely on anyone in this world? No, you can't
It's all my fault there's wall-to-wall empty cans
I sat in the kitchen, all fucked off
Imagining over and over what they were all doing behind my back
Dodgy things going on, actions I regretted
Stain bottle with a pipe and tin foil on the mat
Scott texted me to say he'd have a look at the TV for me
And I felt like just telling him to fuck right off, chap
But what he said about wanting to do
The right thing by both mates
And then opting to stay out? It seemed to match
But I told him he could make it up by fixing the TV
He said that's the least he could do to square things flat
I thought that'd be that, but then the next bit was mad
This is where everything started to all turn back

It's the end of something I did not want to end
Beginning of hard times to come
But something that was not meant to be is done
And this is the start of what was
He had to unscrew about fifteen screws
Before he could pull the panel off the back
To get in the fecking thing
But just as he did so, he said he saw summat
That slipped inside behind the panel down the back of it
Must have been some leaflets or a bill maybe
I didn't wanna lose the bill in case it was a final warning
So we both tried to get the back off and work out
If there were any more screws to get out or if we left any in
And when he looked down the back of the TV, his eyes just froze
Before he rammed his hand in, saying, "No shit!"
He's looking at me absolutely speechless
He can't quite believe what he's trying to pull out the slit
I get up, wondering what he's smiling about
He's shaking his head at this point with the biggest of grins
I look down the back of the TV and that's where it was
In all its glory: my thousand quid

It's the end of something I did not want to end
Beginning of hard times to come
But something that was not meant to be is done
And this is the start of what was

About two this afternoon, the last of the people left my house
'Cause they never stop chatting 'til all the racket's gone
I really feel like things clicked into place at some point
Or maybe it's the fact that me and Alison really got on
Or maybe it's that I realised that it is true
No-one's really there fighting for you in the last garrison
No-one except yourself that is, no-one except you
You are the one who's got your back 'til the last deed's done
Scott can't have my back 'til the absolute end
'Cause he's got to look out for what over his horizon
He's gotta make sure he's not lonely, not broke
It's enough to worry about keeping his own head above
I shut the door behind me, huddled up in my coat
Condensation floating off my breath, squinted out the sun
My jeans felt a bit tight, I think I washed them too high
I was gonna be late, so I picked up my pace to run

It's the end of something I did not want to end
Beginning of hard times to come
But something that was not meant to be is done
And this is the start of what was
It's the end of something I did not want to end
Beginning of hard times to come
But something that was not meant to be is done
And this is the start of what was
It's the end of something I did not want to end
Beginning of hard times to come

Hello, hello
My name's Terry and I'm a law-abider
There's nothing I like more than getting fired up on beer
And when the weekend's here
I exercise my right to get paralytic and fight
Good bloke, fairly
But I get well lairy when geezers look at me funny
Bounce 'em round like bunnies
I'm likely to cause mischief
Good clean grief, you must believe, and I ain't no thief
Law-abiding and all, all legal
And who cares about my liver when it feels good?
What you need is some real manhood
Rasher Rasher, Barney and Kasha, putting peoples' backs up
Public disorder? I'll give you public disorder!
I down eight pints and run all over the place
Spit in the face of an officer
See if that bothers ya, 'cause I never broke a law in my life
Someday, I'm gonna settle down with a wife
Come on, lads, let's have another fight

Er, hello, my name's Tim and I'm a criminal
In the eyes of society, I need to be in jail
For the choice of herbs I inhale
This ain't no wholesale operation
Just a few eighths and some PlayStation's my vocation
I pose a threat to the nation
And down the station, the police hold no patience
Let's talk space and time
I like to get deep sometimes and think about Einstein
And Carl Jung, and old Kung Fu movies I like to see
Pass the hydrator please
Yeah, I'm floating on thin air
Going to Amsterdam in the New Year, top gear there
'Cause I take pride in my hobby
Homemade bongs using my engineering degree
Dear leaders, please legalise weed for these reasons
Like I was saying to him
I told him, "Fuck with me and you won't live"
So I smacked him in the head and downed another Carling
Bada-bada-bing, for the lads like
Mad fight, his face's a sad sight, vodka and snakebite
Going on like a right geez, he's a twat
Shouldn't have looked at me like that
Anyway, I'm an upstanding citizen
If a war came along, I'd be on the front line with 'em
Can't stand crime either, them hooligans on heroin
Drugs and criminals
Those thugs are the pinnacle of the downfall of society
I've got all the anger pent up inside of me

You know, I don't see why I should be the criminal
How can something with no recorded fatalities be illegal?
And how many deaths are there per year from alcohol?
I just completed Gran Turismo on the hardest setting
We pose no threat on my settee
Ooh, the pizza's here, will someone let him in, please?
"We didn't order chicken
Not a problem, we'll pick it out"
I doubt they meant to mess us about
After all, we're all adults, not louts
As I was saying, we're friendly, peaceful people
We're not the ones out there causing trouble
We just sit in this hazy bubble with our quarters
Discussing how beautiful Gail Porter is
MTV, BBC Two, Channel 4 is on 'til six in the morning
Then at six in the morning, the sun dawns and it's my bed time
Causing trouble? You're stinking rabble!
Poised, saying I'm the lad who's spoiling it? You're on drugs!
It really bugs me when people try and tell me I'm a thug
Just for getting drunk
I like getting drunk
'Cause I'm an upstanding citizen
If a war came along, I'd be on the front line with 'em

Now Terry, you're repeating yourself
But that's okay, drunk people can't help that
A chemical reaction happening inside your brain
Causes you to forget what you're saying

What?! I know exactly what I'm saying
I'm perfectly sane
You stinking student lame-o!
Go get a job and stop robbing us of our taxes

Erm, well, actually, according to research
Government funding for further education pales in insignificance
When compared to how much they spend on repairing
Lairy drunk people at the weekend
In casualty wards all over the land
Why, you cheeky little swine, come here!
I'm gonna batter ya! Come here!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense

Out the club about three, to the takeaway
The shit-in-a-tray merchants
Shop's got special perchant for the disorderly
Geezers looking ordinary and a few looking lairy
Chips fly 'round to the sound of the latest chart entry
An incendiary, waiting to blast
No harm with a contest who can throw the furthest
Behind the counter they look nervous
But carry on cutting the finest cuts of chicken
From the big spinning stick
Then over flies a chip, flips and hits you on the back
You spin 'round on the attack, "Fuck you playin' at?"
He looks like a Cheshire cat, almost falls down
Your frowns and Superman eye-lasers don't even register
By now, you wanna level this twat
And forever you're gonna regret that, your choice of path
So mash his head up and your girl's now fed up
But stop to think and it's never going to be the Jackie Chan scene
It could've been to end up
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense

So you owe someone money subbin' scunny
Best pay me, Billy, "No worries"
One-fifty on Sunday, then in some way, that turns into Wednesday
Then goes straight to pay on a hazy evening in the local bar-café
What a way! What a way!
Just to recap for those at the back, this is everyday tit-for-tat
You owe your dealer and can't pay him back fee
Suddenly, he's the baddy
So you tell your mates you could have him anyway, to look geez
But he's a shady fuck, Beamer three series
Lock, stock and two fat fucks backin' him up
Can't convey enough of his desire for the paper stuff
In a blunt fashion, Billy's angry with a passion
So please just accept it ain't happenin'
And go back to your runnins
'Cause you might get yourself in trouble one of these days
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense

Get a hold of this bird after pub closing hours
Would your girl like this? No, don't think so somehow
In the winter showers
But she'll never know and your face will never show shit
This is how goes it, besides she was well fit, and who could resist?
Move up to the next place, it's a smooth club
Flex, bass, beats, and your best mates
All down, nice sound, Smirnoff Ice rounds
MCs clowning, rudeboys frowning, everything's sweet
Everything's tucked in, and 'round here, we're all downing
But all of a sudden though, just through the smoke
It's your bird laughing and joking with a bloke
Ain't just that either, as she moves closer
In a shape what looks like they're lovers, he's tonguing her!
All rage sweeps up through your torso
You're more so ready to go over and show him who's man
Football fan style, leave it in the can for awhile
'Cause even as they smile, he's still got choices
Don't listen to them voices
That at the end of the day you may just have caused this
So leave the forces
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense
Geezers need excitement
If their lives don't provide 'em this, they incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She said, "Meet me at the gates at eight
Leave now, don't be late"
She said one day she'd walk away 'cause I was always late
Thought things were okay
Didn't care though anyway
Say, "Sorry, babe, I had to meet a mate", tempting fate
We first met through a shared view, she loved me and I did too
It's now 7:50, getting ready, better be nifty
Do my hair quickly; step out, it's cloudy
Mate bells me to borrow money
I got two Henry's and a dealer to pay
Call up on geezers to rid these green trees of my reeking jeans
Got a "You think I care?" air, out-glaring geezers' stares
I'm here and I'm there
Couldn't see past the end of my beer
What was getting near all the silence after the cheers

I didn't know that it was over
'Til it was too late (Too late)
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?

She said, "Meet me at the gates
Don't be late"
But pretty soon, the day came for change
And I was glad she never walked away
So I'm choosing what to wear
Doing my hair with an hour to spare
When my life went pear, she'd been there with a thick stare
Big wheel climbed to the top
Geezer stares bounced off
Standing at the top of this huge mountain
Smiling and shouting, spring flowers sprouting
Not one inch of doubt in my mind as I reached the gates
Came 'round the corner at a rate
Risked her love, but I was gonna set things straight
Never again am I gonna be late
Never again am I gonna be late
Never again am I gonna be late
I didn't know that it was over
'Til it was too late (Too late)
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?

I said, "Meet me at the gates
Leave now, don't be late"
I waited for a while listening to her voicemail, mind set sail
Then the facts turned me pale
Wind, rain and hail
My fears unveiled for my fair female
She'd walked away; too little, too late
I step up the pace, walk past the gates, rain runs over my face
Spirit falls from grace
I purchase a hazy escape at the alcohol place in the Chase
Sat down, got a fat frown
Weeping and drowning my senses
For this love game's expensive
I walk in a trance
Got a wounded soldier's stance
And the everyday geezers' stares throw me off balance
Now nothing holds significance
And nothing holds relevance
'Cause the only thing I can see is her elegance
I didn't know that it was over
'Til it was too late (Too late)
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?
I didn't know that it was over
'Til it was too late (Too late)
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Smell of good earthy herbs makes my nerves shudder
But where were you that cold December?
'Cause we were in the Grasshopper, spending Guilders
Centraal Station, charged up like Scarface
Amsterdam ain't a nice place off your face, we enter the race
Walk down, been there before, done that, no joy if you're bored
Let's go see Roy and get fucked up with the boys
Calvin, Schmalvin, I'm well within my limit
Oh, hang on a minute, these mushrooms just kicked in
Think I might be finished
The ball game heads for the worst
For what it's worth, I might just fall off the edge of the earth
Brain's kind of surfing now
We wandered down darkened pathways in a daze (Woy!)
"Do you want to buy any cocaine, boy?"
Am I paranoid? "Yes, you're paranoid!"
Charlie, darling, please save me
This is raving, take me home to my baby
Two bags of mushrooms, room's mushed up and I need a cradle

In its own little way, my body was trying to say
That you'd better stop drinking brandy
In its own little way, my body was trying to say
That you'd better stop drinking brandy
Now getting to the bar's gonna be trouble
So the Marlons'll have to be doubles
Then you drink doubles the same speed you drink singles
Ahh, beautiful, the barman holds aloft the crystal glass
And I'm having all that's in the bubble in the bottom of the bottle
Then by 3:00 or 4:00, your head's a bit mangled
Club's full, you mingle, you dance the fandango
You sing all your favourite jingles
Far gone on one, call me Baron Von Marlon
One has a monocle and cigar, dickie-bow and long johns
My utility belt tells me it's to the bar, Batman
Fat cans of that lager then it's straight to the dancefloor
For much more fancy footwork, it's adored by many, amour
Don't bore me with your little sidestep technique
Get to the beat, loosen up, it's The Streets

In its own little way, my body was trying to say
That you'd better stop drinking brandy
In its own little way, my body was trying to say
That you'd better stop drinking brandy

We eat junk food, sat drunk on the Tube
Every time the train clunks, I feel like puking
Wonder whether that beautiful bird'll ring?
Then it all goes hazy, these are the days we walking up out, in
Back to the road, talking, well, shouting actually
Loads more drunk, by Jove, my mind's focused, balance fucked up
Rah, rah, rah, it's all back to the Dogstar
And if it's his round, I'm quite partial to another Marlon at the bar
Bad idea to start again late, should've given my brain a break
Take it easy, mate, you start to think you're a state
You definitely are a state
In its own little way, my body was trying to say
That you'd better stop drinking brandy
In its own little way, my body was trying to say

'Cause her last relationship fucked her up
Got hurt majorly, finds it tough to trust
Looked at the ashtray, then looked back up
Spinning it away on the tabletop
She looked much fitter than Saturday, just
She worked in JD's with Dan
Back then I figured she was pretty damn rough
But she was only wearing her work stuff
And in these clothes, she looked more than buff
She stirred her straw, sat up to adjust
I told her I thought it was important
That you could get lost in conversation
Chatting shit, sitting in oblivion
With that person who's your special one
She said she was the worst pool player under the sun
But blokes go easy, so she always won

I saw this thing on ITV the other week
Said that if she played with her hair, she's probably keen
She's playing with her hair well regularly
So I reckon I could well be in

She didn't look too bored with what I was saying
Her hair looked much better than the other day
She had her fingers 'round her hair, playing
I saw on the telly that's a good indication
She didn't offer to buy the next drink though, nay
But I suppose that's just our girl's way
I'm trying to think what else I could say
Peeling the label off, spinning the ashtray
Yeah, actually, yeah, she did look pretty neat
Her perfume smelled expensive and sweet
But I felt like my hair looked a bit cheap
I wished I'd had it cut back last week
She kept giving me this look as she would speak
Was she only friendly, or was she a keep?
Asked her if she wanted the same again to drink
Just started to turn and get up out my seat
I saw this thing on ITV the other week
Said that if she played with her hair, she's probably keen
She's playing with her hair well regularly
So I reckon I could well be in

She said that her close mates all were
Always the most important thing to her
I said I thought it was a bit more blurred
She asked what I meant by that as she stirred
I told her about the money and what had occurred
With it going missing from the living room side
With my best mates all there standing by
Right where I left it, under their eyes
So surely one of them might have spied
What happened to my money at that time
I felt like they were all smiling on the side
She was like, "Fair play", she couldn't say why
She didn't know what all my mates were like
And I said she just might be right
Wish I had someone I could always rely
Someone to get lost chatting to all night

I saw this thing on ITV the other week
Said that if she played with her hair, she's probably keen
She's playing with her hair well regularly
So I reckon I could well be in
As I walked back with more drinks to our place
She had her phone stuck to the side of her face
I sat for a minute while she chatted away
'Bout something with her mum and her birthday
Played for a bit with the same ashtray
Thought about things while I sat and waited
It was nice to chat about the shit in my head
Someone who just listens to you instead
I looked at the barman, wiping down again
Looked at the football on the TV set
Trying to look like I weren't just waiting there
For her conversation to come to an end
I looked at my watch and realised right then
That for three hours, been in conversation
Before she put her phone down, she switched to silent
And we carried on chatting for more than that again

I saw this thing on ITV the other week
Said that if she played with her hair, she's probably keen
She's playing with her hair well regularly
So I reckon I could well be in

It’s not the size of the dog in the fight but the fight in the dog
Let surprise take a slog
And if you get a knife from behind, know you’re nice and in front
(Do it, do it)
I wouldn’t say a word 'til I’ve walked a mile in your shoes
But once a mile from you
I’ll utter what the fuck I choose, and wearing nice new shoes
(Do it, do it)

If you’re going through hell
If you’re going through hell
If you’re going through hell
If you’re going through hell, keep going

Fall down five times, rise up six
Give the good news by way of fists
The mind plays tricks on the fighter who wishes
Kindness is right and both sides win (Yeah, yeah)
Push the limits of stubbornness to
Finish up above the stubbornness of silly limits (Yeah)
Run the ring around your finger
And build the ring around to bring it, bring it
If you’re going through hell
If you’re going through hell
If you’re going through hell
If you’re going through hell, keep going

If you can’t join them, beat them
If you won’t ‘roid up, be friends
The joy of the fight is the fight in the boy
I’m making this up now, finding a point
Is it "If you can’t win, then run"?
The coming to fists is the fun of the thing
It’s all just lads and the normal ambiance
Fall or stab and then call an ambulance

I can resist anything (Who said that?)
But temptation
Lead me not into that place
I can find it myself
I can resist anything (Who's with me?)
But temptation
Lead me not into that place
I can find it myself
(Found it)
Your hero is only ordinary
Is just a hero, a moment more than you and me
You have nothing to lose, but your chains
So it maybe might rain
And yeah, maybe slight pain
Or a daylight slaying
(Do it, do it)
At the end of the tunnel, there is always light
It just might be a train
(Beefy!)

Yeah, yeah
Uh
Yeah
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah

I should be standing at the bar waving a ten pound note around
But I sit here on the sofa at my girl's house
I should be chatting shit as I'm nubbing out another snout
But I'll roach a spliff watching the TV for now
I should be watching the fruit machines for which one will pay out
But I sit on the sofa at my girl's, anyhow
I should be legging it from a cab like a mad little lout
But I'll roach a spliff watching the TV, throughout

I know I never tell her but every single day, man
I'm always thinking loads about her
She's the best thing that ever happened to me and
I don't know what I'd do without her

I should actually go out and about, flip some beer mats
Instead of sitting here at my girl's gaff (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause all I seem to do is sit in this habitat
Just roaching a spliff, watching the TV and that
And the TV at my house is a bit broken on the back
So I use my girl's TV to watch the match (Oh)
Yeah, I might head out later to get off this beaten track
Of watching the TV, roaching up, on the same old mat
I know I never tell her but every single day, man
I'm always thinking loads about her
She's the best thing that ever happened to me and
I don't know what I'd do without her

But on second thoughts, I won't do shots
No, I think I will sit on the sofa and eat my TV meal
I would actually much prefer to just sit here and chill (Ooh)
Roaching a spliff watching EastEnders or The Bill (Oh)
'Cause basically I love her, and I love being here still
And I love sitting on the sofa with my girl, for real (Yeah)
I don't want to knock my mates
But there, it's the same old drill
Roaching a spliff, watching the TV is my will (Ooh)

I know I never tell her but every single day, man (Oh, oh, oh)
I'm always thinking loads about her (Oh, oh)
She's the best thing that ever happened to me and
I don't know what I'd do without her (Oh, babe)

No, fuck that
I might ask my mates where they'll be drinking
From the sofa, giving them a ding
Tell 'em I will go threes on that gram later on this evening (Yeah)
Instead of roaching a spliff, watching the TV again
And then go out, whilst back at hers, she does her ting
Sitting on the sofa at her end
But as I watch the big screen, I know I will quite miss
Me and her roaching a spliff (Oh yeah), watching the TV again
I know I never tell her but every single day, man
I'm always thinking loads about her (Oh yeah)
(That's exactly what I'm talking about)
She's the best thing that ever happened to me
(I wouldn't have it any other way)
And I don't know what I'd do without her (Oh)
(I'll tell you this)
I know I never tell her
(There's a whole world out there)
But every single day, man
(A whole world)
I'm always thinking loads about her
(But do I give a–?)
She's the best thing that ever happened to me
(D'you know what I mean?)
And I don't know what I'd do without her
(There's a whole world out there)

I've got one packet of Rizla over there
But it's nearly run out
I've got bits of cigarette all over the place, mm-mm
The clipper needs a shake
The ashtray needs emptying
But I wouldn't have it any other way
I said, I wouldn't have it any other way
I said, I wouldn't have it any other way
Ooh, ooh, ooh
No, I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't
I wouldn't have it any other way
I said, the ashtray needs emptying
I said, the clipper needs a shake
But I wouldn't have it any other way
I did the same things as yesterday
Oh, oh, oh, I...
Oh, I wouldn't have it any other wayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

This is my hour, I'm never going to bed
The sky is still black, but begs to be red
I just put my book down, but it begs to be read
I'll not nod, I'll not nap, I never rest my head
Some days I feel I'm getting smaller and smaller
But some nights, I seem to grow taller and taller
And we keep shrinking and shrinking, but this will not finish
You're never nothing if you didn't disappear
Just when I discover the meaning of life, they change it
Just when I'm loving life, it seems to start raining
I pull the sail safe switch, seas settle, and I'm aimed at stars
I love the rain on my scars
The sky's now red, my eyes reflect jest
Smiling at this blessing, this life is the best

I came to this world with nothing
And I leave with nothing but love
Everything else is just borrowed

I wanna notice chances I've passed without notice
I wanna see details previously veiled
I wanna grab that chance, carry it home
So I can marry and know
That I noticed every chance
I could've passed without notice
I saw details that to all were veiled
And I grabbed those chances, carried them home
And then I'll have had it with roaming
I came to this world with nothing
And I leave with nothing but love
Everything else is just borrowed

I want to speak every cliché but tweak if I see change
In a new way it could be said
If it's bleak, or if the week's leaking down the street
Or if any day is wasted, I wanna face facts
My time on this earth is my only penny
Wise is the gent counting every moment spent
I don't want to explain things, don't want to fill in the gaps
I want to look at my friends and in that minute be at

Memories are times we borrow
For spending tomorrow
Memories are times we borrow
For spending tomorrow

I came to this world with nothing
And I leave with nothing but love
Everything else is just borrowed
It's a bit like luck: you can only seem
To borrow it, you can't keep it
When the wind of change whistles into play
Will I blink or flinch away?
The wind of change won't whistle me away
If I spin my tails and sail
And sail away, and let yesterday become today

I came to this world with nothing
And I leave with nothing but love
Everything else is just borrowed

As time will say nothing but
"I told you so"

Memories are times we borrow
For spending tomorrowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It was supposed to be so easy

Just take back the DVD
Withdraw that extra money
Tell Mum I wouldn't be back for tea
Then grab my savings and hurry
So first to get the film back in time
To avoid that big fine
I had to do a fast hill climb but I fasted the climb
But I flew a bit quick, arms like a lunatic
I had to stop for a few ticks
I started feeling sick
Got to the video shop in a state
But chuffed it wouldn't be late
Only when he flicked open the case
I'd left the disc at my place

Today I have achieved absolutely nowt
In just being out of the house, I've lost out
If I wanted to end up with more now
I should have just stayed in bed like I know how

So I failed on the DVD
But I still had to get the money
Tell Mum I couldn't make tea
Get the savings and then hurry
Rushin' to the cash machine
Still a bit mashed and lean
Then of course a mandatory car
Drives by and splashes me
Get there the queue's outrageous
Ladies taking ages
My rage is blowing gauges
How long's it take to validate your wages?
At last my turn comes
Press the fifty squid button: insufficient funds
Today I have achieved absolutely nowt
In just being out of the house, I've lost out
If I wanted to end up with more now
I should have just stayed in bed like I know how

So I failed on the DVD
Couldn't withdraw any money
But I still had to call Mum
Get the savings, and then hurry
So to call my mum so that
I could tell her I can't go and that
At least I remembered my phone, man
I didn't know her number offhand
Where's my phone, have I got it?
Oh, this is a crock of shit!
I lost the fucking thing!
Oh, here it is in my pocket
But the battery's nearly flat
Gotta call, quick snap
Aw, shit, the battery is flat

Today I have achieved absolutely nowt
In just being out of the house, I've lost out
If I wanted to end up with more now
I should have just stayed in bed like I know how
So I've failed on the DVD
Couldn't withdraw any money
Or call Mum about tea
I'll have to get the savings and hurry
But where was the money?
I knew I'd left it on the
Side, next to the telly
This is not even funny
I left it in the living room
Ready to pick up as soon
As I passed through
On the way out to the rendezvous
So the shoebox full of money
Just disappearing from me
Was not what I call funny
A grand don't come for free

Today I have achieved absolutely nowt
In just being out of the house, I've lost out
If I wanted to end up with more now
I should have just stayed in bed like I know how

Oi, soaked to the bone in me jeans
Do you want me to stop?
I imagine my mum's weeping right now
And the thousand pounds you swore
That I left on the table this morn
Has simply disappeared right before
My eyes, his eyes, and yours
And I'm a thousand pound poorer
Hundred thousand pennies, no more
A thousandth of a million squid or two monkeys
Or a whole fifty scores
Gone, withdrawn from my life
The money is no more for sure
It was supposed to be so easy1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah, street level
Oi, oi, yeah, that's it, right there

'Round here, nothing seems to change (At street level)
Same old thing every day (That's it, that's it, that's it)
Just gets played and replayed in different ways
(Yeah, oi, tune's heavy)
'Round here, nothing seems to change (At street level)
Same old thing every day (That's it, that's it, that's it)
Just gets played and replayed in different ways
(Yeah, oi, oi, right there)

Whose round is it?
Down that beer quick, smash my glass back down
Fall over the table, all rowdy and pissed
Seems the only difference between midweek shit
And weekend is how loud I speak
And whether I try and pull a girlfriend
That's it, who's got dough?
Hey, you know I'd pay but I'm broke, only got coinage to show
Putting off walking home on my own to my throne
Two empty takeaways, ashtrays, the remains of the day stoned
Pick a bottle off the table, peel the label, tell a fable
Offer opinion for free on a solution to the latest big news story
"Football and Smut Daily" as I ponder winning the lottery
Buy a drink, chat to a lady, the girl's well fit
Definitely, not maybe, she's rude
I'd shag her and make tea, right there
'Round here, nothing seems to change (At street level)
Same old thing every day (That's it, that's it, that's it)
Just gets played and replayed in different ways
(Yeah, oi, oi, heavy, heavy)
'Round here, nothing seems to change (At street level)
Same old thing every day (That's it, that's it, that's it)
Just gets played and replayed in different ways
(Yeah, oi, oi)

Can't lounge in the boozer all day, got manoeuvres to make
Gotta see a man about a dog, can't be late, I'm always late
Raining cats and fog but nice and dry in the Black Dog
Down it in one, my son
Can't sit here, gotta run, things need done
If they don't win this and the next one
They're getting relegated to the third division
At street level, real people, same repeated sequel
Rock and roll, four to the floor
Like last night, yesterday morning
And the night before, and the night before

Apparently there's a whole world out there somewhere
(It's right there)
I just don't see it (Right there)
I just don't see it (Oi, oi)
'Round here, nothing seems to change (At street level)
Same old thing every day (That's it, that's it, that's it)
Just gets played and replayed in different ways
(Yeah, oi, street level)
'Round here, nothing seems to change (At street level)

Lock the door on your way out1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
