And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a fat-ass crib with thousands of kids

Living in the effin' lap of luxury

Basically
Can't fuck with me

I came to bring the pain hardcore from the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
Find out my mental, based on instrumental
Records, hey, so I can write monumental
Methods, I'm not the king
But niggas is decaf, I stick 'em for the cream
Check it, just how deep can shit get
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad, fish accept it
In your Cross Colour clothes, you've crossed over
Then got Totally Krossed Out and Kris Krossed
Who the boss? Niggas get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan
I be hectic, and comin' for the head piece, protect it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket
Niggas want the ruckus
Bustin' at me, bruh, now bust it
Styles, I gets buckwild
Method Man on some shit, pullin' niggas files, I'm sick
Insane, crazy, driving Miss Daisy
Out her fucking mind, now I got mine, I'm Swayze
Is it real, son, is it really real, son?
Let me know it's real, son, if it's really real
Something I could feel, son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal, son, if it's really real, yeah, uh

When I was a likle stereo (Stereo)
I listen to some Champion (Champion)
I always wondered (Wondered)
When I will be di number one (Tical)
And now yuh listen to di Gorgon (Gorgon)
And a Gorgon sound a Rein
An' any jump and come tes' mi (Test me)
Mi a-go lick out dem brain (itâ€™s like that)

Brothers wanna hang with the Meth, bring the rope
The only way you'll hang is by the neck
Nigga, bolt off the set, comin' to your projects
Take it as a threat, better yet it's a promise
Comin' from a vet on some old Vietnam shit
Nigga, you can bet your bottom dollar, hey, I bomb shit
And it's gonna get even worse, word to God
It's the Wu comin' through, stickin' niggas for they garments
Movin' on your left, southpaw, Mr. Meth
Came to represent and carve my name in your chest
You can come test, realize you're no contest
Son, I'm the gun that won that old Wild West
Quick on the draw with my hands on the four-
Nine-three-eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it, 'cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof
Huh, vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me, ayy, give it to me raw
I've learned that when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a ho
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay the roll
What, basically that, Meth-Tical, '94 style (Northern spicy brown mustard hoes, word up, we be hazardous)
We have to stick you

Is it real, son, is it really real, son? (Motherfucker, I'll fuckin')
Let me know it's real, son, if it's really real (Slide you down a rusty razor blade into a pool of alcohol)
Something I could feel, son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal, son, if it's really real

I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin' cut your kneecaps off
And make you kneel at some staircase, piss
I'll fuckin' cut your eyelids off and feed you nothin' but sleepin' pills
Get yours, motherfucker
So fuck the ho, fuck the ho25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Sort of like Malcolm at the Audubon
They coming for me, time is money no Audemar
See bar-for-bar, I keep it pushing no R&R
No foreign broads and no promotion for foreign cars
The game is ours, letâ€™s keep it funky who said he was
Like Staten Island, Italians bleed spaghetti sauce
If y'all ain't shaking or stacking than y'all already lost
Already cross the light, Christ I'm ready for em
Plus anybody that saying no, Iâ€™m taking numbers
Iâ€™m taking names, Iâ€™ll take your chain take this hunger
Pain, pain, pain
Then you feel the thunder and rain I donâ€™t talk it like the rainbow
I get it done and the game yâ€™all
Do me a favor, donâ€™t ever play with my ball
Never been a player-hater I just ain't playing with y'all
You watching lame but look Iâ€™m taking the charge
Going hard will get you two shots now Iâ€™m facing the charge

Fire up the la letâ€™s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if youâ€™re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess Iâ€™ll see you when you wake up on the other side
Fire up the la letâ€™s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if youâ€™re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess Iâ€™ll see you when you wake up on the other side
Sort of like Mike at the United Center
Madison Square, Boston Garden I straight ignite on niggas
Lil' nigga your raps ainâ€™t no fire, that shitâ€™ll collapse so donâ€™t try
I scribble and scratch down in my pad that no lie
That no fake, that uncut, that straight drop, what the fuck
Iâ€™m pulled over by the jakes, a twenty-eight up in my nuts
For em took away in cuffs Iâ€™d rather lay up in the dust
Feel like fuck a friend a hundred million haters ainâ€™t enough
Twist it up
Life is a blunt and the world is my ash tray
I got them quarters and them halves just meet me like halfway
And I need a hundred percent of my profit ain't fucking with half pay
Ain't taking no shorts or losses bitch we ain't fronting no tag day
As I can recollect, praying to God this dopeâ€™ll stretch
Turn mobster warners, work these corners like P90X
Chilling and waiting, patient retaliation just ain't find me yet
Iâ€™ll take it into Heaven, you couldnâ€™t buy me that, remind me that

Fire up the la letâ€™s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if youâ€™re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess Iâ€™ll see you when you wake up on the other side
Fire up the la letâ€™s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if youâ€™re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess Iâ€™ll see you when you wake up on the other side
It's the worldâ€™s worst, quick to snatch your man purse
And leave your body head first in the stretched hearse
Murder she wrote, Iâ€™m known to spit a killer verse
And leave a player blood spilling on his linen shirt
You can Google my name but you ain't gotta search
Iâ€™m right here in the streets, I'm putting in work
Go ahead, fuck around and get your feelings hurt
Or, you can get carried outta your local church
Iâ€™m from the old school, I do my own dirt
Mama raised no fool, I did my own work
Keep your wifey close, sheâ€™s a little flirt
I knew her since '03, I hit the bitch first
Iâ€™m the reason why your baby mama water burst
Iâ€™ve been marvelous since birth, you can ask my Earth
Itâ€™s not a problem to show you how the shotty work
I put your body in the dirt, but what the dollars worth

Fire up the la letâ€™s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if youâ€™re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess Iâ€™ll see you when you wake up on the other side
Fire up the la letâ€™s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if youâ€™re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess Iâ€™ll see you when you wake up on the other side2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Jet back to the lab like they were being chased by homicide

And it will never steer you wrong
And all you bitch-ass niggas in the industry
Your careers won't be lasting long

Check it, I'm the fucking man, who they mention
Noticed that other niggas rap styles is bogus
Doo-doo compared to this versatile voodoo
Blazing, the stuff that ignites stimulation
Inside ya, cause I be that hell sure provider
Providing the rhyme that be deep as The Poseidon Adventure
Niggas need to test they freaking tincture
For the sickness that be spreading with the quickness
Remedies, cousin I be doing on my enemy
Penalty, then I drink forties to they memories
Emotion, coursing through your town street vicinity
Blunt smoke in the air reveals my identity

(Tical.... tical... ti-cal, ti-cal...)
As I keep it moving, we keep it moving, uh
Keep it moving, and keep it moving, uh
Keep it moving, baby, we be moving, uh

Party people getting down
When it hit no doubt about
Just release yo' delf

My God, somebody said, it's onâ€”if it is, then I'll be set
To blow a nigga up with my five fingers of death
I bring it to his whole damn fam, understand if you fronting
On any man down with the Clan, I be coming
For the headpiece you can't cope
For my brother, I bring it to the Pope, word to mother
Serial killer style from the Isles of Stat'
My peoples are you with me, where you at?
Shit's getting deep in here, I mean like thick
Niggas lookin' all in my face like they want dick
It's about to hit the fan, hit the floor
That's all I can stands, and I can't stands no more
What is it? Niggas think they bigger
Because they got their finger on the trigger of a biscuit
They don't know I'm wicked when I start to kick it
Eat they raw sound, wash it down with a Mistic
Better yet a Snapple
Nigga want the juice but he don't want the hassle
So we're trying to overthrow the castle
Better yet the temple I'm coming to your town black down
The rental car, the pistol cocked
If you don't want to burn from the Glock
Then beware, I buck shots, meaning what?
The buck stops here, no more dough will be made
Unless it's being made by who?
What's that rhythm, what's that sound?
Party people getting down
When it hit no doubt about
Just release yo' delf

Nigga want Tical, make it happen
You know my fucking style, fuck the rapping
We can take it back to '85 if you wanna start acting like you live
It's all good, I'm rolling with my clique
Owls, Backwoods and Phillies
Smoking cess blunts, mixed with illy got me flustered
Now the whole world looks dusted
I'm in the area with the steel that never rusted
For real, nigga touch it and you burn
When will motherfuckers learn?
What be spreading like a germ? Haha, it's Meth, word
I be that early bird that got the worm and if you check it
I'm on point, like a fax machine you get the message
It be's no question it's them, bust the second guessings
Keep your thoughts on your lessons
What the Blood Clot!?!
To tell the truth you don't amaze me
Killa Hill Project, a Star Trek phaser couldn't faze me
What? Check the Raider Ruckus, fuck this
Smoke a Dutchmaster, have 'em screaming for the dutchess
Yeah, I gotta have it, so I strive to stack my papes
If I don't do it for mydelf, I'ma do it for Kase
'Cause that's my peoples
I'm giving you injections that be lethal
Weapons, when niggas start to half stepping, then I get evil
But don't let that negative vibe right there mislead you
I'm humble, a fucking Killa Bee, far from bumble
I sting you - bzzz - and I bring you
Thirty-six Chambers of head banger, bitch
What ya deal with? I think the mic's on the fritz
Faggot soundmen, they be sabotaging shit
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Meth-Tical, let the whole world know my fucking name
What the Blood Clot!?!
Yeah, yeah, you know what I'm saying?
Keep it reals on this thing
First of all I'd like to give a big up, peace and shout out
To my brothers in the belly of the beast
Raider Ruckus, we friends to the end and back again, baby. One love
Gin Lover, Shitty Brown, Pus Head, Pil, the P.L.L
Stack DAT, Dusty, Storm, Suu! We still in here, nigga
Jamel, one love, baby, Nice
Uncle Eric aka Shane, I ain't forget you, nigga

Who lit that shit it was I the chinky-eye
Chiba-hawk from New York, Tical Staten Isle
Niggas thought, that they could walk a dog but they caught
A bad situation, cause I'm a sandwich short
Of a picnic, cause you ain't equipped with the sickening
Style, blowing up the spot like ballistic
Missiles, I be comin through like the four-nine-three-eleven
Tearing up the power-u, Meth-Tical
A bad motherfucking buddah monk, what the fuck
Hit your chest, like cardiac arrest, blow the front
Out the frame, hit the pussycat for the pain
Of the dog shit, nobody move run your garments
A rugged vet, durable like a Champion sweat
Wrap a power in a tec, to wet
A nigga up, with all the dangerous diseases
Sniffling, sneezing, coughing, aching, stuffy head fever
Fucker, I think it's bout time that you suffer
Bobbing on my knob like an all day sucker
Bitch!
Meth Vs. Chef
Meth Vs. Chef (Let's bring this shit)
Meth Vs. Chef (Yeah, one more time!)
Meth Vs. Chef
I blow your fuckin ass to death

I'm goin all out kid no turnbacks
You could try to front, get smoked and that's that
Lyric assassin, dressed in black rugged
Sixteen shots to your mug, from a slug then
I go to war in a concrete jungle, making bundles
Niggas act funny, and fumble
But I relax, count my shells, a lot of heads gotta fly
Niggas stay strapped, armed to die
Time for jet-black Tim boot, flowin
Wha-Su God get him, hit em with the nine troop
No question, cha-cha-BOW in the session
Bloodshot in that direction, cypher
Attack you like chess moves best move
Yo, yeah, yo
The boards, your ass
'Tack, 'tack, 'tack, uh!
Attack the boards like chess moves, best move
At Rae through, comin at your motherfuckin crew
Live direct, yeah you better step
Gunshots ring on the set

With some quick high Rae stay fly, and rob your Isle
Airwaves, yo behave

Here comes the ruckus, the motherfucking ruckus
Thousands of cut-throats and crumb-snatching fuckers
Straight from the brain, I'll be giving you the pain, anger
Coming from the 36th Chamber, bang!
Tical, hitting with the Buddha-Fist style
Shotgun slamming in your chestpiece, plow!
Frame is blown all over the terrain
Like a man without no arms you can't hang
Time for a change of the guard
You've been arrested for lyric fraud now you barred
For real, check it, I pull strings like B.B. King on guitar
I'm the true Fist of the North Star!

Ooooooooh! What a tangled web we weave
When first we practice to deceive
Guns be clicking, running with my clan we be sticking
Whatever, my street family stays together
Represent what I invent, Killa Hill resident
Rest in peace to my nigga Two Cent
The street life is the only life I know
I live by the code, style â€’ it's mad â€’ P.L.O
Iranian thoughts and cover like an Arabian
Grab the nigga on the spot and put a nine to his cranium
I can't get no satisfaction, niggas won't be lasting
Long, unless they get protection for real
Strong, coming with my Clan so what's happening
Commercial rap, hate it with a passion
The M-E-T-H-O-D got me drinking
O.E. all night in a M.P.V
Just maxing, looking for hoes, you know relaxing
Bitches know the hour, it be time for some action

Damn, I hate it when it rain
Ever since I came in the game, some hated on the fame
A lot of niggas done changed and started actin' strange
Even labels turning they backs and started backin' lames
Radio is the same, whole lotta speculatin'
These mutherfuckas defacatin' on the name
Wu-Tang, if this is where the hip-hop is
Radio lyin' then, that ain't where the hip-hop live
It lives in the streets, we eat to live, they livin' to eat
I'm fed up, that nigga Ryderson, I'm givin him sleep
R.I.P., make me the king of all I see
And when death call, I'm good, I got call ID
See it was Clan in the front, now they just gon' front
Like my joints is on Proactiv, and they just don't bump (Come on, man)
Then niggas gon' say I lost my skill
When in fact, they all been programmed and lost they feel, for real
They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say, yeah
They've got so much things to say right now (Yeah)
They've got so much things to say, yeah (Yeah)

Damn, another artist chokes again
They ain't cut as close as him or even broke the skin
See how niggas ain't your friends when there ain't no ends
Don't care who the case offend, don't underrate my pen
I got what it takes to win, while y'all thinkin' I'm trash
Lovin' the taste of success and this drink in my glass
Watch 'em cosign that whack shit, give it a pass
'Til it's gone, quicker than Red, can't get rid of them crabs
When they're wrong, call the cops, their credibility's shot
It's time they learned what's hot really is and really is not
Off-brand niggas, Meth gon' let 'em know off top
Don't get smacked on DVDs, tryna show off Glocks
I can't stop 'cause my enemies plot, or 'cause the cops want me
Shackled and locked inside the penalty box
And while they waitin' for my shit to flop
They gettin' pimped like hoes, sellin' they ass just to get my spot, come on, man

They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say, yeah
They've got so much things to say right now (Yeah)
They've got so much things to say, yeah (Yeah)
Ask Miss Hill, half these critics ain't got half this skill
Or been so hungry that they have to steal
If I didn't have my deal, and didn't have this mass appeal
Then I'm back up in that trap, slingin' crack, it's real
And that ain't worth the time, so search and find
A new nerve and here's three words: stop working mine
It take a lot more to hurt my pride, jerk my vibe
More than media lies, cried when Dirt Dog died, nigga
The last album, wasn't feelin' my style
This time my foot up in they ass, bet they feelin' me now
'Cause Tical, he put his heart in every track he do
But somehow y'all find someway to give a whack review
It ain't all good, they writin' that I'm Hollywood
Tryna tell you my shit ain't ghetto and they hardly hood
Come on, man, until you dudes can write some rhymes
Keep that in mind when you find yourself reciting mines

They've got so much things to say right now

You and I, 'til the day we die (Trackmasters)
Yo, yo

Ex-girlfriend, how you been?
I see you still tryna fuck with other women's men
Remember when I first met you in my cousin's house?
A week later, we was fuckin' on your mama couch
Now it's been said that big girls, they don't cry (Uh)
But they damn sure lie, look you in the eye, sayin' you they only
You and I, 'til the day we die
Said you'd never leave me lonely (Uh-huh)
Fly tenderoni, but you phony
Shoulda listened when my mama told me (Uh)
Soon as I turned my back, you tried to fuck my homies
That was then, this is now, I got a new friend
Ever since I cut them loose ends, you wanna bone me
Add strife to my life, pussy that'll make me think twice
About leavin' the wife even, picture that
You ain't want me when you had me
Now you on your third baby daddy
And you hate to see a nigga happy
So you're tryin' mad ways to trap me (Oh, babe)
Lookin' at my girl nasty, tryna throw the pussy at me (Uh)
Now look at this bitch over here tryna act like me
Uh-huh, fuck that bitch, she must like leftovers

I'm still in love with you, babe (You and I, 'til the day we die)
Every break up
I'm still in love with you, babe
Just to make up
I'm still in love with you, babe (You and I, 'til the day we die)
Oh, girl

Little bit of loving you, babe
Girl, I'm in love, girl (Yo, yo)

It's always you and your crusty-ass crew, be actin' new
Let me find out you fuckin' with boo, and y'all gon' feel it
Waitin' for the day that you front, and catch a lump
From my black butterfly, that arm pack a lullaby
Sleep on her, she said you bitches tried to creep on her
In the mall and didn't know she had the reach on her
Pearl-handle .22, my boo
She go ahead and walk her dogs and represent Wu
To the fullest, you and hon can shoot the fair one, I'll bring the bullets
You know what I'm sayin'? Stop playin'
You and them dyke-lookin' bitches actin' like y'all jumpin' somethin'
Go 'head with that bullshit (Motherfucker)
I'm still in love with you, babe (You and I, 'til the day we die)

Show this nigga mad love, but get no love, nigga?
Stupid-ass
Plus, I heard that he be beatin' on you
I seen him at the club cheatin' on you (Uh)
With your best friend, got you stressin'
And used up, pull your shoes up
All you need's affection
But you're headed in the wrong direction
Tryna make this nigga jealous, with other fellas
All up in my face actin' overzealous (Uh-huh)
Like you want somethin' from Meth, I hope it ain't love, girl
'Cause I ain't got none left for you, plus you miserable
And misery love company, shit, I'm livin' comfortably
Don't need no nigga huntin' me down for fuckin' 'round
With his kitty, talk to him
Before my brother put a spark through him, won't be pretty
The situation got my whole attitude shitty
And got you actin' high saditty with your slut committee, you know I know
So go find another sucker, yo
I been there and been done that befo', and don't need it no mo'
That's my word
So go to your room with that there, word up
And tell that big head nigga you run with to do the same

Uh, yeah
Choose a side

Look, vibe with me
Rhyme is tricky, who ridin' with me
Who kinda miss me can kindly miss me, you kinda iffy
Don't know the history? I'm from the city of stop-and-frisk me
The cops is jiggy, they spot the blickey then try and get me
My pops a Willie, said "Give her fifty, she pop her kitty"
He Bad Boy and he Poppa really, it's not a Biggie
See my committee, block offici', it's not an ishy
Or I'm too lazy to cross roads, if not, I'm busy
It's not a mystery who shot Ricky, but where the difference
Between the trÃ© and the dough boy, we bred different
So bear witness, this can leave you with head missing
If y'all can hear me, I guarantee you the feds listening
So I be spittin' in barcode, nothin' left in the tap, dog
And after the last call, the bar close
This my Cohiba, cigar blow
Even Tony Stark knows the tension is thick as Wallabee Clark soles
But did I mention I'm sick and gotta be hardcore
Hard-boiled, taking your base, that's what we ball for
Money over bimbos, that's what the Mob for
Rappers stuck in limbo 'cause they were settin' the bar low
Every time I rhyme on a track, it's like a convo
King, we put the nine to your back, it's like you Rondo
When it come to John, though, I'ma slaughter a John Doe
Drag him through a drive-thru like he ordered the combo
Hands on him, we wild style with the cans on him
Then come defeat, that's my beliefs and I stand on 'em
Give you the beats, no Doc Dre or brands on 'em
Some men want 'em, these verses hot and the fans want 'em
I'm from the school of them hard knocks with harder standards
I've been a hard rock before they added the Arm & Hammers
My meth bananas, bogus method, we call it bama
Gun on the camera so we can shoot them in panoramas
Na-nana-nana, I'm feelin' petty, but watch your manners
Use proper grammar so we could stop with the propaganda
No type of slander but tell them hoes, "I'm not your Santa"
Just want the body, nobody tryin' to pot-and-pan ya
Cop scanners, a fuller house but we not the Tanners
If shooters bringin' them Hawks out, then it's not Atlanta's
If time is money, I got time and time saved
I pull your blinds and stop shine behind shade
Nobody get 'til I got mine, my mind made
If time is money, I got time and time saved
I pull your blinds and stop shine behind shade
Nobody get 'til I got mine, my mind made

Choose a side
Math vs Meth, Cival War

If time is money, I got time and time saved
I pull your blinds and stop shine behind shade
Nobody get 'til I got mine, my mind made
If time is money, I got time and time saved
I pull your blinds and stop shine behind shade

This is (Mr. Sandman, bring me a good dream)
Serious, the craziest, da-da
(Mr. Sandman, bring me a good dream)
Day-da, danger, dangerous style

Lyrical shots from the Glock
Bust bullet holes on the charts
I want the number one spot
What's the science? I'm a giant
New York defiant, brutal like domestic violence
Silence of the Lambs, occurred when I slammed in
Program the jams to be fat as Ralph Kramden
Others come with shit as silly as Art Carney
But my technique tranquilizes more kids than Barney
Remedy for stress is three bags of sess
A day at my rest playin' chess, yes
My thoughts be sneaky like a crook from Brooklyn
When you ain't lookin', I take the queen with the rook then
I get vexed, layin' phat tracks on Ampex
Puffin' skunk, gettin' drunk off of Triple X
Ballantine's, I got more love than Valentine
The violent mind, I blast wit' a silent nine

My hazardous thoughts to cut the mic's life support short
Brains get stained like tablecloths when I let off
Powerful poetry pushed past the point of no return
Leavin' mics with third-degree burns
Let me at 'em, I grip your style like a spasm
Drag 'em through the mud then I bag 'em
We're screamin' hardcore, hip-hop drips out my pores
And I be raw, for four score plus seven more
I strike like a bowling ball, holdin' y'all hostage like jail
Electrifyin' like the third rail
Beats are smashed with paragraphs of ruckus
Wu-Tang! Clan ain't nothin' to fuck wit'
Hot time, summer in the city
My people represent, get busy
The heat-seeker, on a mission from hell's kitchen
I gets in where I fits in for head-touchin', listen
Enemy is the industry, got me flippin'
I don't give a fuck! Tell that bitch and her nigga
I'm killin', snipin', catchin' murder cases
Desert Stormin', I be searchin' for oasis
As I run a mile wit' a racist
Pullin' swords, hit the Billboard wit' a bullet
Peace to the number seven
Everybody else get the fo'-nine-three-eleven

Mr. Sandman, bring me a good dream
I don't know what's going on, if you can take us there

Yo, watch me bang the headpiece, there's no survival
My flow lights up the block like a homicidal
Murder, underground beef for the burger
P.L.O., criminal thoughts you never heard of
I switch, the city never sleeps, life's a bitch
I shit, runnin' through bitches like Emmitt Smith
Caution, niggas best to be careful crossin'
The street, before they end up layin' in a coffin
Don't sleep, niggas tend to forget, however
Peep this â€” my nigga Kase lives forever
What evil lurks in the heart of men?
It be the Shadow, street-life, flowin' again
I had a plot, scheme, I knew for sure
Only one kick would knock the hinges off the door
The dread tried to jet, Sabrina at his neck
Thirteen pounds on the table plus a tech
Just when I said, "Where the fuck's the C.R.E.A.M.?"
Another dread came out the kitchen with the M-16
He tried to cock it, blast three shots like rockets
Crushed his collarbone, ripped his arm out the socket
My move for the table was swift, I got my hostage
(The nigga tried to stab you, God!) but I dodged it
Niggas said, "Carlton, you's a ill motherfucker"
'Cause I made it look like they both killed each other
And I'm out

Mr. Sandman, bring me a good dream
Mr. Sandman, bring me a good dream

You know what I'm sayin'?

Iâ€™m from the killa killa hill, we keep it real consistent
For that dollar dollar bill, we will murder you in an instant
Fuck what your name is, youâ€™ll be non-existent
If you ever try to show any form of resistance
Iâ€™m strong in the hood. Iâ€™m in a good position
When I walk they salute, when I talk they all listen
You acting the part like you in an audition
Where shoot outâ€™s in the parks is a daily tradition
This is modern warfare, we play with live ammunition
Shot you through your third eye, will change your whole disposition
The body never lie, call me the mortician
Every death has a story to tell, so pay attention
Premonitions on my life, slip the banana clip in
Never put your hat on the bed, Iâ€™m a little superstitious
Got my black suit on, they say I am acting suspicious
Big gun in my palm, look like my arm is missing

Ayo one MC two MC
When my gun out, everybody goes down
Word on the street, these boys get butter
Fuck with me, nigga, cause this straight gutta
Ayo one MC two MC
When my gun out, everybody goes down
Word on the street, these boys get butter
Fuck with me, nigga, cause this straight gutta

Got them big guns, make â€˜em disappear, call â€˜em wizards
Will oblige, till you meet your demise, this shit is physics
Mr. Barka newest gee on the block, he is the shizit
Suffer Mossberg wounds to ya frame, you move a smidgen
Hanz rollin with the man he the Meth, pay you a visit
Prerequisite have them all in the dirt. They all can get it
Used to percolate the crack in the pot, until it dried
Now I am occupying spots on your block, that shit is aye
And when we popping off the gun at your top, we make it pie
You better take another look at your seeds, and holla bye
Yo as far as maâ€™fuckas concerned, yo this is it

As far as guns & that street shit go, my niggas fit

Caesar planet of the grapes in the weed jar

Everything dirty wear a rubber for the come up
Block nigga shine like a 5D shutta
Red, Hanz & Street run this mother

We getting beaucoup scrilla
My brothers on their grind
Not another Columbine call me new school killa
Scoop of French vanilla brought a duce duce with her
I might pull a Lil Jon and let the bruce bruce hit her
Iâ€™ll be gone till November gon' cry me a river
You could die, but I figure Iâ€™ma try and be the bigger man
I and my gorillas, they gonna fry em up for dinner

Build For This Remix

Sort of like Malcolm at the Audubon
They coming for me, time is money no Audemar
See bar-for-bar, I keep it pushing no R&R
No foreign broads and no promotion for foreign cars
The game is ours, letâ€™s keep it funky who said he was
Like Staten Island, Italians bleed spaghetti sauce
If y'all ain't shaking or stacking than y'all already lost
Already cross the light, Christ I'm ready for em
Plus anybody that saying no, Iâ€™m taking numbers
Iâ€™m taking names, Iâ€™ll take your chain take this hunger
Pain, pain, pain
Then you feel the thunder and rain I donâ€™t talk it like the rainbow
I get it done and the game yâ€™all
Do me a favor, donâ€™t ever play with my ball
Never been a player-hater I just ain't playing with y'all
You watching lame but look Iâ€™m taking the charge
Going hard will get you two shots now Iâ€™m facing the charge

Fire up the la letâ€™s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if youâ€™re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess Iâ€™ll see you when you wake up on the other side
Now, ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary
Still ballin', ridin' on these niggas â€˜cause they lame
In a '61 Chevy, still heavy in this game
Can you feel me? Blame it on my mama, I'm a thug nigga
Up before the sun rise, quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga, then we first to bomb, bust
On these bitch-made niggas, hit 'em up
Westside! Ain't nobody loved me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger, Lord forgive me if I smoke niggas
I love my females strapped, then fuck her from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California is where I'm at
Ridin', passed by while these niggas wondered why
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try
Did I cry? Hell nah, nigga, tears shed
For all my homies in the pen, many peers dead; a nigga still ballin'

Fire up the la letâ€™s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if youâ€™re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess Iâ€™ll see you when you wake up on the other side

The world is mine nigga get back
Don't mess with my stack the gauge is racked
About to drop the bomb I'm the Westcoast don
Big fish in a small pond
Now the feds trying to throw they book at the crook
But I shook they worm and they hook
Guppies hold they breath. They want to miss me when I'm tipsy
Running everything westside of the Mississippi
Its the unseen, pulling strings with my pinky ring
We got your woman, pucker up 'fore we fuck her up
Bow down before I make a phone call
Got 25 niggas running up on y'all
For the cheese we want them keys
Everybody freeze on your knees, butt naked please
Before any of you guppies get heart
Nigga rewind my part fool

Fire up the la letâ€™s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if youâ€™re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess Iâ€™ll see you when you wake up on the other side

Now everybody wanna see us dead
Two murdered on the front page
Shot to death, bullets to the head
Niggas holla out my name and it's similar to rape
Motherfuckers know I'm comin', so they runnin' to they graves
Watch! Swoop down with my nigga from the Pound
â€˜Cause Trick don't give a fuck
Where you coward niggas now?
Blast, keep pumpin', ain't worried about nothin'
Busters thought we was frontin'
So reload and keep dumpin'; still ballin'

Seven-thousand, four hundred, twenty three grains
Of sand drop from the hourglass
It's how much time I got left on this planet
Some motherfucker's gotta die!
I'm an evil motherfucker ready to tear shit up
I'm gonna put these things on you, and never let up
See, my momma...she was wrong when I was born
That a nigga like E should'a never been born
Too late, big mistake in '72
It's '92, now the year of code blue
15 hours..11 minutes..30 seconds
I'm a motherfuckin' wreck
Gonna pay back niggas who did me wrong in the past
My days ain't long
I'm comin' strong and fast
Lock up 8 niggs..kill up 10 pigs
Innocent and fuckers are also dyin, too
Now what else can I do?
Fuck, fuck, fuck and plant my seeds
Leavin' kids in this world like me
The lunatic psycho mutherfucka Eazy-E
Fire up the la letâ€™s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if youâ€™re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess Iâ€™ll see you when you wake up on the other sideEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

What? What you want?
Represent represent represent
Yeah, represent, check it out check it out

Yo mama don't wear no drawers!
I saw her when she took them off!
Standing on the welfare line
Eating swine trying to look fine, with her stank behind
You can ask the bitch and she'll tell ya fast
Meth-Tical got STYLE with his nasty ass

Are you ready, to face the consequences and suffer?
I even tell ya momma you ain't shit, motherfucker
Bring it, and let that killer bee kid sting it
And rep-resent, it's like heads up a brick, when I swing it
Get lost, I break you off something
I'm pumping, like a Reebok, with a pump
From the jump and, you was nothing
Bet you thought you fucking clan had ya back but they was fronting
Smoking dirt blunts and fucking nasty sluts and
You just a naked gun without the bullet, what you busting
Get your ship sunken, fucking with a drunken
Master disaster at any rap functions
Just an echo, yoo-hoo
We be living in the valley yoo-hoo
It may be difficult to bring back
Sweet memories of you
And you can even ask your crew
Bet your bottom dollar that they tell ya fast
Meth-Tical got STYLE with his nasty ass

Who said the Wu-Tang Clan? Was it you or your man?
You wanna point the finger, I'll bring ya
36 chambers, be out, you'se in danger
Let me pull your brain out your ass with a hanger
Didn't momma tell ya not to talk to a stranger?
Now ya got ya neck, in the noose, of the strangler
Just recline, keep the Meth in mind
I'll even test the knuckle check on the hands of time
What? And I'll be more than glad to bust that ass
All up and down the block, the street, that ave
Whatever, smoking on a Spike Lee joint
Hey I'm Mo' Better, I'm hoping niggas get the point
Cause they could never, stop the veteran, word to God
When I'm severing the head of a mental vegetarian
The Method, at the weed gate, with a long line of credit
If you desire fire, I be the first to set it
Off, flame on like the Human Torch
Fantastic Four for all the fans in the store
You can eat it all and it'll tell you fast
Meth-Tical got STYLE for your nasty ass
94 baby, word up, recognize, recognize
Wu-Tang killer bee
The RZA and the Method MZA
Raider Ruckus, where you at?7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

First, there was the collapse of civilization
Anarchy, genocide, starvation
Then, when it seemed like shit couldn't get any more fucked up
We got the Plague, the Living Death
Closing his icy grip around the whole planet
Then the rumors started
The last hardcore MCs were working on the cure, that would end the pestilence
Why?
I like the death
I like the misery
I like this world
The Final Frontier
These are the voyages of the Starship Tical

As I walk in the shadow of death
Sixteen men on a dead man's chest
Your host this evening, Mr H-O-T
N-I-X, you get splashed with the TEC
Nobody go 'til the god say so
You got a second or more to run for the door
Before I blow back off the map, contact
You didn't know Stat' could get down like that
Who want them test rocket launcher, yes
Mr. Meth, hold the fort, most def
Cats is dead wrong, song's too long
Get swung on, can't we all get along?
See my pinkie, see my thumb
See that kid with the pump shotgun?
Bust your gums, leave your whole shit numb
Hmm, now what's this? Smell like fish
Mr. Big Mouth, the gat be trout
You need to douche out your style, no doubt
Johnny struck through the Shaolin slum
Prum-prum-prum on my Shaolin drum
Niggas don't dare to step in the square
Kids ain't playing over here, playa
Only one way, and that's my way
Grim Reaper calling, Judgement Day
Ten let the countdown begin
Nine, I was born in the mind
Eight, take the head of a snake
Seven, behold Armageddon
Six, ain't no love for the rich
Five, only strong will survive
Four, 'cause we live by the sword
Three, plus sixty degrees
Two, for the black and the blue
One, for the sun
Step into millennium

The name of this one is "Judgement Day"
No more B.S., can't come out and play
Don't blame me, blame society
Type of chemistry for a live MC
Hands in the air like you just don't care
You all get a share, there's a party over here
Year 2000, keep bouncin'
T-Minus, thirty seconds and countin'
New York's finest, still wilding
Shaolin, at the full moon howling
Get 'til it's gone, Killa Bee kills
Only time will reveal like the words in the song
'Cause love's what I feel for my crew, bust steel
Niggas don't got to pay my bills
P.L.O., pack the slingshot flow
Plant the seed, let the garden grow
And stick that rhyme where the sun don't shine
Darts pierce your heart like the Valentine
This my "Tale From the Crypt," that's sick
Bloodbath, body bags and shit
UFC fighting championships
G.I. Joes with the kung-fu grip
Now you don't dare, to step in the square
Kids ain't playing over here, playa
Only one way, and that's my way
Grim Reaper calling, Judgement Day
Come on, I said come on
Ten let the countdown begin
Nine, I was born in the mind
Eight, take the head of a snake
Seven, behold Armageddon
Six, ain't no love for the rich
Five, only strong will survive
Four, 'cause we live by the sword
Three, plus sixty degrees
Two, for the black and the blue
One, for the sun
Step into millennium
