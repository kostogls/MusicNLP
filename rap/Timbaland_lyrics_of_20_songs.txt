This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

Yeah, it really sucks, but ever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my señorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life is good, but me and you we a catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy – it's crazy
I can’t help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change, ah
Is it my mistake, thinking that where I am and where you at?
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect pair and now it seems that we don’t match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain

I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

Uh! I am the topic of conversation, this is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication, to life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever-so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something

Is it goin'? Is it goin'?
Is it goin'? Is it going?
I don't know what you're lookin' for
Oh, yeah, boy, come on

I'm the type of girl that look you dead in the eye, eye
I'm real as it comes, if you don't know why I'm fly-y-y-y-y
I seen you to try switch it up, but girl, you ain't that dope
I'm the Wonder Woman, let me go get my rope
I'm a supermodel and mommy — sí, mami
Amnesty International, got Bangkok to Montauk on lock
Love my ass and my abs in the video called "Promiscuous"
My style is ri-dic-dic-diculous-ulous-ulous

If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

When Timbo' is in the party, everybody put up they hands
I get a half a mil' for my beats, you get a couple gra-a-and
Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from Californ-I-A way down to Japan
I'm a real producer, and you just a piano man
Your songs don't top the charts — I heard 'em, I'm not a fa-a-an
Niggas talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

Could you speak up and stop mu-mumbling? I don't think you came in clear
When you're sittin' on the top, it's hard to hear you from way up here
Now I saw you tryna act cute on TV, "Just let me clear the air..."
We missed you on the charts last week — damn, that's right, you wasn't there
If s-sexy never left, then why is everybody on my shi-i-it?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way
'Cause our run will never be over — not, at least, until we say (Uh)

If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

Oh... (Damn, improve)

Can't fathom where I'm at, baby, pop another pill

If you want to make a movie let me know
It's a whole another film
I suggest you get your dress for the Golden Globes
What you know about Tim
Top down, the Aventador, 4 AM
On the sunset strip
Trying to get high at the sunset, baby don't trip
Hollywood lights, Miami nights
I'm on a motherfucking binge
Just might go and buy a Benz
Or trade a car for your friends
Oh yeah, we playing with them M's

Ridin' down Collins with my entourage following
Just left SoHo headed to the Go-Go
Lap dance for the girls
Let me put her hands on her curves
You ain't about that life, you scurred
Ah, baby, you scurred—like skrrt to the crib

What you know bout me, what you know bout me
What you know bout me, what you know bout me
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing
Not a muthafuckin thing, not a muthafuckin thing

No one killing the game, shit is all for the taking
What the fuck did I stutter? Am I being mistaken?
I'm a s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-star in the makin'
Who you said was the man? What the fuck is a deal?
Really do it the best, I'm DJ Khaled for real
Got my thumb on the pulse, got impeccable timin'
If they forgot about my worth, I got a check to remind 'em
Got some things on the wrist, Cartier with the diamonds
If this was 10 years ago nigga would've went diamond
I been singing and rapping, I make a killin' in both
If I had to choose a Jackson man, I'm feelin' like Bo
Fresh down to the socks, team look like the Raiders
I don't take this shit for granted, I'd like to thank my creator
I'm coming b-b-b-b-b-b-b-back on you haters
I'm 'bout to put this bitch on her back and get back to you later

Don't need to change your clothes, girl, or your last name
Motherfuckers want to act like I'mma call
If you want to be a star, girl you need a co-star
Got some bitches we can call up, babe
Now they want to know who you are and how you got there

My moon belongs to your sun
Your fire is burning my mind
Is it love or is it lust?
Something that I just can't describe (Ah)
Am I the one and only? (Ah)
Cause you're the only one (Ah)
It felt so long and lonely (Ah)
Waiting for you to come

Later you'll carry me home
I wanna go undercover
I just wanna rattle your bones
Yes, I'm the one and only
But I'm not the only one
So let's work overtime
On this shift, stay up with the sun
Maybe we can start a riot
Maybe we can burn this town
Maybe I’ll be your vampire

She says she need somebody she can count on
And when she dial my number, I don't pick it up
Alright, alright, girl, now I gotta catch my flight
Alright, alright, girl, I can't be that somebody every day
She say she';; find somebody if it ain't me
And I'm getting the feeling that she finna creep
(Boy give me a call back) That's what the message said
That shit stuck in my head, she said I never did
(Boy give me a call back) She could be in his arms
She 'bout to break my heart, she 'bout to break my heart

I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
Oh man, I think my girl might be cheating on the low
I really hate to say it, but tonight I need to know
Need to know, are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
I think my girl might be cheating, UFO, UFO
He could be alone with a dancer
Hear it in his tone when he answer
Four or five hoes in a week
But if I go out to cheat then I have no standards
Fuck that, tonight I'mma live
Find me someone in these streets
Freak on him slowly and not feel emotion
Cause he would do the same to me, no doubt
So I'mma get even, I never believe him, you telling me a lie
I'mma get busy and find me a nigga to lay with tonight
Pimpin' ain't nothing but game (game)
Treat all these hoes the same (same)
Niggas and women, we all lie about how we living
We all lie about where we staying
We all lie about who we laying, we all do
We all lie about who we cuffing
We all lie about who we fucking, we all do
Baby don't worry about me, I be on the run like Bey
You ain't gotta hide your face
'Cause I'm probably in the room right next to your suite

Where your heart went? You must lost it in a coffin, hey-ey-ey
I'm smoking, taking me loses, I can't cry about you, no way-ay-ay
I'm a playa but it caught me off guard, I'mma say-ay-ay
Bitches don’t cheat on niggas this rich, bitch, you must be a misfit
I'm drinking, fucking my kidney, you got my going ballistic
Don't tell me you kissing niggas with my favorite lipstick
Not my bitch
Mamacita, no love lost, used to moving them drugs off
When a nigga he-a serve you
They come back and run up in your drug house
You lying bitch, who you lying to, tell me who you lying to
You rather taint my impression, how I look at you, how I honor you
We spent days up, I'm just thinking, did you get laid up?
Talking and conversating, hoping you tell me the truth
I thought I was bulletproof, until I found out a clue
You might be fucking him and him
And every brother around this bitch
I never knew until I thought I knew
He can't fuck you like me anyway, you must be getting back at me
Maybe my mind's playing tricks on me
I'm feeling guilty cause these hoes on me
I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
Oh man, I think my girl might be cheating on the low
I really hate to say it, but tonight I need to know
Need to know, are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO

Get out, you can't be in here, you have to get out
I implore you, please?.. Please?..
You are all going to die down here...

It's life or death, either one
The king is back, take head and run
I piss and take a shit on your beats for fun
I killed the Game, I ain't even use a gun
Who better than me? Don't make me laugh
I run this shit, they just chase my ass
I ain't talkin' shit nigga just tellin' the facts
I think all the tracks I'm hearin' from niggas is whack
I be hearin' this niggas, what they say in their rhymes
I took my spot, nobody gave me mine
I make the beats, that "Boom Boom Boom" in they trunks
You disagree homie then go on and jump
You can bump your gums, you can say what you want
That's all you gon' do, 'cause you niggas is punk
I'm number one, you ain't nuttin' but shit
When they need a hit, I'm who they come to get
Talk to me

If you got love for me, I got love for you
If you won't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you
We can do it however you wanna do
Nigga, if you won't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you
Go 'head
Kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
(If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself)
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
Go kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself
(If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself)

Yo
Hey
I'm tired of niggas, niggas is tired
You ain't a G, I see bitch in your eyes
If you're close to me, you're supposed to be
But most you rap niggas is hoes to me
Wherever you from, the question i ask
Is do you think I give a fuck, riddle me that
'Cause in my hood you done been to hell and back
This sinister shit, to hell with that
I seen them come, I seen them go

Who's supposed to be in charge, I need to know
When I shake your hand, I'mma step on your toe
Go get your gun, go get your clique
I'mma be right here chillin' with your bitch
You mad at me, cause I'm getting' rich?
Well Put the pistol to your head and empty the clip

Some is stars, some is lames
How they follow little trends to get they fame?
I ain't snap my damn fingers to get in the game
You claim you rich, show me, son
If you got so many dollars then lone me one
Fools think they're killers they own a gun
When you know you bout as sweet as a honey bun
Trashy broads, behind the bar
Like you tattooed your frontin' heart
VIP bands don't make you a star
Like we really still don't know who the fuck you are
Don't talk behind my back, just call me nigga
Move my heart to the side, make room to forgive ya
If you still wanna hang, we'll come to get ya
Put the rope around your neck, jump my nigga
You're all going to die down here
Get out, get out, you can't be in here
You're all going to die down here1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Magazines, you can catch me on the cover, girl

I hover the Earth, and cover the world
I spit so thick, imma call it a pearl
I see you tryna claim her, now I play with her pearls
Try to come at me, with all of my 
Life's a bitch, but I made her my girl
Now she does what I say, does what I please

Jack and Jill went up the hill
Each with a buck and a quarter
Jill came back with $2.50
What a working girl, now work it, girl! Like..

I love when I see your pretty ass on the floor
I love when I see you break it down like you in control

I got a cup to my right, and a girl to my left
And I'm stumbling when I'm out of breath
Like g-g-g-g-g-g-go
Like g-g-g-g-g-g-go
I got girls on my right, I got girls on my left
The one in the middle and I'm feeling on her breath

I love when you, making me
Oh pass at me, oh pass at me

If we're a team that is enough
No boundaries, we're fearless

In this world that we're creating
Magic's all around

We can lift the darkness with our light
'Cause everybody's in harmony

Whenever chaos (Kaos) gets crazy
Trouble knocks on the door
With your heart above the floor
Keep shining, yeah, keep trying
If something's wrong we'll be strong
Face your fears until they're gone

In this world that we're creating
Magic's all around
We can fly above the ground

Dance all (night)
I said dance all (night)

Hey baby girl: Looking all done up
I wanna know: Where did you come from?
The heat begin to raise... Hot woman
The club about to go into flames... Baby, speakers thumping
Let's party hard, and just move something
The vibe is right and it goes, goes, goes, goes something like this:

Such a beautiful crowd...
The levels on 10...
People standing on chairs with their hands up in the air
Girls getting real wild...
Hair blowing in the wind...
Girls standing on the chairs with their hands up in the air

...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
High heels, standing on them soft couch cushions
Careful, not to break her concentration
Maintain sexy as she maintains balance (balance)
If you fall, baby girl it won't be cute at all (at all)
Drink in your left hand (left hand)
Girlfriend in your right (your right)
On the couch dancing (dancing)
Holding on for dear life (life)
Thump of the music (plus!)
The flash of the light (plus!)
Long legs and a short skirt equal one hell of a night!
Know what I'm talking about?



Uh, hands in the air
Uh, hands in the air
I got my eyes closed!
Jumping up and down, baby I'm on ten
I got my eyes closed!
Listen to the sounds, so hypnotizing (Hey!)
And I bet before the night ends (Hey!)
I'm going to find one that I'm liking
Take her home, get it on next morning
Baby girl, give me that one more gin before you go
(I got my hands in the air) I got my eyes closed
(I got my hands in the air) I got my eyes closed
(I got my hands in the air) I got my eyes closed
(I got my hands in the air)
My hands, my hands, in the air, in the air...

Get it get it girl get it on the floor
I got that good what I give ya going go
Whether you rhyme slow or the beat fast
I beat the breaks off the beat pad
Them hoes like "Timbo, he’s bad"
Bitch, I never love ya off your knee pad
VA Beach the best that I could be reached at
Want a number one hit?
Bring your pen and your weed stash
Quick flipping up SexyBack
Top of the charts nigga that’s where we at
Where ya at? Boost mobile
I’m Nextel, you heard chirp
My records sell yes sir, my records sell, yes sir

We running that show all around the globe
But you ain’t gotta act like you know, we give it to ya
It’s just that every word that comes outta your mouth
Some old bitch that we did before, we give it to ya

If anybody got a problem with me, y'all come get me

I ain't got a problem in the world nigga, thorough nigga
Represent the borough nigga, B.K. all day
Man up, girl-nigga, I don't give a fuck
Buck-buck, die, nigga, you ain't my nigga
Slow dreaming up ways to help you niggas die quicker
Ha, quicker-ha, laughing all the way to the top
Two hundred milli in cash, thirty-five mill in stock
I diddy bop like Diddy
Back when Biggie cock-eyes hypnotized the masses
Behind Versace glasses, Coogi sweaters, Pelle leathers
I been doing this for forever, so whatever
However, wherever, whenever (whenever)
Why-ever? I back down never (I'll never)
Actions speak louder than words
You ain't heard it from me, I'm a motherfucking verb

We running that show all around the globe
But you ain’t gotta act like you know, we give it to ya
It’s just that every word that comes outta your mouth
Some old bitch that we did before, we give it to ya, uh
Now I don’t know if you was trying to check
But did you check us at the top of the game? We give it to ya
