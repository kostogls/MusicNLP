Shady, Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, could she be that lady? Ayy

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like "You're—"
I'm like, "I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place"
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow (My shadow)
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo? (Like Tae Bo?)
And possibly bend you over? (Ooh, yeah)
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more (Yeah)
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah, yeah)

Eminem's rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bu and all marvelous, them rollin'
Women just ho-in', big booty rollin'
Soon, I'll be all in them and throwin' D (D)
Hittin' no less than three (Three)
Block wheel style like whee (Whee)
Girl, I can tell you want me, 'cause lately

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow (Yeah, my shadow)
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo? (Like Tae Bo?)
And possibly bend you over? (Ooh, yeah)

Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
Oh, I'm so lonely
I'm Mr. Lonely
I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
Oh, I'm so lonely

Yo, this one here goes out
To all my players out there, man
You know, that got that one good girl, dawg
That's always been there, man
Like, took all the bullshit
But then one day she can't take it no more
And decides to leave me

Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Could've sworn I was dreamin'
For her I was feenin'
So I had to take a little ride
Backtrackin' on these few years
Tryin' to figure out what I do to make it go bad
‘Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashin', and I'm so…
Lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right out of my life
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side
What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby, you a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
‘Cause without you in my life, girl, I'm so…

Lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, baby)
Oh, I'm so lonely
Been all about the world
Ain't never met a girl
That could take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come
Where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasin' you
‘Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy, but now so lonely

Lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely

Never thought that I'd be alone
I didn't think you'd be gone this long
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playin', girl, and come on home
Baby girl, I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out
I never wished that I would ever hurt my baby
And it's drivin' me crazy, ‘cause I'm so…
Lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own, girl)

As life goes on
I'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility
And I realize that everything I do
Is affecting the people around me
So I wanted to take this time out
To apologize for things that I've done
And things that haven't occured yet
And things that they don't want to take responsibility for

I'm sorry for the times that I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know
That you were sitting home, just wishing we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect
I'm sorry for the times I disrespect
I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there
Because I'm in the streets like every day
I'm sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl
I understand that there's some problems and I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me

I'm sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags
Just tryin' to stay busy 'til you heard from Dad
When you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though pops treated us like kings
He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief
I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry that your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the feds came and took me away
I understand that there are some problems and I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me (Oh yeah)
Said you could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me

I'm sorry that it took so long to see
That they were dead wrong tryna put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl tryin' to have fun
Her daddy should've never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage?
In a 21-and-older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame?
Verizon backed out, disgracing my name
I'm just a singer tryin' to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you
And you can put that blame on me (On me)
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)
And you can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me46EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Take you to the motel, ho sale, don't tell, won't tell

Handful of niggas and they all got cheese
So you lookin' at me now, what its gonna be?
Just another tease far as I can see
Trying to get you up out this club
If it means spending a couple dubs
Throwing bout 30 stacks in the back
Make it rain like that ‘cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-dealer use to move 'phetamines
Girl I spend money like it don't mean nothin'
And besides, I got a thing for you

I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know

Move the patty to the Caddy
Baby, you got a fatty, the type I like to marry
Wanting to just give you everything
And that's kind of scary
‘Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass (Ass)
Bouncing, got me tipping my glass (Glass)

Rubbing on that Italian leather
Them Konvict jeans on
You ready?
Yeah
Yeah
Geah! (Konvict)

I get it in 'til the sunrise (Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid
Number one hustler, getting money (Ayy)
Why you wanna count my money?  (Ayy)
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
I'm so paid

I see police on that crooked-I
Doing a hundred on Interstate 95
My shawty leaning, blasting that Do or Die
Wishing that a muddasucka would, ‘cause we certified
Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hope they never call off
And them snipers sitting on the roof already saw y'all
It ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
Rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Than let them haters come and make a name off me
That's why...
I get it in 'til the sunrise (Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid
Number one hustler, getting money (Ayy)
Yo, Bu—I told you I had you, homeboy
Why you wanna count my money? (Ayy, yeah!)
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
Yo, 'Kon, I got you!
I'm so paid

She said, "Young, why your voice so hoarse?"
I just sound like money, baby, I should've been a Porsche (Vroom)
Paint look like a sugar-free Red Bull (Woo)
I'm so paid, you know I keep a pocket full (Haha)
And that's before the taxes
Took my whole gross net and hid it under my mattress (Damn)
I used to get bored and count twenties for practice (What?)
Paper therapy, we let that money relax us (Yeah)
Gold chains 'round my neck just like Michael Phelps
I made a killing in the water (Oh), kill them with the water (Oh)
Against all odds, and I will not stop (Will not stop)
They try and keep me on bottom, but I prefer the top (Yeahhh)
And my project chick, I moved her next to Joc
She said the house was too small, I moved an extra block (Haha)
So, baby, get your ass up, I need an extra block (Ayy)
I told her, "Do the speed limit and no extra stops"
And that's why... (That's why)
I get it in 'til the sunrise (Yeah! Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Yeah! Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid (Yeah)
Number one hustler, getting money (What's up? What's up?)
Why you wanna count my money? (Ayy)
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
You can't count it!
I'm so paid

I am the boss it only takes one call
For a driver to hit you up and drop you off, that's all
(Guess what?) I won't be taking that fall
Homie, I got cake, that's what I'm paying them for
Haha, ain't that funny?
‘Cause niggas, they want war but ain't got money
‘Cause I've seen them all talking until they start gunning
Quicker than Usain Bolt, the fastest thing running
Yeah, Akon, Weezy (Jeezy!)
Black Royals holdin' down Jersey (Jersey)
Devine making sure we getting it up front
My little brother Bu got that vision, baby
I get it in 'til the sunrise (Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid (Yeah)
Number one hustler, getting money (Ayy)
Why you wanna count my money? (Ayy)
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all, you see
I'm so paid (Sheesh!)

Ah-em, Big Money Weezy
White wife-beater with the Sig underneath it
How do I feel? Bitch, I feel undefeated
Snap my fingers, disappear from the precinct, yeah
I'm ballin', we ball out
Ball 'til we fall until the ball bounce
I send some niggas with guns to y'all house
Only to find out you live in a dollhouse, damn!
But I thought you was tough, though
We carry choppers on our necks; call it "cutthroat"
We bury cowards on the set that they come from
We know magic, turn weed smoke to gun smoke
We! Bomb first when we ride
You! In a hearse when you ride (Ayy, ayy)
I put my shoe down, baby
And I'm holding down Young Mula, baby
That's why...

I get it in 'til the sunrise (Ayy)
Doing 90 in a 65 (Ayy)
Windows rolled down, screaming out
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm so paid

Ghetto, ghetto
Ghetto, ghetto livin'

These streets remind me of quicksand
When you're on it, you'll keep goin' down
And there's no one to hold on to
And there's no one to pull you out
You keep on fallin', no one can hear you callin'
So you end up self-destructin'
On the corner with the toolie on the waist line
Just got up out the thing doin' state time
Teeth marks on my back from the K-9
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine
‘Cause they said that I wouldn't make it
I remember like yesterday
Holdin' on to what God gave me

‘Cause that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
And eatin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto)
Ghetto, that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
And eatin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto, ghetto)
No need to cherish luxuries
‘Cause everything come and go
Even the life that you have is borrowed
‘Cause you're not promised tomorrow
So live your life as if every day is gon' be your last
Once you've moved forward
You can't go back just to remove your past
‘Cause you gotta be willin' to pray
Yes, there gotta be, there gotta be a better way
Yes, you gotta be willin' to pray
‘Cause there gotta be, there gotta be a better day
Whoever said that the struggle would stop today?
A lot a niggas dead or locked away
Teenage women growin' up with AIDS

‘Cause that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, eatin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto)
Ghetto, that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, eatin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto, ghetto)
Gun shots every night in the (ghetto)
Crooked cops on sight in the (ghetto)
Everyday is a fight in the (ghetto)
Oh oh oh oh oh (ghetto livin')
Got kids to feed in the (ghetto)
Sellin' coke and weed in the (ghetto)
Everyday somebody bleed in the (ghetto)
Oh oh oh oh oh (ghetto livin')

‘Cause that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, eatin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto)

Locked up, they won't let me out
And I had a long day in court, shit stress me out
Won't give me a bail, they can't get me out
Now I'm heading to the County, gotta do a bid here
I used to living luxurious, I don't wanna live here
The walls is gray, the clothes is orange
The phones is broke, the food is garbage
Lotta niggas is living with these circumstances
S.P.'s the same, I still merk your mans-es
Drug money to rap money, work advances
Niggas ran and told, I should've merked to Kansas
Got popped for a murder attempt
Knock me on D-Block when I was burnin' the hemp
Had a brick in the stash
Hope they don't take it to a further extent
Locked up and they won't let me out
When I hit my cellblock, niggas know the dread be out

I'm steady tryin' to find a motive
Why do what I do?
The freedom ain't getting no closer
No matter how far I go
My car is stolen, no registration
The cops patrollin'
And now they done stopped me
And I get locked up
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up; they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out

Heading up town to re-up
Back with a couple ki's
The corner block's on fire
Undercovers dressed as fiends
Making so much money
Product's moving fast
Put away the stash
As I sold the last bag
Fucked around and got locked up

They won't let me out
They won't let me out
My nigga I'm locked up; they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
Now that I'm locked up I rep two sets so
I'ma Ryde or Die and stay D-Blocked up
Two toothbrushes up, whoever want it with P
When I walk by, nigga, get up
‘Cause I'm locked up, they can't get me out
I smoke a stick of haze when they stress me out
Go and hit the bar when the wrecks be out
Can't wait for the day when they let me out

‘Cause visitation no longer comes by
It seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is getting empty
My cellmates getting food without me
I can't wait to get out
And move forward with my life
Got a family that loves me
And wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up

They won't let me out
They won't let me out
Oh! I'm locked up; they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
My nigga I'm locked up, they won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
‘Cause I'm locked up
Where's my lawyer?
Get me out of here
Baby, I'm locked up
Where's my niggas on the block?
Tell them I'm locked up
I'm locked up
Can you please accept my phone call?8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I had to get P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newport's cause I'm due in court
For an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man
(you betta have your gat in hand cause man)
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin

Our lifestyles be close captioned
Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
In the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture or the
Repercutions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious

Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin
Gun shots every night in the (ghetto)
Crooked cops on sight in the (ghetto)
Every day is a fight in the (ghetto)
(oh oh oh oh oh) (ghetto)
Got kids to feed in the (ghetto)
Selling coke and weed in the (ghetto)
Every day somebody bleed in the (ghetto)
(oh oh oh oh oh) (ghetto)

I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, Who's next?
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin back, countin double digit thousand stacks
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead

Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin
Cause thats the life when your
Living in the (ghetto) oh
Eating in the (ghetto) or
Sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto)
Thats the life when ur
Living in the (ghetto)oh
Eating in the (ghetto) or
Sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)
It's a funny thing, I kinda realized how powerful 2pac and I was. You kno wha I'm saying cuz Pac is a strong dude yo. I kno him. We two individual people, we waged a coastal beef. But even tho we were going through our drama I would never wish death on nobody cuz there ain't no comin back3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It’s a dirty job but somebody’s gotta do it
I see you working go and put your back into it
Baby I’mma watch… you, just keep it moving
You know exactly what you’re doing
So go and do your dirty work
Go and do your dirty work

Ass up
Face down
Perfect body and she lay it to the ground
Stacked up
Waist down
Wanted to throw it like a pitcher on a mound
I see them niggas reaching for their last dollar
Asking dumb questions like “baby, do you model?”
Promising everything, hopin’ that they follow
Praying for America, I hope they down with Harry Potter
Isn’t she the most beautiful thing that you ever saw?
Don’t she deserve the biggest diamond ring that you ever bought?


Gettin’ down dirty, gettin’ down dirty, gettin’ down...
Go and do your dirty work
Gettin’ down dirty, gettin’ down dirty, gettin’ down...
Back up
Shake down
Just give it all to me and do it right now
Shack up
Take down
Just wanna love you without looking' like a clown
You’re the best that ever did it
You’re killing everybody, how're you supposed to make a living?
Yes I know you hear it all when they trickin'
I can hear them niggas saying you too pretty to be strippin'
Isn’t she the most beautiful thing that you ever saw?
Don’t she deserve the biggest diamond ring that you ever bought?



More money, more problems, less rest
If it’s about a dollar later, shorty, let’s invest
Drop the top, pull the whip out like a hamstring
You on your job but I’m a boss, I keep my hands clean
Keep grabbin' all up on my coat
I’m lettin' out all of this smoke
I’m thrown' money in the air
I’m buying' bottles for my folks
And then I’m coming back for more
‘Cause you know all my favorite features
I'mma roll some of this reefer
You can call me Young Khalifa

Everything I have, everything I own
All my mistakes man, you already know
I wanna be free, I wanna be free

From Senegal, West Africa
To St. Louis, Missouri
Thanks to Katherine Dunham
For giving my pops his glory
He came down with his drum
And a dream to change the world
In a free uplifting world
And that's all he ever want
Mom came a little after
Gave birth to my brother
Then all of the pressure
Made 'em fight one another
See the pain would never last
Did the best with what they had
He knew the world was out for grabs
And he searched to find his

Freedom (x4)
Everything I have, everything I own
All my mistakes man, you already know
I wanna be free, I wanna be free
So I search to find my
Freedom (x4)
Everything I have, everything I own
All my mistakes girl, you already know
I wanna be free, I wanna be free, yea
As a kid I never knew
I'd have to hustle just to make it through
So I found myself skipping school
Cause the girls don't think I'm cool
And because of that I didn't care
Whether or not I went to jail
I just wanna be treated fair
Cause that's all I ever knew
Telling me I need to slow down
Cause everybody in the whole town
Cause they know how I get down
Foreigner from another town
Can you believe we still around?
After so many hit the ground
And we ain't gone stop now
Until we get that

Freedom (x4)
Everything I have, everything I own
All my mistakes man, you already know
I wanna be free, I wanna be free
Won't stop 'til I find my

I wanna be free, I wanna be free
If you wanna be free, and the land is drug free
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna be free, from all your misery
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna be free, with plenty money
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna be free, just praise G O D
Put your hands up, put your hands up

Konvict, Konvict – ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Go gangsta – ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Go gangsta, keep boppin' (Block Boy up!)
Rock with me, let's get this bitch poppin' (Upfront!)
Go gangsta, keep boppin' (Geah!)
Like back when a nigga was clockin'

See nowadays it seems like e'rybody wanna be killas
Gorillas gettin' high off their weed and liquor
You die quicker, paramedics drive back slow to the hospital
You get pronounced dead at 4 to the hospital
Stop frontin' when you know you won't pull nothin'
First nigga to retreat when the tools bustin'
Playin' with death is bad for your health
All your homeboys gone, you the last one left
Now, they hearts beatin' but these niggas be scared
The real ones are all locked up or dead
Nowadays you can't find a good connect
But if you do, you might be the feds, so—

I don't know you, you don't know me
You don't know the history I got on these streets
Only if you see what my eyes have seen
Then you'll understand why I'm surrounded by G's
If you owe me or we got beef
I recommend you reach for your heat and don't freeze
Pause for a minute, guaranteed you gon' bleed
‘Cause that's how we was raised growin' up in these streets
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Rock with me, let's get this bitch poppin'
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Like back when a nigga was clockin'

See it's hard to be good but easy to do evil
And I ain't really into meetin' with new people
Just put the money in the bag and I'll leave you
The weed, coke, Lambo or Evisu
You make a hundred dollars, to the streets you made a G
When you coppin' O's, they swearin' you move ki's
Feds gettin' close and the rats seein' cheese
And they tryna find them birds, not the ones that sleep in trees
We got that bird, we got that blue
You want short skirts? We got that too
Whatever you need, my nigga, show me the cheese
And baby, you can believe that we can make that brew

I don't know you, you don't know me
You don't know the history I got on these streets
Only if you see what my eyes have seen
Then you'll understand why I'm surrounded by G's
If you owe me or we got beef
I recommend you reach for your heat and don't freeze
Pause for a minute, guaranteed you gon' bleed
‘Cause that's how we was raised growin' up in these streets
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Rock with me, let's get this bitch poppin'
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Like back when a nigga was clockin'

Streets been watchin' and they don't blink
Sidewalk got ears, the pavement don't sleep
The fittest will survive, the weak just don't eat
E'rybody in between just gettin' a rap sheet
The streets been watchin' and they don't blink
Sidewalk got ears, the pavement don't sleep
The fittest will survive, the weak just don't eat
E'rybody in between just gettin' a rap sheet

I don't know you, you don't know me
You don't know the history I got on these streets
Only if you see what my eyes have seen
Then you'll understand why I'm surrounded by G's
If you owe me or we got beef
I recommend you reach for your heat and don't freeze
Pause for a minute, guaranteed you gon' bleed
‘Cause that's how we was raised growin' up in these streets
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Rock with me, let's get this bitch poppin'
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Like back when a nigga was clockin'
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Rock with me, let's get this bitch poppin'
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Like back when a nigga was clockin'

See it's hard to be good but easy to do evil
And I ain't really into meetin' with new people
See it's hard to be good but easy to do evil
And I ain't really into meetin' with new people
See it's hard to be good but easy to do evil
And I ain't really into meetin' with new people
See it's hard to be good…5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I know they wanna come and separate us
But they can't do us nothin'
You're the one I want and I'ma continue lovin'
Cause you're considered wife and I'm considered husband
And I'ma always be there for you
And either way you look at it, I ain't goin' nowhere from my muffin'
Cause she gonna hold it down, can't nobody tell her nothin'
That got the kind of love that always make a better fussin'
And that's what gets me closer to you

And no one know why I'm into you
'Cause you'll never know what it's like to walk in our shoes
And no one know the things we've been through
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through
That's why we'll break through

And I don't care what they say, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I'm gonna be with you

Seems like every day that go by, things are gettin' harder
Wanna be the one that give you the whole enchilada
Cause I know what my baby like, I lean you on that Prada
You ain't got to match with the shoes
All about knowin' you, I'm into doin' things to keep her longer
Stickin' together forever, watch you grow stronger
That's the way it has to be, everythin' proper
Keepin' it always true
And no one know why I'm into you
Cause you'll never know what it's like to walk in our shoes
And no one know the things we've been through
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through
That's why we'll break through

And I don't care what they say, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I'm gonna be with you

You are everythin' in my life, see the joy you bring
And ain't no one I compare you to
And I know that you will never walk away from me no matter what
And that's why I plan to do the same thing for you
And I want you to know

And I don't care what they say, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I'm gonna be with you
And I don't care what they say, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do, I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you, I'm gonna be with you3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I can't wait
I can't wait

I think of you
When the morning comes and the night time goes away (all day)
Don't you ever think that we won't be okay (no way)
There is nothin' stoppin' me from lovin' you
Touchin' and rubbin' and kissin' and huggin' you
What's this feelin' taking over, me?
Baby that's love and it ain't no stoppin' it
I don't know as far as the eyes can see
Pick up the pace and it ain't no droppin' it
Always forever I'll be by your side
You're my Bonnie, I'm your Clyde
That's the way that it's gonna be
I'm in love with you and you in love with me

(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait)
I can't believe
That someone like you will love me endlessly (forever)
If this goes our way my love will always be (eternally)
You have set my mind, my love, my heart so free
Together forever however just you and me
What's this feelin' taking over me
Baby that's love and it ain't no stoppin' it
I don't know as far as the eyes can see
Pick up the pace and it ain't no droppin' it
Always forever I'll be by your side
You're my Bonnie, I'm your Clyde
Cause that's the way that it's gonna be
I'm in love with you and you're in love with me

(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait)

To have you right next to me here by my side (I can't wait)
To kiss and caress you girl while I'm holdin' you tight (I can't wait)
Can't imagine life without you, it just ain't right (I can't wait)
I got a whole lot of lovin', and you gon' get it tonight
(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait)
