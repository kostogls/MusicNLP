Word up son, word
Yeah, to all the killers and a hundred dollar billers
Yo I got the phone thing, know I'm sayin', keep your eyes open
For real niggas who ain't got no feelings
Keep your eyes open
No doubt, no doubt son, I got this, I got this
Just watch my back, I got the front, yo
Check it out now
Word up, say it to them niggas, check this out it's a murder

I got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous
You heard of us, official Queensbridge murderers
The Mobb comes equipped for warfare, beware
Of my crime family who got 'nough shots to share
For all of those who wanna profile and pose
Rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nose bone
You all alone in these streets, cousin
Every man for they self in this land we be gunnin'
And keep them shook crews runnin', like they supposed to
They come around, but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face, you're in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they whole body laced up
With bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words, man, and you will get touched
You can put your whole army against my team and
I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'
Your simple words just don't move me
You're minor, we're major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight, my gunshots'll make you levitate
I'm only nineteen, but my mind is old
And when the things get for real, my warm heart turns cold
Another nigga deceased, another story gets told
It ain't nothin' really, ayo Dun, spark the Philly
So I can get my mind off these yellow-backed niggas
Why they still alive? I don't know, go figure
Meanwhile back in Queens the realness and foundation
If I die, I couldn't choose a better location
When the slugs penetrate, you feel a burnin' sensation
Gettin' closer to God in a tight situation now
Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you
Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look
Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
So some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one

For every rhyme I write it's twenty-five to life
Yo, it's a must, in gats we trust, safeguardin' my life
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
Queensbridge and we don't play
I don't got time for your petty-thinkin' mind
Son, I'm bigger than those
Claimin' that you pack heat, but you're scared to hold
And once the smoke clears, you'll be left with one in your dome
Thirteen years in the projects—my mentality is what, kid?
You talk a good one, but you don't want it
Sometimes I wonder, do I deserve to live?
Or am I gonna burn in Hell for all the things I did?
No time to dwell on that, 'cause my brain reacts
Front if you want, kid, lay on your back
I don't fake jax, kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid, you out of line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sippin', E&J got my mind flippin'
I'm buggin', diggin' my ways out of holes by hustlin'
Get that loot, kid, you know my function
'Cause long as I'm alive, I'ma live illegal
And once I get on, I'ma put on all my peoples
React quick, spit lyrics like MACs, I hit your dome up
When I roll up, don't be caught sleepin', 'cause I'm creepin'
Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
(We live the life that of diamonds)
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
So some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one

To all the villains and a hundred dollar billers
To real brothers who ain't got no feelings
G-yeah, the whole Bridge
Queens get the money
41st side, keepin' it real, you know
Queens get the money

Yeah, sendin' this one out
To my man, Killer B
No doubt indeed
Where that weed?
Nomsayin'?
That old real shit

There's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from
You could run, but you can't hide forever
From these streets that we done took
You walkin' with your head down, scared to look
You shook, ‘cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady
By the MAC one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home with
My skin is thick, ‘cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul
Before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
Into the drama I built
And all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed
Put us together, it's like mixin' vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord, forgive me
The Hennessy got me not knowin' how to act
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
Or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black
That I can't say so it's left a untold fact
Until my death, my goal's to stay alive
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(Thug life, we still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

I'm trapped, in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough
Y'know, when the dough get low the jewels go
But never that, as long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks
No doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
Five-oh lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
Niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I live a world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin when he got bagged
That fucked me up, God, but shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples
When you're upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
Hit with a two to four is difficult
Wild on the streets, I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, ‘cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get
I'm stayin' in the projects forever
Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
If beef, we never separate and pull together
When worse comes to worst, my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot—fuck lookin' cute!
I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
Puffin L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
In the Bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell
You better realize
Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(Thug life, we still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

Open your eyes and get wise
Look alive, in '95, word up
Hypnotic thug life, get that ass paralyzed

Yo, the saga begins, begin war
I draw first blood, be the first to set it off
My cause, tap all jaws, lay down laws
We takin' what's yours, we do jux, rush the doors
Here come the D's, time to make breeze and guns toss
In full force, my team'll go at your main source
My 9 Taurus hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up, we lock shit
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts 'fore niggas pop shit
Yo, nigga Noyd, what's the topic?
Nine pound, we rocked it
'96, strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate, my team'll glow like radiation
With no time for patient or complication
Let's get it done right, my clique airtight
Trapped in a never-ending gunfight
So niggas lose stripes or lose life
Jail niggas sendin' kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked
Finish 'em off, well-done meat
Then send .22 slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

Ayo, it's Hell on Earth
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one-time
I ain't gotta tell you
It's right in front of your eyes
Ayo, it's Hell on Earth
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one-time
I ain't gotta tell you
Yo, it's right in front of your eyes
We rep the QBC, nigga, rep yours, it's all love
Milli' stacked down, heavily guarded by hollow-tip slug
Then crack down on wannabe thugs
Adapt to gat sound and bow down
Slow the fuck up, see how my foul now
Articulate, hittin' body parts to start shiftin' shit
Never hesitant, it's the rap game unlimited
Sign my roster, we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminisce twenty years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me, go against the grain, you better hit me
Leggin' me or robbin' me, niggas better body me
‘Cause it's a small world and niggas talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin' you out in pictures
‘Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa-hatin' me
All that bullshit is just makin' me
More the better to concentrate on gettin' cheddar
If shorty set you up, you better dead her
I told you, shape and mold you, son you, then I hold you
Like a pimp, mind control you, double-edge blow you
In the B-I like I'm supposed to, the clique is coastal
International, you local
Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, son, I solved 'em
Pulled him in my world and evolved him to chaos
Walk the beat like around the way cops the average pitstop
QB City, Godfather Pt III
Gotti, Gambino, and Ty Nitty
Scarface, rest in peace
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line (Front line)
And the enemy is one-time (One-time)
I ain't gotta tell you
Ayo, it's right in front of your eyes
Hell on Earth
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line (Front line)
And the enemy is one-time (One-time)
I ain't gotta tell you
Ayo, it's right in front of your eyes

Yo, the heavy metal king, hold big shit with spare clips
You see eclipse when the MAC spit, your top got split
Layin' dead with open eyes, close his eyelids
Turn off his lights, switch to darkness
It's deep in the abyss of street life
Blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
You's the wild child, Kicko turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power, leave my mark on this planet
The phantom of crime rap, niggas is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth like Guinness
P.O.W. niggas is found M.I.A.
We move like special forces, Green Beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in '89, the same way
The God P walk with a limp, see
But simply, to simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me, you must be bent, G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it's full for so long 'cause I don't waste shit
You properly hit, blood in your mouth so you could taste it
Quiet is kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs claimin' that they gonna rob the Mobb when they see us
I tell you what, black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take these missiles
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryna make cream and that's that
Whatever it takes, however it gots to go down
Four mics on stage, a motherfuckin' four-pound
Speakers leakin' out sound and niggas leakin' on the ground
I could truly care less, the God gon' get his regardless
Blow-for-blow, let's find out who hit hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself, see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point, never disregard shit
Or forget the essence from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the birds (Nigga)
Live up to my words, if I got beef, niggas comin' in herds (Nigga)
We flush through, your clique get purged (Word up)30EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Get at me, niggas wanna clap me
Snitches wanna rat me? Put it right where they back be
Keep my Dunns close to me, enemies even closer
Sendin' kites with the Motorolas, yo
Give 'em the cold shoulder with a hollow-tip to match
Bad apple outta the batch, obsessed with gats
Since a little dude, eating niggas food buck-fifty's
Niggas can kill me but they comin' wit me
How about that, send the Queen Bee to attack
Only a fly bitch like that can leave em relaxed
Rock 'em to sleep, make 'em think the drama is dead

My Brooklyn style speak for itself
Like a wrestler, another notch under my belt
The embezzler, chrome treasurer
The U-N-O competitor
I'm ten steps ahead of ya
I'm a leader, y'all on some followin' shit
Comin' in this game on some modeling shit
Bitches suck cock just to get to the top
I put a hundred percent in every line I drop
It's the Q to the B, with the M-O, B-B

Yo, I could never get enough of it, yo that's my shit
I need that shit, to boost my adrenaline
Yo, rock that shit
That real life shit
Makes bitches wanna thug it
Makes the projects love it
We come through like, fuck it
Y'all want problems, pursue it, let's do it
Infamous Mobb bosses, check out the portrait
At the round table, my Dunn speaking with his Twin ghost
It's gangster how we rock, while you watch
Attracted to our style, this is how we get down
With big jewelry and big guns
We get busy, it get grizzly, beat niggas bloody
Twist niggas fronting, get to running
Fore the mens get to dumping, the fans get to thumping
M-O-B-B got the whole spot jumping
When my niggas step in the place
Damn, you gotta love it
Yo, it's the real shit

We done seen it all, and been through it all, yo
Let y'all niggas know right now
Word to mother, for real, for real
That shit is the truth, I'm not lyin'

I put my lifetime in between the paper's lines
I'm the quiet storm nigga who fight rhyme
P, yeah, you heard of him, but I ain't concerned with them
Nigga, I pop more guns than you holdin' 'em
Make my route while the sun's out and scold your men
Unload ten in broad daylight, get right
Fuck your life! Hop on my '98 dirt bike
You try to stop mines from growin'
I'll make your blood stop flowin'
Take affirmative action, to any ass if he askin'
Now here come the MAC-10
You's a dick blower, tryin' to speak the Dunn language
What the drilly with that though? It ain't bangin'
You hooked on Mobb-phonics, Infamous-bonics
Lyin' to the Pop Dog like you got it
You ain't no wildin' out for the Knife-Fist thrower
Rusty shank holder, we live this shit
‘Cause it's the real shit, shit to make 'em feel shit
Lump 'em in the club shit
Have you wildin' out when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD, ‘cause it's never enough

Yo, the P rock forty inch cables, drinkin' white label
My chain hang down to my dick, my piece bang glass tables
Diamonds and guns before the fame, duke
A nigga like me hold TEC's, are you the same too?
Goin' through the emotions of gun holdin'
Long shotgun's down my pants leg, limpin'
Killa B, you still livin', even my pops too
He taught me how to shoot when I was seven
I used to bust shots crazy
I couldn't even look because the loud sound used to scare me
I love my pops for that, I love my niggaty Black
I'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left
And through all of that, a nigga ain't scared of death
All y'all brand new niggas just scared to death
I spent too many nights sniffin' coke, gettin' right
Wastin' my life, now I'm tryin' to make things right
Grand open some gates, invest in the rag business
Do things for the kids, the little Dunns
Build a jungle gym behind the crib, so they can enjoy youth
CBR's and VCR's, ATV's and big screen TV's
Nigga, please, don't make me have to risk my freedom
We worked our whole life for this, you get your shit beat in
‘Cause it's the real shit, shit to make 'em feel shit
Lump 'em in the club shit
Have you wildin' out when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD, ‘cause it's never enough

It go one, two, three to the fourth
That nigga P-Double got that shit for y'alls
Peoples to rock to, stirrin' up pots of brew
In hell's kitchen, I chef the impossible
To serve hot plates all across the Unified States
Sit down and sup with the top rap reps
We the streets that's watchin', boy, move diligent
You better walk like a nigga on a tightrope do
Infamous first infantry, first division, fourth mission
First assignment, give 'em that shit they been missin'
My new edition's way bitchin'
Those that listen get addicted to my diction
Fuck rhymes, I write prescriptions for your disease
Generic raps just not potent like P's
One-thousand one-hundred CC's on the throttle
I peel off, chest naked on Katanas
Spaghetti head Mobb niggas is full bred
Fully-blown melanin tone
I rock skeleton bone shirts and verses
But thirst for worse beats
So I can put more product out on the street
Get respect and love all across the board
We've been adored for keepin' it raw
Nothin' less or more, I score every time for sure
While the rest of y'all niggas just nil
‘Cause it's the real shit, shit to make 'em feel shit
Lump 'em in the club shit
Have you wildin' out when you bump this

As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together, son, your beef is mines

Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list
Know wha'mean, Hav? Situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya
And leave your corpse for the cops to discover
While I be pimpin' in the Range Rover, all jewelled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes tryin' to knock me and lock me
But I be on the low sippin' Asti Spumante
Niggas tried to creep on the side of my Jeep
Stuck the heat through the window, rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack, it was a small thing really, yeah
But keep lettin' them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm out of town, one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours and your team's inferior
You wanna bust caps, I get all up in your area
Kidnap your children, make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus, the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got cheese in my pocket, hit off my main squeeze
Push back the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
Through the butter-soft leather upholstery
But mostly, keep the gat closely 'cause niggas wanna toast me
Aiyo, I gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences
Count all my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the gat and let my nine serve purpose
Sling, do my thing, organized fiend service
Tryin' to make a mill is stress, you know the deal
So we sling krills, get your cap peeled, 'cause everythin' is real
Cuz, I wanna chill, laid up in a jacuzzi
Sippin' bubbly with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort, get caught
Dead up in New York, my brain is packed with criminal thoughts
Get your life lost, never found again, my friend
Mission completed, watch you drop in less than ten
On my road to the riches, hittin' snitches off with mad stitches
Your last restin' place'll be a ditch, kid
No one can stop me; try, your style's sloppy
You wanna be me, you're just an imitation copy
My theme is all about makin' the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin' phat whips and livin' comfortably

As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
A drug dealer's dream:
Stash C.R.E.A.M., keys on a triple beam
500 SL green, '95 nickle gleam
Condominium, thug dressed like a gentleman
Tailor-made ostrich, Chanel for my woman friend
Murderin', numbers on your head while I'm burglarin'
Shank is servin' 'em
What's up to all my niggas swervin' in New York metropolis
The 'Bridge brings apocalypse
Shoot at the clouds, feels like the Holy Beast is watchin' us
Mad man, my sanity is goin' like a hourglass
Gun inside my bad hand I sliced tryna bag grams
I got hoes that used to milk you, niggas who could've killed you
Is down with my ill crew of psychos
Nas Escobar movin' on your weak production
Pumpin' corruption in the third world, we just bustin'

Hold up, and analyze the wildcats slang cracks
They swing in Ac's, the new routines, be my eyes black's
Playin' corners, glancin' all up in your cornea
Corner ya, seen cats snatch monies up on ya
But late night, candlelight fiend with a crack pipe
It's only right, feelin' higher than an airplane, right
Word, yo, I wanna get this money then blow
Take my time, blast a nine, if you front you go
Sip beers, the German ones, hand my guns to sons
Shaolin and Queensbridge, we robbin' niggas for fun
But still, write my will out to my seeds then build
Mahalia sing a tale, but the real we still kill
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together, son, your beef is mines

Uhhhh, laid back, word up
Jus' bless 'em with the bulletproof
Mobb Deep, Nas, Chef creation
For yo' nation, yeah!36EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The most violent of the violentest crimes we give life to
If these Queensbridge kids don't like you
We bring drama of the worst kind of enemies
Your first time will be your last Earth memories
It's only your own fault, I gave you fair warning
Beware of killer kids who don't care
Unaware fools will be dealt with in time
It ain't a mystery how I form the words in rhyme
In nineteen hundred and ninety square
All shook niggas is supposed to have fear
Tryna get a piece of this pie, we don't share
Prepare for the worst 'cause I been there
Try to keep a positive mind and walk a straight line don't work
So niggas is forced to do dirt
And God made dirt, so this dirt won't hurt
If I listen to the lessons and the rules I learnt
On these streets for nineteen years and not leaving
My first priority's to reach twenty one breathing
Forever beef, nobody will ever be even
So I grab the heat before breezing
Lost in this foul mind state I can't keep straight thinkin'
But I keep my eyes on the Earth without blinking
It's hard to be a man in this land of the venom
Any man try to front he get slugs in him
Because...
He ain't a crook son (son)
He just a shook one (shook one)
We live the life that of diamonds and guns
And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds
Some niggas get shot, locked down and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones (shook ones)
He ain't a crook son
He just a shook one (shook one)

For every rhyme I write it's 25 to life
To all my peoples in the Bridge know what I'm talking 'bout, right
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
'Cause Queens niggas don't play
I don't got time for the he say she say I'm bigger than that
Claiming that you pack a gat but you scared to get locked
Once you get upon the Island change your ways and stop
Thirteen  years in the projects of hard times I've lived in
Wake up in the morning thank God I'm still living
Sometimes I wonder do I deserve to live
Or I am going to burn in hell for all the shit I did?
No time to dwell on that 'cause my brain reacts
Front if you want nigga
Lay on your back, I don't fake jacks kid
You know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid you outta line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition mission
I'm strictly sipping E&J like got my mind flippin'
I'm bugging digging my ways out of holes by hustlin'
Get that loot kid
You know my motherfucking function
'Cause long as I'm alive I'ma live illegal
And once I get on I'ma put on all my peoples
React quick, spit lyrics like MACs I hit
Your dome up, when I roll up
Don't be caught sleeping 'cause I'm creeping
You just a shook one

He ain't a crook son
He just a shook one
We live the life that of diamonds and guns
And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds
Some niggas get shot, locked down and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones (shook ones)
He ain't a crook son
He just a shook one (shook one)
We live the life that of diamonds and guns
And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds
Some niggas get shot, locked down and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones (shook ones)
He ain't a crook son (crook son)
He just a shook one (shook one)19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(Once again)
Once again

It's the infamous back in the house once again
Live the life, that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems
The Mobb got the bomb, run out and tell a friend
Drop a gem on 'em
It's the infamous back in the house once again
Live the life, that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems
The Mobb got the bomb, run out and tell a friend
Drop a gem on 'em

Sick and tired, ugly fake crooks need to retire
They got you gassed, take a match and smack fire out your
Maggot ass, Havoc represent for the QBC
Smoke that ass like a loosie, though I need to quit
Fuck it, I love it
Like a cloud over the projects, your game, I'm above it
It's combat, gats, bangers and all that
You's a small cat, whatever you on, get off that
I mention nothin' but the real shit, presentin'
The hollow-tip crew, 41st side convention
Stride full, you half-steppin'
Like a fresh TEC out of the box, yo, niggas, I'm testin'
That's no question, bitch-ass, have you confessin'
Like a DT, left in state of depression
You under pressure, in tag, no doubt catcher
The snitch-snatcher, shooken with asthma, you Casper
You yell my name, that's only givin' me props
Plus the fans that you got wonderin' what's got you hot
It's Tu-Not, knocked out the box and got rocked
Got raped on the Island, you officially got
Kick that thug shit, Vibe magazine on some love shit
Keep it real, kid, 'cause you don't know who you fuckin' with
It's the infamous back in the house once again
Live the life, that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems

Drop a gem on 'em, son
You know I got jewels, infinite, son
Yo

Yeah, likewise, tired of rap guys that's faggots
Yeah, P'll shut eyes and swole up your whole outside
I baptize, niggas get wet, hit up your backside
Get claptized and set straight, put on your head straight
Watch out for these upstate cats
Be leery of New Yiddy niggas with gats with the wall on they back
Rikers Island flashbacks of the house you got scufted in
You would think that gettin' your head shot's enough, but then
Now you wanna go at my team
Must have been drunk when you wrote that shit
Too bad you had to did it to your own self
My rebellion, retaliate
I had the whole New York state
Aimin' at your face at the gate
Bottom line off top soon as you came through
Shots flew, don't even know the half of my crew
I got a hundred strong-arm niggas ready to rock your shit
Clocks tick, your days are numbered in low digits
You look suspicious, suspect niggas is bitches
Get chopped up, Grade A meat, somethin' delicious
And laced back up, two G's worth of stitches
To reconstruct your face and learn how to speak again
My mob's like a bunch of wild Puerto Ricans
With bangers the size of African spears, it's warfare
In the arena, we turn arenas into house of horrors
It's Terrordome, when you see my clique, you need to run behind shit
You got a gat, you better find it
And use that shit, think fast and get reminded
Of robberies in Manhattan, you know what happened
Sixty G's worth of gun clappin'
Who shot ya?
You probably screamed louder than an opera
New York got ya
Now you wanna use my Mobb as a crutch
What you think, you can't get bucked again?
Once again
Back in the house once again
Live the life, that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems
The Mobb got the bomb, run out and tell a friend
Drop a gem on 'em
It's the infamous back in the house once again
Live the life, that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems
The Mobb got the bomb, run out and tell a friend

Aiyo, Queens get the money, long time no cash
I'm caught up in the hustle when the guns go blast
The fool retaliated so I had to think fast
Pull out my heat first, he pull out his heat last
Now, who the fuck you think is living to this day?
I'm tryna tell these young niggas crime don't pay
They looked at me and said, "Queens niggas don't play
Do your thing, I'll do mine, kid, stay outta my way"
It's type hard tryna survive in New York state
But can't stop 'til I'm eating off a platinum plate
Po-po comes around and tries to relocate me
Lock me up forever but they can't deflate me
'Cause having cash is highly addictive
Especially when you're used to have no money to live with
I pause, step back, look at my life as a whole
Ain't no love, it seems the devil done stole my soul
I'm out for delfia, selfia, P's not helping ya
I'm tryna get this Lexus up, plus a cellular
Yo, Big Noyd! (What up, cousin?) I can't cope
With all these crab niggas tryna shorten my rope

Yo, it's the R-A-double-P-E-R N-O-Y-D
Niggas can't fuck with me!
Coming straight outta QB, pushing the Infiniti
You ask can I rip it constantly? Mentally?
Definitely, to the death of me, come and test me
Trust me, nigga can't touch me if he snuffed me
So bust me, you're gonna have to, 'cause I'mma blast you
My lyrical like a miracle, ill spiritual
I'm born with it, I'm getting on with it
And I'mma have it 'til I'm fucking dead and gone with it
'Cause I'm a what? Composer of hardcore, a lyrical destructor
Don't make me buck ya, 'cause I'm a wild muthafucker
You know I flow, you know my steelo
Even pack my gat when I go to see my P.O
Jump out my hooptie, pass my gat and my lucci
To my shorty, in case my P.O. try to troop me
To the Island, and if I start wilding
Flipping on niggas walking around with the nice gold medallions
But she didn't violate me, so I escaped, see
Back to Queens, pumping the fiends, making more cream
Know what I mean? I'm a natural born hustler
Won't try to cut ya, pull out my .44 and bust ya
Yo, ain't no time for faking jacks
'Cause brothers that fake jacks get laid on their backs
The streets is real, can't roll without steel
I feel how I feel 'cause I was born to kill
Do what I gotta to eat a decent meal, brothers is starving
Don't try to find a job, son, it's all about robbing
So don't be alarmed when we come through
We supposed to, if you opposed to, get your face blown, dude
Off the map, 'cause I react, attack
A brother wasn't blessed with wealth, so I act like that
Drug dealing, only mess with shorties that's appealing
I'm fronting on the world once I start 4-wheeling
'Cause back on the 41st Side, we do it right
Sipping E&J, getting bent all night
Yo, who that? I never seen him in my whole life
Step to his business 'cause it's only right
Po-po ain't around so I grab my pound
Money retaliated so I hit the ground
My life is on the line, gotta hold my projects down
Can't see myself getting bodied by a clown
Ass nigga that ain't even from my town
Hit him up in the chest, now he's laying man down
Jetted up from under the benches, I started hearing sirens
I stopped firing, to cut ass like a diamond
Jetted to the crib piece, what a relief
Stashed the heat then proceeded to peep
Out the window, call my son, "Yo, son, we got beef"
But no question, money had a problem so I solved him
I got my mind on a stick-up, now it's time to get paid
Thinking of ways to take loot already made
There's crime in the air, ain't no time to be afraid
Give me yours or get laid
Give up the goods or get sprayed

I got lots of love, for my crew that is
No love for them other crews and rival kids
All them out-of-town niggas know what time it is
And if they don't, they need to buy a watch, word up
Caught up in the crossfire, get theyself hurt up
While I be sipping gin straight in a plastic cup
On a park bench on 12th Street, my whole crew's famous
You tried to bust your gat and keep it real, but you nameless
First of all, slow down, you on the wrong route
Let me put you on your feet and show you what's it all about
The street life ain't nothing to play with, no jokes, no games, kid
For years, I been doing the same shit
Just, drinking liquor, doing bids
Extorting crack heads, and sticking up the stick-up kids24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You know what I'm sayin'?
I wanna say what's up to my man
Louie you know he's still here
Drop this one for you, you know
And for those who don't know
The 41st Side

I keep it real, pack steel like my man YG
When a fool try to play me wet 'em up then I'm Swayze
You must be crazy, kid
Ran, I never did
Forever wildin' that's how we live up in the Bridge
You just sit scared
Cock back the Gat then hit a nigga like a bid
25, nah, kid you gettin' life
Forever burnin' in hell, niggas is trife
It's the semi-auto, you can bring it on, yo
I'm pullin' out strippin' niggas just like a porno flick
I'm sick the Mobb rolls thick
Cross paths with my clique and get vic
I'm on some bullshit that's how I was raised, G
Each level is a stage
Have you slidin' down blades in pools of alcohol
Walk before you crawl
I'm in this to win this, you gonna take a fall
The Infamous Queensbridge, kid, we on the scene, kid
Creepin' on those who caught sleepin'
Don't ever do that I run with two macs
And plus my crew backs my every move
I choose givin' crews the blues
I'm open off the Dainy
Obey me or get sprayed with the sweeper
'Cause I'm my brothers keeper
The Grim Reaper holdin' with nothin' but big batters
And big heaters
Blow you three times leave a mark like Adidas
Jig you, I know how to fix you
Pretty boy niggas frontin' hard is the issue
Word to my unborn you get scolded
Old and molded when I get bent you get folded
Every rhyme is the truth that I must get 'cross
Put you right on your back, take it to the source
No doubt I'm stuck and I can't get out
Of this lifestyle, the 41st side get bent, run wild
The 41st side, two
You know how we do, violate, motherfucker
I'ma see you, with the Linden
It's the start of your endin'
Settin' it again and again
Yeah kid, its Big Time boy, 12th street representin' it
Big shout out to my man, Tear Gas, think, Lake whole crew kid
You knowhatI'msayin' couso? Richie Fraud known to leave ya scarred, give a big shoot out to my man Heavy L
Big Palms representing from the Goodfellas

Yo, it's the P. E. double push a Lex bubble in the winter
You can't come along only the hoes can enter
Told her to meet me at six on the hill at the center
Took her to the west way and bent her right over
Stay intoxicated, never sober
Faced it, violate and get lace'd
Why you wasting slugs? You ain't buckin' nothing
You better off buckin' yourself: you need to stop fronting
I used to drive an Ac and kept a Mac in the engine
Littles painted it black with crack sale intentions
To blow up the whole projects the Infamous
Our sons will grow up to be murderers and terrorists
It's the nigga in me, accompanied by the Cognac
You can ask around, don't fuck with the Mobb
I could've told you that, where you been at
You must have cut class
If it ain't me, another member of my crew will kick your ass (what what, what)
We do damage to limbs
In '91, stomping you out with black Timbs
Prodigy and the H.A.V.O.C. from the Q.B.C
Putting cowards where they're supposed to be
If I don't know your face then don't come close to me
I got too much beef for that
Drama in the 3rd degree
And to the kids you don't wanna be me
I'm up in the mix of action, where niggas wanna kill me
But it's the start of they ending, my man's lendin' me his Linden Forty-two shots depending
On whether or not the clip is full to the top
We busting caps non-stop, blazing
In all the shows and even at the hoes
(Nah, nah chill son)
What?
And it's the start of your ending
(word up yo, it's the start of niggas ending, youknowhatI'msayin?)
And it's the start of your motherfuckin' ending
(All y'all weak-ass crews that got drama with mines, you know what I'm sayin', It's the start of your ending, word up)
And it's the motherfuckin' start of the ending
(we know the fuck you is, you know what will happen)
(Recognize and realize)
41st side get bent, run wild

Yeah, about to get my thug on
The 41st side of things

I used to be in love with this bitch named E&J
Don't fuck with her no more, now I fuck with Tanqueray
Tanqueray introduced me to her first cousin Gold
(Yeah, that bitch)
Last name was English and the first name Olde
But Gold couldn't take the dick, it made me lazy
We split apart and now I met this new trick Dainy
Now me and Dainy, we been together ever since
Our love combines to form a science, what is this?
I bust her cherry, took her virginity in '91 (Word)
Now that she's open, everybody want to tap something
Go get your own, don't make me have to fucking clap something
I love my shorty more than life, now ain't that something?
To love you, Dainy, more than living itself
Even though my friends tell me she ain't good for my health
When I go pick her up, they tell me put her back on the shelf
They say, yo P, she only wants you for one thing, that's your wealth
But I don't pay attention, 'cause she's my baby, the Dainy
You know she drive me crazy, she's my number one lady
Met her back in '89, now she's 22, acting like she 40 (Word)
She said "All I need is a man to support me"
Besides, you from the 41st side of things (Uhh)
And Queensbridge niggas be acting like they kings
Pushin' Lexuses, wearing fat diamond rings
My cellular phone reigns supreme, international, think rational
The 12th Street crew, move back when we come through
I think the whole world's going insane
I fill my brain up with Dainy, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's going insane
I fill my mind up with liquor, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's losing its brain
I fill my brain up with liquor, and drink away the pain (What, what)
I think the whole world's going insane
I fill my mind up with Dainy, and drink away the pain

Tommy Hil' was my nigga, and others couldn't figure
How me and Hilfiger used to move through with vigor
Had to sit and plan on how to make these seven figures
Said a Brinks is coming through, at Fashion Avenue
At Tuesday at two, now we gotta form a crew
Of motherfuckers, who ain't going out like suckers
Told me call Karl Kani, and all my other brothers
I told my sister Walker, who was the smoothest talker
Negotiate the deal with them other money stalkers
Diesel drove the the Bimmer, the hatchback of course
Nautica'll navigate to keep us on course
Polo's acting bolo, trying to say he the Boss
I said shut the fuck up, the kid is out with the loot sack
Got a big trey pound, itchin' just to swoop back
Timb is on the roof with the twelve gauge rifle
Scope is on the top so you know he livin' Eiffel
Took the aim of Oswald, caught him North in the Face
All them other kids, they had they tools aimed at space
Levi had the snub, so you know they getting laced
Donna Karan was cryin' 'cause mad shells was flyin'
Damn, all we want is a piece of the pie and
Nike scooped the sacks 'cause he moves like Air
Threw them shits up in the trunk, now we up out here
Got back to the mansion to divvy up the paper
Helly Hansen was the brain of the whole entire caper
So she felt it was right, for her to get the whole slice
Everybody in the crew didn't think it was nice
I guess not, and Guess was hot, so guess what (What?)
Guess took the jigga, and jigged her in the gut
When you play with crime, sometimes it's not too fly
Even though the goods look deceiving to the eye
The end situation could leave your ass fried (Yo, aiyo)
That's why you got to walk on by, walk on by
Walk on by, walk on by, walk on by

My man P put me on to the shorty Henn Rock
Now Henn Rock is strong enough to make your heartbeat stop
One sip, I thought the bitch was a fucking warlock
The more she started givin' me, the stronger I got
Pushed her off to the crew, then she started gettin' jealous
Steamed 'cause I spent more cream with the fellas
"Fuck them niggas, spend that cheese on me
See if they be around when you need pussy"
Then I thought to myself, yo this trick is right
Gathered up all my dough, so I spent the night
I can't help it, she got my brain in a headlock
Niggas started riffin' "Why you trickin'?, yo, this shit must stop
Moms like you need to see the AA
Better hope they help your ass out on the same day
But never that, I got the shakes so I need that
Son call me stressed out, I just be that
But when it comes to Henn Rock, dunn, I need that
She's my shorty for life, so fuck the feedback
I think the whole world's goin' insane
I fill my brain with the Henny, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's lost its brain
I sip away on the liquor, and drink away the pain

To all the brothers who ain't here
Pour a little somethin' on the floors man
Time to get a little bent, do our thing
Word up, the 41st side of Queens
Getting bent, you know what I mean
It's an everyday thing
Henny got my mind in a headlock, Dainy got me goin' crazy
Dainy take me away, Dainy take me away25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Word up, son, I heard they got you on the run
For a body - now it's time to stash the guns
They probably got the phones tapped so I won't speak long
Gimme a hot second, and I'mma put you on
It's all messed up, somebody snitching on the crew
And word is on the street is they got pictures of you
Homicide came to the crib last night, six deep
Asking on your whereabouts and where d'you sleep
They said they just wanna question you, but me and you know
That once they catch you, all they do is just arrest you
Then arraign you, hang you, I don't think so
It's a good thing you bounced for now, just stay low
Once in a blue, I check to see how you're doing
I know you need loot, so I send it through Western Union
They probably knock down the door
In the middle of the night, sometimes around four
Hoping to find who they looking for, but they won't succeed
All they gonna find is mad empty bags of weed
But word, son, you got the projects hotter than hell
Harder for brothers to get their thug on, but oh well
Son, they know too much, even the hoodrat chicks
"Oh, you heard who did what?" No, I don't know who did shit
So stop asking, and I know I'm not going crazy
From windows, I see lights flashing and maybe
Somebody's taking pictures - you know who that be
Police lovers, and neighborhood snitches
They put up a G, so everybody's pointing fingers
And lying, aiyyo son, the temp is rising
The temperature's rising, no there's nothing surprising
The temperature's rising, huh, and ain't nothing surprising
The temperature's rising, huh, and ain't nothing surprising
The temperature's rising (There's nothing surprising)

What up, black? Hold your head wherever you at
On the flow from the cops with wings on your back
That snitch nigga - gave police your location
We'll chop his body up in six degrees of separation
Killer, listen, shit ain't the same without you at home
Phony niggas walk around trying to be your clone
They really fear you, when you was at home, they was pale
That's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail
By the time you hear this rhyme, you'll probably be locked up
Tried to hide, somewhere along the lines, your plans slipped up
Got caught up in a crime that you can't take back
Reminiscing how I used to pick you up in the Ac'
Years ago when we was younger
Seemed the hood took us under very deep
Wondering who snitch, it got me losing lots of sleep at night
You know my mouth is tight
I never sang to the cops 'cause that shit ain't right
Sometimes, I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack
Damn - why the situation go down like that?
It'll be a long time before the heat dies down
And a - couple of years 'fore we see you around
But 'til then, maintain and keep your story the same
The cops is grabbing wrong niggas, looking for someone to blame
They harassing, struggling to find the truth
There's a chance ya case'll get thrown out
'Cause they ain't got no proof
To say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy
Deliver me the gun, I'll tie it to a brick and throw it in the river
Make sure it sinks to the bottom
Outsmart police, snuck you out the projects, we got 'em!
But still, but still, but still...
The temperature's rising, no there's nothing surprising
The temperature's rising, huh, and ain't nothing surprising
The temperature's rising, huh, and ain't nothing surprising
The temperature's rising (There's nothing surprising)
The temperature's rising, and ain't nothing surprising
The temperature's rising, and ain't nothing surprising
The temperature's rising, and ain't nothing surprising
The temperature's rising, and ain't nothing surprising
(Surprising)

Now, '94 to '95, innocent without crime
Drop that shit

Yeah, yeah, check it out
Now run for your life, or you wanna get your heat, whatever
We can die together
As long as I send your maggot ass to the essence
I don't give a fuck about my presence
I'm lost in the blocks of hate and can't wait
For the next crab nigga to step and meet fate
I'm lethal when I see you, there is no sequel
24/7, Mac-11 is my people
So why you wanna end your little life like this?
'Cause now you've bumped heads with kids that's lifeless
I live by the day only if I survive the last night
Damn right, I ain't tryna fight
We can settle this like some grown men on the concrete floor
My slugs will put a stop to your hardcore
Ways of action, I grab the gat, then
Ain't no turnin' back when I start blastin'
Pick up the handle and insert the potion
Cock the shit back in a calm-like motion
No signs of anger or fear 'cause you the one in danger
Never share your plans with a stranger, word is bond
Check it out, now
I put the drop on you, kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on, nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me? I'm buckin' right back at you
I put the drop on you, kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on, nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me? I'm buckin' right back at you
Fuck where you at, kid, it's where you're from
'Cause where I'm from, niggas pack nothin' but the big guns
Around my way, niggas don't got remorse for out-of-towners
Come through frontin' and get stuffed with the 3-pounder
The loud sounder, ear ringer
And I'mma point the finger at all you wannabe gunslingers
You got a real ice grill, but are you really real?
Step to the hill and I'mma test your gun skills
'Cause real niggas don't try to profile
You just a chump who needs to get drunk to buckwild
But swing that bullshit this way
And I'mma make your visit to the 'Bridge a motherfuckin' short stay
Queensbridge, that's where I'm from
The place where stars are born and phony rappers get done
Six blocks and you might not make it through
What you gonna do when my whole crew is blazin' at you?
With MACs and TECs to lend to get your dome crushed
You thought that you could come around my way and beef, stupid fuck?
What the hell you smokin'? What the fuck possessed you?
To come out your face, now I have to wet you
Throw on my Timbs, black mask and black serpent
Twist a nigga cap, then jump in the J-30 'cause I'm--
Puttin' the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me? I'm buckin' right back at you
Puttin' the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me? I'm buckin' right back at you
Who's the richest nigga in the project? Who got it locked?
Rockin' convertibles, drop-tops and mad hot
Peace to that whiz kid and playas on his team
Who's organized, all eyeballs is on CREAM
And your whole clique got nothin' but raw shit
Whip after whip, stay flashin' your dick on tricks
Your whole crew's ravishin', team's untouchable
In the jungle, bangin' Nas, Mobb Deep and Wu
There's money out there, guns catch crumbs, those are your sons
Jums is in the mailboxes, bitches holdin' your guns
You know what's out there, thousands of grams wrapped in Saran
Sealed tight, keep the freshness, that's how we expand
Masked Avenger, drop your gun, son, now surrender
Get ninja'd on the Island, plus the 'Bridge, boy, remember
My little thug's sellin' drugs and he's strugglin'
The game got him buggin', I tried to tell him "Slow down, cousin"
But he vexed, and niggas gettin' wet up in the projects
But with no doubt, shorties out for his respect
But is his brain insane from the lye?
From smokin' that 118 tiny tye
Why? A nigga just died last week
As he swore he was grown and he's a thug in the street
But it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack MAC
His eyes is wild with the rezzy monkey on his back
But I'm stressed and he need to be blessed
With a firepack, don't even go there 'cause it ain't like that
Slow down, baby, he said "What, you tryna play me?
You must be crazy", pulled out the heat and almost blazed me
Then he was Swayze, the shot must've dazed me
Thug sellin' drugs, bustin' slugs, but he ain't crazy25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yo... straight thugs on this side - it's do or die to the death

Read your last rites - God, forgive me
For the sin I'm about to commit - takin' a life
Kill or be killed, rather that than somebody else
Readin' my will - you feel what I feel, you know the deal
Keep the infrared next to my bed, one in the head
Hearin' noises, dead tired, eyes bloodshot red
Sleep with half closed eyelids
Some say it's strange, sometimes that's how strange life get
Go easy on the bottle, niggas love to see when
Niggas slippin' off point, on the strength they bet
Scopin' your ice, appraisin' it like the Diamond District Jeweler
With they hand on the biscuit
Do ya, wanna get caught lifted; or sober, so you can react quick?
Blow you off the atlas as if I caught you fuckin my wife
On my thousand dollar mattress
It's the world that I live in, Q.B. made me
A moms that loved me and a pops that raised me
Y'all need to give it up.. we don't give a fuck..
What y'all niggas want.. thug, life, is, mine
Y'all need to give it up.. cause we don't give a fuck..
What y'all niggas want.. thug, life, is, mine

I got the style of a stillborn child, I'm ill
If it's beef, poke him with the fork, make sure he's done well
(Very very) The streets raised me crazy, now I'm immune to it
So when they start shootin', we don't stop the music
Keep it movin' that's how we do it (c'mon, c'mon Dunn)
Been through more drama than the Baldwins, you still crawlin (still crawlin')
Apply street rules to the office, high performance
Rap author, made millions off of - melodic, hypnotic productions
That'll fuck with your conscience and touch your emotions
(You feel me? You feel me?)
You feel me? I'll write a graphic page
Escort niggas to they grave, relate to the projects
We the black Mobb, it gets deeper than rap music
(Don't get no realer than this!)
It's more real than any words I can muster
Pull the black Cadillac trucks up (what?)
Hop out them shits like what? Y'all niggas can't touch us

Y'all need to give it up.. we don't give a fuck..
What y'all niggas want.. thug, life, is, mine
Y'all need to give it up.. cause we don't give a fuck..
What y'all niggas want.. thug, life, is, mine
Silk shirts on my chest show what a flirt
Halle Berry blew a kiss at the Barbara Streisand concert
Silk pants colored pink, gators match gangster musical thing
And I'll front like my doo doo don't stink
Instinct like Cuba Gooding steppin' out the latest toy
Hazard lights blinkin', gators hit the floor
Everybody watch the red carpet entrance, cameras flashin'
Just to think, that was yesterday's action
'Cause today goes either way - we came a long way
From hallway steps and hand-me-down shit
Fuck my foes, I seen the other side, NexTel cell roam
Call the chopper phone, heliport in my home
Quincy Jones posters
Wake up, guns under my pillow, I can't talk around chauffeurs
Shit is better than a novel, autobiographic
Spit it on tracks, it becomes classic
Start some, make my heart pump, spark one, I'm God son
NAStradamus, last one to blast one when the NARC's come
Know how to leave anything in thirty seconds
When you feel the heat, comin' and flee with the murder weapon
I'll release one, shot you deceased, learn your lesson
Your flesh turn to maggots, bastards, you past it
Cremate your flesh to ashes
You don't need a suit, no wake, no funeral, and no casket
Y'all need to give it up.. we don't give a fuck..
What y'all niggas want.. thug, life, is, mine
Y'all need to give it up.. cause we don't give a fuck..
What y'all niggas want.. thug, life, is, mine

Thug, life, is, mine
Thug, life, is, mine
Thug, life, is, mine
Uhh, thug, life, is, mine
Ill Will..
You need to give it up.. we don't give a fuck
What y'all niggas want.. we don't give a fuck
Thug, life, is, mine
Y'all need to give it up.. we don't give a fuck..
What y'all niggas want.. thug, life, is, mine6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Check it out now
Word up, son, shit is ill, kid
Nahmsayin'?
Bein' that we livin' the motherfuckin' trife life
Still have another day, right?
It's only right
Let me put you on to what happened, son
You ain't gonna believe this shit
Kick that shit

It's just another day, drowning my troubles wit' a forty
That's when I got a call from this brown skin shorty
She asked me where's my crew at, said we could do whatever
She got a crew too and said that we should get together
I said, "Aight, just call me back in a hour
So I can take a shower and gather up the manpower"
Then I hung up the horn
And I thought to myself that it might be on
'Cause this trick ain't pick up the phone to call me in years (Why?)
Ever since I left the ho lonely in tears
Ain't no telling what her friends putting up in her ears
Ideas of setting me up I'm not trying to hear
(Check it out, son) So we take the gats for precautions
Plus, this trick live in Brooklyn, home of the coffin
She might got a whole battalion of Bucktowners
Waiting for us to get up off the train and surround us
Or maybe, I'm blowing this shit out of proportion
But this shit do happen to niggas very often
So fuck it, a nigga gotta do what he meant to
My crew got my back, 'Fuck the world' is my mental
We put together five soldiers
The bitch called, my blood curdled
Told me to meet her on Myrtle
Got to the plaza, we're waiting for the G train
We put a plan together, just in case the beef came
Now we Bed-Stuy bound
Far from home and on unknown ground
But together we six deep, with five heats, nothing sweet
First nigga fronting getting lifted off his fucking feet
It took eternity to reached our destination
My heartbeat is racing like a cardiac patient
We finally got to Myrtle, outside the train station
I saw not a soul, told my peoples to be patient
But hold up, that's when a black caravan rolled up
My legs didn't froze up, I grabbed my pound
Told my man, "Eyes open 'cause it might go down"
Said he don't like the way the shit is starting to sound
Every angle of the car was smoked out and tinted
So we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it
It might have been TNT, I wasn't trying to wait and see
We jetted through Marcy 'cause D's ain't bagging me
Word, son, they got us on the run, dunn, see, yo
Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo
Trife life got me thinking like an animal
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt, yo
What can kill you is what you don't know
OK, check it, you're on your way to your girl's crib
But the bitch live in the 'Bridge
You ain't really sweating it
'Cause little do you know, the niggas in the 'Bridge be setting it
You thought you was safe
And tried to walk the back streets without heat
On the 41st Side of 12th Street
The side where niggas don't give a fuck
The side where if you come through fronting
Kid, you getting bucked
On your way, to apartment 3A
With a phat herringbone, let him slide? No days
Son, get the heat, 'cause I'm about to stick him
(Fuck that shit, yo, if that nigga front, yo, hit him!)
Aight, bet, so just hold it down
While I cock back the long three pound
You're upstairs boning, not knowing that I'm scheming
Just the right time, kid, it's twelve in the evening
You're leaving out the building as you kiss your girl goodbye
Thought you was safe and got caught by surprise
"What's going on?" as I reply
"Shut the fuck up and don't make this to another homicide"
He tried to play tough so I put one in his brain
Even though I took his life, all I wanted was his chain
Come through truck without heat, how you figure?
When you in the projects, keep your fingers on the trigger
But fuck that, we juxing
If you got what we like, it gets tooken
Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo, good looking
Now we catching a cab to Halsey & Lewis in Brooklyn
Getting tore up from the floor up, hit the dress store up
Got the 80 auto in case a nigga wanna roll up
Get your motherfucking shit swoll up
Now it's back to Queens to serve fiends
Making G's by any means, my eyes on my enemies
Sipping Hennessy, with my mind on some crime shit
One-time searching me, but never ever find shit
It's the everyday, get the loot then breeze
Though my goal is to leave outta state, push ki's
But all this bullshit holding me down, I can't leave
Fuck a 9-to-5, I get the loot with ease
Don't even need a degree to earn a six-digit figure
I get mines slinging on the corner with my niggas
Pulling the trigger when the drama appears
'Cause a nigga worse enemy is fear
So, yo....
Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo
Trife life got me thinking like an animal
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt, yo
What can kill you is what you don't know17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It all began on the street, to the back of a blue police vehicle
Next come the bookings, the way things is looking
It's Friday, you in for a long stay
Getting shackled on the bus first thing come Monday
Hoping in your mind you'll be released one day
But knowing, home is a place you're not going for a long while
Now you're up on the Isle
And the position that you in got you refusing to smile
But keep in mind, there's a brighter day, after your time spent
Used to be wild, but locked up, you can't get bent
Thought you could hack it, now you're requesting PC
You're fragile, it ain't hard to see
Niggas like that don't associate with me
I'd rather, get busy to the third degree
'Cause the war in population's on infinitely
If this was the street, my razor would be a MAC demon
Hit you up, leave your whole face screaming
What you in for kid - busting nuts?
Cats heard of me in street stories caught inside this trap
Who are you to look at me with your eyes like that?
Wisen up, young blood, before you make things escalate
And I would hate to set your crooked ass straight

Make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Running from one-time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip
Living the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Running from one-time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip
You tried to dip, duck, but still got bucked
You talk too much shit, you shoulda kept your mouth shut
All that gossip, motherfucker, don't you know my Glock kicks
Hollow tips, to your body, mad toxic
I fade you, blow you with a rusty-ass razor
Did you a favor, tried to wet you but I graze you
Pop goes the Glock when there's beef on the block
Chill for a while, make them think the beef stop
Then I creep like a thief in the night, it's only right
Ain't no turning back, it's on tonight
And if I get caught, then my ass is up north
Straight on a course for upstate New York
Stressed, smoking back to back cigarettes
It popped off, one point in the mess hall
But to avoid that, from head-to-toe dipped in all black
Hit them niggas where they pump they cracks at
Havoc, with the murder master plan
Keep my nine up to par so my shit won't jam
God forbid if my shit do, run behind a tree
Fix my shit then hit you
Slugs in your body, mainly in your brain tissue
Ditch from the scene, get ghost, stash the pistol, so simple
Then, watch my back, lay up and relax
Roll a sack, K-A black, find a shorty to tap
Living the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Running from one-time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip
Living the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Running from one-time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip

I got the power, combine wit' the powder, and water
It oughta, drop in a half and hour
In the, form of oil, watch the cocaine boil
Keep my eye on it so the shit won't spoil
Then I pause... and ask God why
Did he put me on this Earth just so I could die
I sit back and build on all the things I did wrong
Why I'm still breathing, and all my friends gone
I try not to dwell on the subject for a while
'Cause I might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle
But my, heart pumps foul blood through my arteries
And I can't turn it back, it's a part of me
Too late for crying, I'm a grown man struggling
To reach the next level of life without fumbling down or folding
I got no shoulder to lean on but my own
All alone in this danger zone
Time waits for no man, the streets grow worse
Fuck the whole world, kid, my money comes first
'Cause I'm out for the gusto, and trust nobody
If you're not family, then you die by me
'Cause niggas will have you locked up, the snitch be your man
Giving police the run down on your plans
But never going down like that
So I, shut my mouth and hold my words back
Illegal business, forever mines, fuck paying taxes
The last kid that shitted and gave police access
To my blueprints, used names as evidence
Skipped town and I haven't seen the snitch nigga ever since
The moral of the story is easy to figure out
A lesson that you can't live without
Living the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Running from one-time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip
Living the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Running from one-time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Bumped heads here and there, but never got the chance

Forever wild from the cradle to the grave, kid, watch your back
One-time's comin' always (Yeah)
They locked me up for 12 days, I can't comprehend
Now I'm a free man on the streets again
Chasin' St.Ide's down with some Seagrams Gin
Life is like a dice game and I'm in to win

On the scene from the 41st side of Queens (Yeah)
We get the cream, laid up, love-love redeem
'Cause I mean what I mean, I'm out to claim king
Doin' my thing, throughout states my name'll ring

To all my peoples locked down, comin' back to life
In the world once again though ya bid was trife
While you was gone, we was goin' to war
And even more, saw my man layin' dead on the floor
Kid, I swore that our crew will live forever, I guess I was wrong
No, until we meet again, hold ya head and stay strong (Yeah)
Yo, got my mind on a place to hide from police (Where?)
Sweatin' dogs as I'm runnin' cross 12th Street
Just as I approached the block
I spotted Jake on the creep down by Vick's weed spot (Say word)
Made a U-ey up the hill plus a change of plans
I had to, hurry back so I could warn my man
It had me stressin' little somethin', had my heart rapidly pumpin'
Niggas started cuttin', behind the bushes duckin'
My ears rung, I plunged a clip into the guns
Got grazed in the arm, one slug hit my son
He was bleedin' from the head, I couldn't believe it
We was defeated, if it was a case, I couldn't beat it
Felt like cryin' (The temperature's risin')
I saw my man helpless, damn near on the verge of dyin'
So to P I passed the iron

Kid, you ain't lyin'
I went to stash the murder weapon, plus I'm relyin'
On a door to be open, goin' in the building, it's a trap
Police buckin' at me, they try to twist my dome back
Jetted up the staircase to the third floor
Reached behind the sink, throw the heater on the floor
Locked the door, police grabbed me up and tried to break my jaw
Said, "Where's the gun we saw? (I don't know)
We know you was there at the homicide scene
(I don't know nothin')
And if it wasn't you, it was somebody from ya team"

From the cradle to the grave
(From the cradle to the grave)
From the cradle to the grave
(From the cradle to the grave)
From the cradle to the grave
(From the cradle to the grave)
From the cradle to the grave
(Straight from the motherfuckin' cradle to the grave)
Yo, it's the real drama kills, nobody move, stand still
Body you, drop that ass off in a land-field
Son bless me with the iron, I got beef with
Some niggas from the other side over some weak shit
Load up the heaters, greet 'em with the hollow tips
Flip 'em like the Gotti clip, my crew strictly body shit
The cradle to the grave is where I'll end up
Fuck gettin' sent up North, son, I'm bent up
Doin' my dirt on a low
Fuckin' with the Mobb is like a trial, no doubt you gonna blow
You never know, he didn't even have to go
There unprepared, now he's six below
Y'know I'm chillin', I gots no time for catchin' feelings
Get that money I want, some brothers wanna act funny
But it's all good, I still die for the 'hood
For my peoples, yeah, knock on wood

Triple L, rollin' dice while I put you on
To the drama what I gotta say is short not long
This nigga that I'm beginnin' to dislike he got me fed
If he doesn't discontinue his bullshit, he might be dead
You know him well and probably go way back
But I don't care if he's your man doin' shit like that
I hope the word gets back to him, 'cause I'll screw him
He shitted on my man and we got plans to do him
Lets get it over with quick, I'm tired of waitin'
Ain’t no fear over here, dear, we just debatin'
On when and how, later or right now
Spoke to Killa yesterday, he said to chill for a while
But it's hard actin' like everythin' is alright
I get the chills when I see that nigga in my eyesight
A dead man walkin', not only that. he's still talkin'
(About what?) About how and what he did very often
You don't know how much I fiend to put his ass in a coffin
One day, my man and the next, he's not
Didn't know him long anyway, so fuck it
It's funny how things change (Word up!)
From the cradle to the grave
(From the cradle to the grave)
From the cradle to the grave
(From the cradle to the grave)
From the cradle to the grave
(From the cradle to the grave)
From the cradle to the grave
(Straight from the motherfuckin' cradle to the grave)

Fuck it kid, whattup Queens in this motherfucker
(Tell you I'm bangin tonight kid)
(Yo Shorty got a FATTIE right there)
Queensbridge in the house, aiyyo wordup
Aiyyo Ty yo Ty c'mere Son
(Whattup Boo? Can I buy you a drink or something Boo?)
Whattup whattup?
Where Twins and them at yo?
(The fattie's bangin!)
I don't know (damn!)
I think Twins laid up
Aiyyo Son gimme two Hennessee
Son I want two Henessee's yo!
Straight yo, word up man!
*chaos*
Aiyyo what up with them Queens niggas man!
Hey, fuck you!
What? What the fuck, what?
Think they killers or somethin', man
Ay, fuck you money, whattup kid?
*more chaos*

I open my eyes to the streets where I was raised as a man
And learned to use my hands for protection in scuffles
Throwin' my blows in doubles
I'm comin' from Queens, motherfucker, carryin' guns in couples
And wildin', a Q-U soldier
From Lefrak to Rockaway, back to Queensbridge, black
It's only crack sales makin' niggas act like that
Back in the days we would scrap, now you lay on your back
As things changed with time, I traded in my knuckles for a Mac-10
And rather live the life of crime
With my Bed-Stuy connection connectin' in two
It's liable to start shit too wild for you
Peace to, Baisley, Forty-P get down
And when you outta town, represent your ground
Them niggas bleed just like us, so show 'em where we come from
Queens; leavin' niggas done, son
The Mobb gets hectic
Shit is for real up in Queens we get hectic
Shit is for real we abouts to get hectic
Shit is for real we abouts to get hectic
Shit is for real we abouts to get hectic

As we sling on the corners like we always do
Son, get that loot quick, spendin' dough like I never had shit
I'm livin' large, pushin' luxury cars
Though that shit is outta reach, anybody in my way gets scarred
Permanently bed-ridden
And if you're pussy, then motherfucker, get in where you fit in
As I walk around the streets
Son, I got mad beef, I'mma blast you before you blast me
That's my philosophy 'cause nowadays you gotta be relentless
Grab my MAC and slap a nigga senseless
Don't try to play me, if you do, you better D.O.A. me
Son, I got 'em shook, grab a little baby for shields
You got drama, run for shelter for real
Pour some beer for the ill, ain't no time to chill
Hit 'em up, 'cause I'm quick to erupt like this
Wet 'em up with the MAC, scratch 'em off my list
Show 'em the real meanin' of drama, you never had it
'Til you bumped heads with the Havoc
Ain't nuttin' soft or sweet, I lift you off your feet
When I cock back the heat, whole crews retreat
Ain't nothing soft or sweet, I lift you off your feet
When I cock back the heat, whole crews retreat
We gets hectic
Shit is for real, we abouts to get hectic
Shit is for real, we abouts to get hectic

Everything is real inside my mind
These days, you can't make it if you ain't affiliated with crime
A lifetime of street livin'
Throughout the beef I've accumulated
Many slugs have been given
But wildin' ain't the way to be livin'
You're only gonna end up bloody on the floor shiverin'
Or locked up, caught inside the beast
Meanwhile, on the streets, ain't no more peace
My man, Sto-Bo, kid, hold your own
In a cell locked down, not far from home
And at the same time on the outside, I'm representin'
Still packin' heat, make you cowards keep steppin'
Gettin' high, it's 'cause of the lye, I can't lie
I could move the crowd poppin' slugs in the sky
Why come around if you afraid of what's over here?
My man Havoc put the bug in my ear
On the real, for real, but wait, it gets realer
Real like an innocent child that turned killer
It's things like that that only makes things iller
Makin' cream, doin' sticks if you ain't a drug dealer
(It's) only facts coming out of my mouth piece
As far as I can see, these streets is gettin' sour
Q-U, too much drama to get into
And niggas regret when they begin to
Regardless of your name or what you been through
Pause for a second, open your eyes and think, duke
Life ain't the game that it seems to be
Fuck a fantasy, I'm livin' in reality
Caught up in this untouchable mentality
Hit you up bad, make you loose a few calories
I need to slow down, movin' through life at a high speed
Watchin' all the slow runners pass by me
I can see through you, due to, my Queens education
Speakin' on behalf of this drug-game nation
The Foundation
Queens nation
Up in Queens, shit is for real, we abouts to get hectic
Word up
Shaolin, shit is for real, we abouts to get hectic
Word up, kid
The B.K., the shit is for real, we abouts to get hectic
KnowhatI'msayin? (No doubt!)
And Manhattan, shit is for real, we abouts to get hectic
Up in the Bronx, we abouts to get hectic
Word up, knowhatI'msayin? The whole world, kid
Shit is over with, Mobb Deep say party UHH

Word life, combination to the safe, it's on
Get that loot, motherfucker, spread love when you on
The 41st got the heat for them niggas that thirst
Yes, divine nine shine, put that ass in line
Regulate, I'm only here just to take what's mine
My clique combine, dangerous minds done bust the outline
A half a man generatin' grands
Kid, you know how I go, only fuck with fam
That's why you're lookin' from the outside in
Wonderin' how we bubblin', hustlin', breakin' days in
Grimy motherfuckers, gettin' info from your baby's mother
Got her pillow talking while that ass is sleepwalking
So all that bullshit you did, I know where you live
You better be on point when you walk in the rest
Your broke ass probably don't got a vest
So I suggest change your location is best
'Cause I'm coming through army fatigue dressed
Blessed with hollow tips, yes
To burn through your dirty-ass Guess
(Yes, still shinin', still climbin')
Ayo, your timing was way the fuck off, what is you tryin'?
This faggot-ass cat should get clapped for even tryin'
He tried to confront me, but only faced iron
Put holes through your shirt like Jamaican clothes
Fuck the myths, but science and numbers is how I live
If we ain't gettin' mathematics, somethin' got to give
Broke all your fucking life with no will to live
There's no way to live, resort to Plan B
Start to sticking, strongarm robbery and icepicking
It's sneak vicking, it's cold outside
I think it's past time for me to grab the clapper and take mines
You follow what I'm saying? It's like leading the blind
Trying to voice a clear picture of this life of crime
You slow learners'll understand in due time
Up the ladder of success with TECs, we trying to eat
And put that fly shit on my back
And bless my feet with some new and improved, spectate or make a move
Hesitate or regulate, it's on you

Up the ladder of success with TECs, we build and destroy
Still climbing, still shining
Up the ladder of success with TECs, we build and destroy
Still shining, still climbing
Up the ladder of success with TECs, we build and destroy
Still shining, still climbing
Up the ladder of success with TECs, we build and destroy
What?
Nine-six, motherfucker
