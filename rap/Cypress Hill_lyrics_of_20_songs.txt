Who you trying to get crazy with ése?
Don't you know I'm loco?


To the one on the flamboyant tip
I'll just toss that ham in the frying pan
Like spam, get done when I come and slam
Damn, I feel like the Son of Sam
Don't make me wreck shit, hectic
Next get the chair got me going like General Electric
"Aaaant", the lights are blinking, I'm thinking
It's all over when I go out drinking
Ohh, making my mind slow
That's why I don't fuck with the big 4-O
Bro, I got to maintain
'Cause a nigga like me is going insane

Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane, got no brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Do my shit undercover, now it's time for the blubber
Blabber, to watch that belly get fatter
Fat boy on a diet, don't try it
I'll jack yo' ass like a looter in a riot
My shit's fat, like a sumo, slamming dat ass
Leavin your face in the grass
'Cause you know, I don't take a duro, lightly
Punks just jealous 'cause they can't outwrite me
Or kick that style, wicked, wild
Happy face nigga never seen me smile
Rip that mainframe, I'll explain
A nigga like me is going insane

Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane, got no brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!

Like Louie Armstrong, played the trumpet
I'll hit that bong and break you off something
Soon I got to get my props
Cops, come and try to snatch my crops
These pigs wanna blow my house down
Head underground to the next town
They get mad when they come to raid my pad
And I'm out in the nine-deuce Cad'
Yes I'm the pirate, pilot
Of this ship if I get with the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen?
Look, but don't make you eyes strain
A nigga like me is going insane

Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane, got no brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!

*Mexican yells*
— Word up, Tequila style
— Cometelo!

Eat the worm motherfucker
Tequila spice, hot nice
Feeling right, sipping on Jose Cuervo
Down in Tiajuana, Mexico
Thinking of the big score the night before
Met the connect, who was impressively dressed
In high fabrics
With troops like Beirut, up on the mezzanine
Brandishing sub-machine guns, aye-yo
It's all about the money, son
Now that's the only reason
We came south of the border, to complete this work order
We gotta get it, no looking back, going all out for it
Ready to attack, die in a minute flat for it
As God is my witness, we got ditches
For all you motherfuckin fake bitches
It all boils down to the business
Nothing personal, when niggas acting like they helping you
I fuckin blast you like Frank Castle, motherfucker!
Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!
Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!

I never knew money like this, in the palm of my hand
'Til I met the man with mad hook-up, and big plan
Every where you look'a, he got everybody shook up
Running for cover, the big bad wolf (WOOF), motherfucker
He was like a father figure, show me the bigger picture
Fuck slangin' on the corner, don't let the pigs get you
Not like these fools who don't comprehend
You end up doing a twenty-five bit in the pen
You got that? Getting your cup, I took a swig
The bitter taste of the 'mezcal', free worm shit
Droppin' a lesson, he slapped my face, he said listen
Pay attention brotha, you're my ace, but don't ever question
Just do what I say, and you'll be rich
And keep this in your mind: rats lay in a ditch with no spine
Don't ever forget that golden rule in the game
Cheers, they all know your name, it's like fame
Why, women and money don't mix, like drinking an' driving
Watch those conniving women and keep your eye out
Always be aware of what's around you
They wanna down you, and fuckin' clown you
Keep your shit in order the money won't stop
Pretty soon you'll be on top
Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!
Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!

Tequila Sunrise, with the bloodshot eyes
My, my, my, how time flies and goes by, surprise!
My mentor passed on and passed a warn to me, emergency
For my enemies who wanna murder me
Eat the worm, mothafucka, while you burn, mothafucka
Better kill me, don't let me return, mothafucka
Trust no man, cause I'll be back, you understand?
With a plan, and my ice in hand, I want it all
I recall the words from Jesus, you are the Juice
Better go get it, don't let it get to your head, embed it
Let these words stick, you better be ready to die
Now take a fucking sip, caution it, but I never lie

Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!
Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!
Tequila, eat the worm Ese, eat that shit!
Don't be scared Ese
Yo, so where is he man? You know?
He said he‘d be here, homies
Damn, he’s a little late but,  he’ll be here, just wait
Is it some good shit, man?
Man, the dude said the shit was powerful as shit
I hope he’s got some good shit, man
Because he is late it‘s 5'o clock already
He is gonna be here, homies, he’s gonna be here, homies10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's another one of them ol' funky Cypress Hill things
You know what I'm sayin?
And it goes like this

Hey don't miss out on what you're passin'
You're missin', the hoota of the funky Buddha
Eluder of your fucked up styles, I get wicked
So come on as Cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaw stridin', when suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush when they see me drivin'
By, hangin' out the window
With my Magnum takin' out some putos
Actin' kinda loco, I'm just another local
Kid from the street gettin' paid from my vocals
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
I'm ignorin' all the dumb shit
Yo, because nothing is comin' from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fuckin' around
My gat straight hummin'
Hummin'... comin' at cha...
And you know I had to gat ya

Time for some action, just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shinin' a battle light
Sen got the gat, and I know that'll gat ya right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man!
One-time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said "Yo, it's on
Take cover son, or you're assed-out
How you like my chrome?" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast out, but I did anyway...
Hahaha... that young punk had to pay
(So I just killed a man!)

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite ya with insights
And if you ain't down: bullshit!
Say some punk try to get you for your auto
Would you call the one-time, play the role model?
No, I think you play like a thug
Next ya hear the shot of a Magnum slug
Hummin', comin' at cha
Yeah ya know I'm gonna gat ya
So how do ya know where I'm at, when you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm comin' from?
When you're up on the hill in your bigger home
I'm out here riskin' my dome
Just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive, ay yo I gotta say "fuck it"

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong

Pick it, pack it, fire it up, come along
And take a hit from the bong
Put the blunt down just for a second
Don’t get me wrong it’s not a new method
Inhale, exhale
Just got a ounce in the mail
I like a blunt or a big fat cone
But my double barrel bong is gettin’ me stoned
Home skillet, there’s water inside don’t spill it
It smells like shit on the carpet, still it
Goes down smooth when I get a clean hit
Of the skunky funky smelly green shit
Sing my song, puff all night long
As I take hits from the bong

Hits from the bong y’all
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Let’s smoke that bowl, hit the bong
And then take that finger off of that hole
Plug it, unplug it, don’t strain
I love you Mary Jane
She never complains, when I hit Mary
With that flame, I light up the cherry
She’s so good to me
When I pack a fresh bowl I clean the screen
Don’t get me stirred up the smoke, through the bub-bling
Water is makin’ it pure so I got ta’
Take my hit and hold it, just like
Chong, I get the bowl and I reload it
Get my four-footer and bring it on
As I take hits from the bong

Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?

Can I get a hit?

Some people tell me that I need help
Some people can fuck off and go to hell
God damn, why they criticize me
Now shit is on the rise so my family despise me
Fuck 'em! And feed 'em, cause I don't need 'em
I won't join 'em if I can beat 'em
They don't understand my logic
To my gat to my money and I'm hooked on chronic
I never wanted to hurt a nigga
Unless ya come flexin' that trigga, I dig ya
That grave on the east side of towwwwn
Lay ya six feet undergrounnnnd
From man, to the dust to the ashes
All I remember tell me where the cash is
Click-clack, barrel at my dome
Give all your loot or you ain't goin' home
But I ain't goin' out with a bang
Wa da da dang, wa dada daa dang

I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's drivin' me mad inside
I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's fuckin' me up in my mind
I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's drivin' me mad inside
I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's fuckin' me up in my mind
Motherfuckers be drivin' me up the walls
Hopin' that I fall but they can lick my balls
Straight jacket, strap it
In a padded room when some punk niggas can't hack it
Distracted from all reality
Now I'm let out on a minor technicality
(Ahhh) They all fucked up now
Cause they let a nigga back on the streets somehow
I'm lookin' for someone like me
Livin' in my own world to my own degree
On the loose in the city lookin' at the ho wit' the big titties
Lookin' at me and I feel shitty
A little tensed up gettin' hot
Cause she looks like my girl who got smoked at the crack spot
I'm tryin' to find ways to cope
But I ain't fuckin' round with the gauge or a rope

I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's drivin' me mad inside
I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's fuckin' me up in my mind
I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's drivin' me mad inside
I'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's fuckin' me up in my mind

I'm havin' illusions
I'm havin' illusions

Alot of a...sharks out there...try'na take a bite of somethin'
What's hot
Lot of chameleons out there...try'na change up
Anytime somethin' new comes along...everybody wants a bite
Don't happen overnight

So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

I remember the days when I was a young kid growin' up
Looking in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
The rock crowd, make money, chill with the honey's
Sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
Shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest
And the games that be comin' with it, nevertheless
You got to go for the gusto but you don't know
About the blood, sweat and tears and losing some of your peers
And losing some of yourself to the years past gone by
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act
Shit's deep, 48 tracks
Studio gangster mack signed the deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil'
But never will till he crosses over
Still filling your head with fantasies
Come with me, show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese
You wanna be a rock superstar in the biz?
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high
And some can't pay the way
Still trapped in what you rappin' about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The route you took started collapsing
No fans, no fame, no respect, no change, no women
And everybody shits on your name

So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
Be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
People see rockstars, younawhaI'msayin?
But you still...try'na...get out more like, like everybody else
You know? It's a fun job, but it's still a job, you know?
Save your money man, save your money too
Hit single don't last very long, younawhaI'msayin?
I mean...you're lucky in this game too
There's gon' be another cat comin' out
Lookin' like me, soundin' like me, next year I know this
They'll be a flipside, do whatchu you do
Somebody'll try to spin off like some serious

You ever have big dreams of makin' big cream?
Big shot, heavy hitter on the mainstream
You wanna look trendy in the Bentley
Be a snob and never act friendly
You wanna have big fame, let me explain
What happens to these stars and their big brains
First they get played like all damn day
Long as you sell everything will be okay
Then you get dissed by the media and fans
Things never stay the same way they began
I heard that some never give full to the fullest
That's while fools end up dining on the bullet
Think everything's fine in the big time
See me in my Lex' with the chrome raised high
So you wanna roll far and live large?
It ain't all that goes with bein' a rock star

So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

My own son don't know me
I'm chillin' in the hotel room lonely
But I thank God I'm with my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or video didn't show me
No love, the phony, gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like Monie
And the press say that my own people disown me
And the best way back is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
They're too worried about them honies at the Palladium
Who just wanna cling on, swing on, and so on
Go on, fall off, the hoes roll on
Till the next rock superstar with no shame
Give him a year, he'll be right out the game
The same as the last one who came before him
Gained fame, started gettin' ignored, I warned him
Assured him, this ain't easy take it from Weezy
Sleezy people wanna be so cheesy, the fuckin' lethal
"Assassins, assassins"

So you wanna be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rock superstar?
And live large, a big house, five cars, you're in charge

I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high

Well it's the funk elastic, the blunt I twist it
The slamafied, Buddha-fied funk on your discus
Oh, what you missed this, you got to bear witness
Catch a ho and another ho, Merry Christmas
Yes I smoke shit, straight off the roach clip
I wrote shit for the blunted ones to approach it
Forward motion, make you sway like the ocean
The herb is more than just a powerful potion
What's the commotion, yo I'm not joking around
People learning about, what they're smoking
My oven's on high, when I roast the quail
Tell Bill Clinton to go and inhale
Exhale, now you felt the funk of the Thai
Wanna feel the effects...

I want to get high–so high!
I want to get high–so high!
I want to get high–so high!
I want to get high–so high!

Livin on fat pockets on full with the gat
Rolling around nine deuce Cadillac
Still got my homies to watch my back
And they'll smoke your ass if you wanna come and chat
That's why some pigs and the kids come sweating they follow
A hollow point shell's hard to swallow (hey)
Why wallow when you come to roll on?
I put the clip in the .45, bring your ass on
Left kicking dust as you hear the gat bust
My cribs surrounded, I'm about to get rushed, I brushed with death
How many shells stuffed in my closet where my big chrome things kept

When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (you better be ready)

I told the boys get the sawed off Glock and the rest of the gats
As I strapped on the bullet-proof vest
BOOM, I think I caught one to the chest
Hot damn I didn't want to kill a man, shit
I still stand tall with the hill clan y'all better stand back
Niggas bout ta fall, I'm coming out blasting like Yosemite Sam
Got the cheese and the bread for the ham
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)

"Hello Dr. Greenthumb, paging Dr. Greenthumb!"

Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
In the hills where the trees grow wild with weed fields
The fuckin' pigs with shields holding the blue steels
Greenhouse effect with the weed connect
(Doctor) DEA can't keep Greenthumb in check (Doctor!)
HPS, God Bless the whole crop
Please God, don't let me see no cops
Trunkload, ready to hit the highway
Don't let the eye in the sky fly my way
Or we gonna have big trouble, that's no shit
Can't be growin without no permit
But fuck that, I study the 215 trip
That way when they come they can suck my dick
Weed can't grow without attention
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Hello, my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Ayo, Dr. Greenthumb, come on back one time
People can't live without the herb man
If not they'd be drinkin and drivin and swervin
But thanks to Dr. Greenthumb weed grow
In the backyard or inside with hydro
To the kush plant brush in a tangerine dream
Tasty, blowin a fuckin smokescreen
Cycles of weed are constantly grown
Somebody give me the razor to cut clones
I'd like to stop, but it feels so good
Horny plants stinkin up my whole neighborhood
DEA, never wanna leave me alone
But never ever ever gotta warrant for my home
What that funny sound knockin at the door (Open up it's the DEA!)
Sorry Greenthumb can't talk no more
Please don't follow me into the sun
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Hello, my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello, my name is Dr. Greenthumb
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
Hello, my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Out from the lab, no need for rehab
If I can't drive then call me a cab (ese!)
In my closet the weed is dried out
Like Eiht said, ain't no place to hide out
I don't wanna buy no weed from no cop
Get locked up and they close up my shop
That's why I buy no weed from no one
That's why they call me Dr. Greenthumb
The scientifical, mystical one
Growin my crops with the rays of the sun
Come one come all and see how it's done
If you see the pigs there's no need to run
Cause some of these pigs are down with Greenthumb
But you never know what be the outcome
You see the photo in the album
The weed is growin like my erection
Look I never told you where I was from
Some call me Real, but I'm Dr. Greenthumb
Hello, my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello, my name is Dr. Greenthumb
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
Hello, my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello, my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Always roll deep on the streets like the mafia

Makin' that feria, spittin' that raps
Ya me conoces, I'm down for my calle

Ya tu sabes, we don't play that shit
Any pendejo's gettin' hit up quick

Well I'm an alley cat, some say a dirty rat
On my side is my gat, see I'm all of that
Spittin' out buck shots, boy I'm gonna wet'cha
Run and hide, but I'm still comin' to get'cha
Thinkin' like a peace smoke, comin' on a homicide
You talkin' shit, tryna take me for a ride
I'm not a bad guy, but I'm the funky feel
Finger on the trigger when my hands up on a steel
Lettin' out a bullet, this is goin' boo-ya
You're stuck in my hood, so what ya gonna do now?
Bein' the hunted one is no fun
Here I come son, yo I think ya better run
Better run more, and move a little faster
Second of thought and I'm comin' to blast ya
With my...

Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Left hand on a forty, (Puffin' on a blunt)
Pumped my shotgun, (Them niggas didn't jump)
Lala la la lala la laaaaa...

Comin' at you like a stiff blow, fuckin' up your program
Ain't takin' shit from you him or no man
Master mind maniac and a menace, soooo
How they want to pass the sentence
All because a nigga tried to play me on the trigger
He missed, so now the nigga's hist
Rude and crude like a pit bull, get to the point
Your fuckin' card will get pulled, now
I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And I'm handin' out beatdowns
I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And I'm handin' out beatdowns (Get your face down!)
Put me in chains, try to beat my brains
I can get out, but the grudge remains
When I see ya punk ass, I'm gonna getcha
Get some through ya, shotgun go boo-yaa!
Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Left hand on a forty, (Puffin' on a blunt)
Pumped my shotgun, (Them niggas didn't jump)
Lala la la lala la laaaaa...

Kickin' that funky Cypress Hill shit
Think I'll light another for the blunted to chill with
'Cause I'm the chill one, known to get ill when
They stepped to the Hill "What's up?", I had to kill one
Now I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And they got me on lock down
Headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And they got me on lock down
Livin' like a nigga who done lost his mind
'Cause I ain't goin' out like a spineless jellyfish
Some say life is a bitch
Ask that punk who dug his own ditch
Up on the Hill fuckin' up at a party
Tried to get funny, put a hole in his body
Lala la la lala la laaa
Look at all of those funeral cars
'Cause I'ma

Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Left hand on a forty, (Puffin' on a blunt)
Pumped my shotgun, (Them niggas didn't jump)
Lala la la lala la laaaaa...5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Boom biddy bye bye
Boom biddy bye bye

Step back as I'm kicking up dust
For a while
As I put mothafuckas to rest
And pull their files
Out from the cabinet
With the picture
Get the 45 and settle it
With this punk nigga
Slow your roll
As I take control
Take your toke from the Indo'
Then hit and hold
Now let it out
How you feel when the herb
Got you by the balls
And you're coughing up a lung anyhow
You can't shake
That nigga that's gonna brake
Fool
On any one member of your bitch crew
As I pull the trigger
On my nine
Say goodnight nigga
Boom biddy bye bye
Boom biddy bye bye
Put your ass on the floor an' don't ask why
Boom biddy bye bye
I put my Glock to your dome and you started to cry
Boom biddy bye bye
Any last prayers before you die
Boom biddy bye bye
Rock-a-bye nigga boom biddy bye bye

You ain't never caught a rabbit
So you ain't no friend of mine
It's a habit
Barkin' up your tree with my nine
Keep your bitch on a leash or at home
A nick knack
Paddywack
Give the dog a bone
The raw dog
Fuck a law dog
Still handin' out beat-downs wit' my sawed-off
Cause a every now and then I got to knuckle up
Buckle up
Chin checking
It's on I reckon
It's the wild wild west
Get your 40 and your blunt and your Glock and your bulletproof vest
Let me guess
Everybody wanna test
Everybody burning up, gonna get burned like Ses
Lodi Dodi
We're fucking everybody
Boom biddy bye
Sing the lullaby
In the party
Boom biddy bye bye
Put your ass on the floor an' don't ask why
Boom biddy bye bye
I put my Glock to your dome and you started to cry
Boom biddy bye bye
Any last prayers before you die
Boom biddy bye bye
Rock-a-bye nigga boom biddy bye bye

Yes yes ya'll
To the beat ya'll
Watch a punk slipin' see the puto fall
I'm buck-loody
Looking for the nigga who wanna cut me
Cause the nigga gets so funky
Fool I'm the one
From The big bad Cypress Hill clique, a
Number one son of the funk freaka
Yes yes ya'll
I'll be the one with the mad Buddha blast ya'll
Comin' from the west ya'll
But I figure
You'd cry like a bitch
Don't twitch
Cause I just might pull the trigga
Now lay down
Stay down
Don't move a muscle if you see your homeboy's brains on the ground
Don't fuck don't say nothin'
You fuck around and I might get ragamuffin
Boom biddy bye bye
Lined up on the floor now you' all gonna die
Boom biddy bye bye
Put your ass on the floor an' don't ask why
Boom biddy bye bye
I put my Glock to your dome and you started to cry
Boom biddy bye bye
Any last prayers before you die

Gimmie that beat, bitch! (vocal sample: "We Are At War")
Ding Ding Muthafucka
It's round two
I got my lunch and my dinner, fool
You think we gonna bow down to some punk ass niggas
We from the evil side, boy
Chorus: B-Real 
Doughboy , Wack 10 
Doughboy , Wack 10 
Doughboy , Wack 10 
Doughboy , Wack 10 

In about four seconds some east side niggas
Is gonna put the foot in the ass of Doughboy and Wack 10
I suggest you stay tuned muthafuckas

It takes two of you faggots to get with one of me
Now I'm running up in you hoes with "No Vaseline"
You could be the big fish, bring your drama
Fuck your mama, I'll bring the pack of piranhas
You tried to pull a ditty, ho
But you the one who got the alternative rockers up in your video
You get addicted
You can take your four W fingers
And stick it in Mack 10's ass and lick it
Ice Cube is a thing of the past
If I got no nuts it's because they're still stuck in your ass
You're the King of punks, king of busters, king of thieves
Now get down of your fuckin' knees (Shag: Bow Down)
Start to sucking
You tried to remake N.W.A. without Dre and Ren
Dub's cool, but you're fuckin' up with Mack 10
Silly little philly, I'm back tearing'
Can you really see my machine gun turrets?
Open and aimed at your fat little frame
How can I miss?
I'll twist your cap and take your name
Analyze it, my name should be Mack 11
I'm a higher caliber MC, there's no question
Anytime you wann run up you get dealt with
You get melted "Check Yo' Self" (bitch check it)
Ice Cube, you better tell'em (tell 'em mutha-fucka)
Muggs made the best songs on your third album (biatch!)

You and Wack 10
Can't deal with this
Cypress Hill to the muthafuckin' fullest
Fuck y'all
So what'cha wanna do?
Bring it on, nigga
This is Shag from the Neighborhood Family

Mack 10 is a bitch, suckin' Ice Cube's dick
But what you faggots know about some gangsta shit? (B-Real: Nothin)
Let's take it to the streets and fight like real g's
What you niggas wanna do? You can't fuck with these
Ain't never had a strap now you wanna gangsta rap
Can't come to your hood cause you're scared to get jacked
Fuck peace, this is war everybody on the floor
When I see your fat ass I'm takin' one to your jaw
Fuck you Fuck your mama fuck your whole clique
Better yet, fuck every nigga that you're down wit'
Unoriginal, can't stand bitch made niggas
Ice Cube, you'se an actor not a muthafuckin' killa
What neighborhood you from? what dirt you ever done?
When the shit goes down you the first one to run
Every time you talk got a mouth full of drama
Only mission you done is going to church wit'cha mama..
You got the Real-a Swingi' of my nuts Cube Killa
Break yourself niga, huh! Give a lick-a you ain't a killa
You a busta muthafucka bitch made niggas
I never trust ya --Cube's "Can't trust 'em"--
Hoes like you can't figure out where you're from
Are you from South Central, the Westside or Compton?
Mack 10, the only thing you hoggin' on
Is Ice Cube's nuts now he's all in your guts
You wanna be like him but you got no skills
If he's the king you must be the queen of the Hill
But I shank the Cube's fat neck cause "A Bitch Iz A Bitch"
And a bitch don't get no respect
No doubt Westside connections means
Ice Cube's stickin' his dick in Mack 10's mouth (Aahhh!)
All of your homies are down wit' my clique
Why you always gotta be bitin' my shit
And you don't know one bitch on my dick
But yours is best get a blood test for your kid
Only bangin' you done was with toy figures
Your mama wouldn't let you hang with real g niggas
Bring your clique on you wanna scrap
So let's get it on (bullets for some chingazos, ese!)
Mack 10 I give you a year I guarantee
You'll realize that you're getting' fucked and you'll run to me
You pretty little trick, you look real sweet (Mmmm!)
I should make you one of my hoes like Cube was for Eazy
Doughboy, you're fuckin' around wit' the real Cuban
I'm no fictional Scarface movie land bullshit, actor, studio gangsta
You should win an award For most outstanding wax banger
Fuck what you been through, what you're going through
East Side family, nigga What you wanna do?
Eastside!
That's right nigga!
East muthafuckin' side
'Til' we die, nigga!
Fuck all you punk ass niggas!

ياعم يابتاع الحشيش، انا عايز حشيشة طرية
أستنى يا بي ريل، دا الواجب دا عليا
الحشيشة اللي في جيبه غير الحشيشة اللي في ايديا
الحشيشة اللي في جيبه غير الحشيشة اللي في ايديا
ونصطبح أنا وأنت ونولع الدنيا
ونشرب سطفا حلوة ونسميها: كايروفورنيا

You're lookin' at the last of a dyin' breed
Weeded up, please, speed it up
Sittin' in the Cali sun heated up
Inked arm needled up
Rocket style, Don Cheadle'd up
I put the fear of God in people, what
People lookin' at me sideways like I'm on the verge
Like them on the purp that's blazed, I don't say a word
You don't wanna follow me, son
You ain't got the nerve
You just wanna swerve with a little herb, absurd
Got you paranoid in the paragraph when I paraphrase
Got a pair of Jordan's dancin' on your fuckin' face
Paralyzed, see the paranormal paratroops
Summoned by the Grandmaster as he prepares to loose
Temple doors open up, smoke billows out
Now you hoping, what, for mercy? Get your soul brilloed out
From another hood, you ain't really fuckin' with our brotherhood
Even if another could, I wish a motherfucker would
Clip it up or sip it up
Listen, I prefer to trip it up
Chem skippy ya'll bitter fucks
I can take a bigger chunk
And if I'm callin' dark figures up
Don't make a move, they light triggers up
Muggs, cut 'em up, chka-chka, what, huh
(This is for the-)

خليك سايق

Ever heard of me?
Wicked as you ever seen
Heavy on the throttle
Smoke when we hit the scene, rollin' unseen
Under the cover of night
Spirit flying free, niggas higher than a kite
You got nothing on me, we some nomads
And my clan goes way back to the Cro-Mags
Run together, unbreakable bloodline
Too much to fuck with when all the brothers combine
Everything you ever heard of is not a myth
Crazy dogs you don't ever wanna deal with
Which smell? It's the hash that we left around
Smoke a whole pound when I feel myself comin' down
Live how I wanna live and answer to no one
Similar to the ways of the shogun
Think again before you try and come and get me
Or you'll be shot up by a gang of gypsies (shot)

Let's kick it, ese

Comin' out the slums, it's the hoodlums!
I'm pullin' my gat out on all you bums
So bring it on when you wanna come fight this
Outlaw, kickin like Billy Ray Cypress Hill
Chill, I'll bust that grill
Grab my gat, and load up the steel
And if you wanna get drastic
I'll pull out my plastic Glock, automatic
Synthetic material, burial plots in order
Headed down to the Mexican border
Smokin' that smelly, Northern Cali
Gonna put a slug in Captain O'Malley
Ho, hum - hear the gat come, boooooommmmmm!
Let me see what you'll do
It's a sin to kill a man
But I'll be damned if I don't take a stand

We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out!
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out!

We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out!
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that!
I'm high strung, click I'm sprung
'Cause I don't live on the humdrum
Where I'm from, the gats be smokin'
I'll be damned if you think I'm jokin'
Know that I'll come with the static
Erratic, .45 automatic
Screamin' at ya, the red light's beamin' at ya
No need to have to run after
The punk ass hook, in the oven I'll cook
Dig the grave for the one who got played
Now he's under, don't make Stevie Wonder why
'Cause he'll testify

We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out!
We ain't goin' out like that

We ain't goin' out!

We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out!
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that!
I got you thinkin', "What the fuck is this?"
Lettin' you know I take care of business
Can I get a witness?
To verify when I depict this style
That makes you ecstatic
Tragic, when I get a poof of the magic buddha
When I roll with my crew
I betcha one time can't find my hootah
In my vehicle with the belt unbuckled
Pig rollin' up but he ain't that subtle
Pulled to the curb, so we exchange a few words
But he got me stirred up, enough to grab the handcuffs
I'll huff-n-puff and blow ya head off!

We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out!
We ain't goin' out like that

"Bitch-ass motherfucka! Peter Pie ass nigga! Stand on your own two feet, bitch! How the fuck you gon' bite somebody else's dick, nigga? Yours ain't long enough to put in your mouth! What's up with that shit?"
(Background): "'Turn that shit up louder!'"
"Muggs, make it rough."

So many fools swingin' from my sack
Let's talk about the one who had my back!
Down in the west coast, so lemme kick it
To the motherfucker who calls himself "wicked"
No rest, no peace, no sleep
Doughboy rolling down the hill 'cause it's so steep
Jackson... lemme figure out the name
Jack cause you be stealing other niggas' game! (Lying-ass motherfucker!)
But I'm the wrong nigga you wanna fuck with
On my dick so hard, now ya wanna suck it!
Go on the head, gobble up the nuts
Get your lips ready & tear this motherfucker up!
Talk about Eazy, correct yourself
Cube, better step back and check yourself!

"Yeah, nigga! My homie thought he had a homie in you. He let you listen to our motherfuckin' cut, and you turned around and put some old "Friday" shit out. What kind of shit is that?"

Hmmm... let's talk about this
First solo album on the east coast dick
The east coast niggas all showed ya love
Especially the one known as King Sun
He tried to warn us niggas about ya
But nobody would listen
Even began dissin'
Two albums later, you callin' my crew
All because you wanna be Cypress Cube (No way, motherfucker!)
Shoulda known you couldn't hang in the alley
Good boy went to school out in the valley
Fuck it, lemme make this understood
Speakin' on mama's little Boy N the Hood
No Vaseline
Just a rope and a chair and gasoline (burning your ass up!)
Lench Mob is a friend of mine
But you talk about them niggas from behind
"You know what a chazzer is, O'Shea?
A motherfucking pig that don't fly straight"
Where ya gonna run to? Where ya gonna hide?
Taadow! Look at who's waiting outside! (Cypress, motherfucker!)
"I got a can of kick-ass wit' your motherfuckin' name on it, Cube. You wanna come collect it, or should I bring it to you? 'Cause all that bullshit you doin', ain't shit fly about that shit... motherfuckin' thing, and I ain't bullshittin'. You need to back the fuck off, and that's real. Kick rocks buster!"

Natural Born Bullshitta
Lemme hit ya with a dose of reality when I get wit' ya
Your homie came knockin', he had to chain my suit
You put a pipe on your cover, even though you don't smoke Buddha
Let me take you down under on a plane
Where everybody was going insane
Took a look at the Real one: afro gone
The next morning, you didn't have yours on
How many ways will you bite my shit?
Would ya wet me or start throwing up a set?
Caution, when you enter the zone
Never used to bang 'til you heard the microphone (Studio gangsta!)
I got Cube melting in a Tray
Pulling up his card and fucking up his "good day"
Unoriginal rap veteran...
The nigga who say he don't steal from his friends ("I don't steal from my friends!")
Don't trust that nigga named O'Shea
Fuck him, and send him on his way!

Cypress muthafuckin' Hill, the hardest mothafuckin' posse there is out here, nigga. So how d'you figure you was gonna step to this? Yeah nigga, the big damn-wham-bam Cypress Hill, tibby-tibby-toe fool, all for your mothafuckin' dope! Nigga, you can't hang with the Hill! What the fuck you was thinkin' about? You know you step to this, you gotta step correct, 'cause Cypress ain't havin' that shit. Yeah nigga, we crack and fuck you next, who gives a fuck, a mad fuck?

"You know, people just don't...
People just don't see
How much work is really involved in this rap shit
I didn't know it, I didn't see it
I never saw it until I was actually in it
You really gotta be in it
To understand what it's like
But you always gotta
People always gotta see you smile
You always gotta put on that fake...
You know what I'm sayin'?
No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right"

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

I remember the days when I was a young kid growin' up
Lookin' in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
To rock crowds, make money
Chill with the honeys
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me
Shit's funny
How impossible dreams manifest
And the games that be comin' with it
Never the less you got to go for the gusto
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears
And losin' some of your peers
And losin' some of your self
Through the years past, gone by
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac and the brainiac
Don't know how to act
Shit's deep
48 tracks
Studio gangsta mack
Signed a deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil'
But never will
'Til he crosses over, still
Fillin' your head with fantasies
Come with me
Show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese
You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games
But the price of fame is high
And some can't pay to play
Feelin' trapped in
What you rappin' about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The route you took started collapsin'
No fans, no fame
No respect, no change
No women
And everybody shits on your name
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

When you sign to a record label
You don't know you sign your life over
And these white boys don't care about you
'Cause the minute you fall off
They'll find another Noreaga
And they'll find another Capone-N-Noreaga
And they'll find another B-Real
So you need to just keep
Stack your chips up
Do what you gotta do while you hot
And motherfuckin' get out the game
Just stick to the drug game
It's even worse because in the drug game
If somebody jerk you
You can shoot 'em and kill 'em and
If you, in this game if somebody jerk you
You gotta be humble
No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right
You gotta approach people
You gotta be on the up and up
And everything's gotta be all good
When you see someone, slap hands with 'em
You know what I'm sayin'
Give 'em a pound or whatever it is, you know
But you always gotta act like it ain't shit

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

My own son don't know me
Sittin up in the hotel room lonely
But I thank God I'm wit my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or videos
Cuz they show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like Monie
And the press say that
My own people disown me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honies at The Palladium
Who just wanna cling on and swing on
And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar
Wit no shame give him a year
And they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one
Who came before him
Gained fame
Started gettin ignored
I warned him
Assured him
This ain't easy take it from Weezy
Sleezy people wanna be cheesey
They talkin evil
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house, five cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar

Let me dip into my pocket for my fat weed sack

In the sky, with the indo cloud in my brain
Where the fuck are my zig-zags and my lighters?
So I can roll it and set it on fire
Damn, I wish I had scissors cause the shit is so sticky
That it's gettin on my fuckin fingers
But it's smokeable, double tokeable
I got the one-hitter quitter bombay shit that's tokeable
I wanna do a joint venture
Let me make sure there ain't no lump in the god damn center
Impregnated lookin joint, fuck it
I can smoke it and I still get faded

Roll it up, light it up, smoke it up
Inhale, exhale
"I'm the freaker, the one freaks the funk" {*repeat scratch 4X*}

(East Coast hittin that blunt), West Coast hittin that honeydip
Marijuana joint, then I want another hit
Roll it up, (light it up), smoke it up
I wanna stimulate my mind (so I toke it up)
Can I get a hit? (Can I get a hooh!?)
Gimme that fat bag of weed and the brew
So I can get faded, elevated
Smoke the joint down to a roach then I ate it
I stand true to the yesca, mota
As I keep runnin from the Chota
Gimme dat weed fool and ya zig-zags

Ayy, I'm ready to get put down on the set
You ready to get put down on this set? (I'm ready to represent the shit)
On this one right here?
You ready to die for this? (I'm ready to die for this, nigga)
What you ready to do? (I'm ready to put in work)
What you ready to do? You ready to get— yeah
Get him, get him, get him!
Yeah, hit him
What set you from now, huh? Huh? What set you from?

Every nigga out there wanna be down with the crew
Some ain't got enough heart, let me ask you
This, would you be down like a soldier
Loyal and do everything I told you?
I can mold you into a warrior
Down for your neighborhood, workin' up to a G with the flavor
Criminal behavior on the mind
When I got your back, you know I got your back each and every time
Throw your set in the air (C'mon)
Wave it around like you just don't care
Throw your set in the air (Throw it up, holmes)
Wave it around like you just don't care

It's time to exit that busta nigga
Get your hands out your pockets and your finger on the trigger
Let one fly, we don't die, we multiply
Throw your set up in the sky
High as you can 'cause you can't fuck with this
Nigga when I got the Glock, you better duck quick
'Cause I ain't havin' it
If you got your gat, you better start grabbin' it, I can handle it
Soy numero uno mero mero
You know I run with Muggs and the perro
Firin' up that heater
When I'm throwin' up a set I got my nina millimeter
Los Scandalous, Killafornia where I'm from
Dum-ditty, dum-ditty, ditty-dum-dum
I'm buckin' on your ass, now you know where I'm from
Dum-ditty, dum-ditty, ditty-dum-dum

Throw your set in the air (C'mon)
Wave it around like you just don't care
Throw your set in the air (Throw it up)
Wave it around like you just don't care
Throw your set in the air (Throw your hood, holmes)
Wave it around like you just don't care (Go, c'mon on)
Throw your set in the air (Give it up)
Wave it around like you just don't care
Nigga, throw your set in the air, nigga, you know what I'm sayin'?
If you're scared, nigga, take your motherfuckin' punk ass to church
'Cause where I'm from, nigga, on the east side
Every motherfuckin' day is a job, nigga
Gotta handle your business, 'cause if you don't
Your motherfuckin' cap will get peeled back
And that ain't no bullshit
If you wanna test a nigga, bring it on nigga, you know what I'm sayin'?
Throw your motherfuckin' set up in the air

Let me take you to the dark side of the moon
Tell mama that you won't be comin' home anytime soon
'Cause I got you under my thumb, nigga, what set you claimin'?
Better be the same set I'm claimin'
Take a look around, countless amount of soldiers
When I'm chillin' on the east side of town
And it won't stop 'til I'm done
Dum-ditty, dum-ditty, ditty-dum-dum

Throw your set in the air (C'mon)
Wave it around like you just don't care
Throw your set in the air (Throw it up)
Wave it around like you just don't care
Throw your set in the air (Throw your hood up)
Wave it around like you just don't care
Throw your set in the air (Give it up)
Wave it around like you just don't care
Yeah, that's right
Straight givin' up the 'hood all day, fool
Cypress Hill, motherfucker, what you wanna do?
Uh-huh, givin' my shit up in your face fool4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"Esto no me gusta. Aquí la gente, la gente no sirve pa' mierda
Aquí yo soy, yo soy Capitán Pingaloca. Y to' mundo aquí
Me sirve a mi o va pa'l carajo. Oye... revolución compadre!"

In the midst of the madness no question, who's the baddest
MC's in the game runnin for the status
Take a few seconds to review the crews
Sittin on top is the Hill lookin over you
Killa Hill Niggas, cream in my dream
Cookin up a scheme for all them big bank figures
The world is yours, but it can be mine and his
Bust you out the frame, I don't give a fuck who it is
Number one mission, opposition
Get thrown sent home in dead position
In the casket, best wishes
At the bottom of the lake, sleepin with the fishes
Full out search for the body
Of the MC's who be comin to disrupt the party
No wins, no ends, no way
That I'm ever gonna let ya come back again!

Check my dramatics, brains get splattered, dreams shattered
Sabas get blasted for words he packaged
Peep the sequence; crab adolescents, on his defense
Power-U niggas talkin fast like Puerto Ricans
What you seekin, son I catch cream like Dominicans
Last Mohican, lyrics I'm speakin, wild as Indians
Tomahawk - Shaolin slang, the violent talk
Upstate New York, where chumps get extorted for Newports
What you thought?
Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
- that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
.. that that that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
- that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back, ease back
Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
- that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again

"Y ya está dicho. Todos los que no les guste mi 'rebote' van a murir
Yo le voy a meter una bala a la cabeza a cualquier maricón
Que no me persiga a mi a la 'singadapuerta'. ¡Oye, hijo de puta!
¡Quiero quemarte la cara!"

Words drop in chant, the cheeky-eyed slant
I'm takin these cannabis plants yo for grant'
Exotic, narcotic, tunes slam soon
From a dune in the desert Mega-Babylon pleasure
Comin out the domepiece, smell my aroma
Warrior nomad, put you in a coma
Comma, llama, smash-crashin your armor
Drama, I'm a, stealth aircraft bomber
Here is where I dwell at the gates o' hell
It ain't where you're from it's where you're in the mentals
And if not yo, credentials are essential
I see reality, few things surroundin me
Three like a spread, precise strikes the lyric
Not frontin or braggin, hundred percent red dragon
Pine fragranced lyrics, the rhymes you can't imagine
The globe-trotter, call me Meadowlark Lemon
Five part criminal, two part felon
- that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
.. that that that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
- that that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
- that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back.. ease back..
Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
- that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger..

"Esto es muy antiguo. Esta dicho! Aquí, la revolución! No se va a ver por televisión
Todos los maricones del norte, que los voy a matar yo
Va a ser aquí en nuestro país. Y todos los 'singao masones'
Que están chingando el mundo. También, van a ver la muerte
De ellos mismos, en las manos de ellos. Un día, va a ser sangre
Mucha sangre. La peste de los cuerpos muertos, van a oír
Que se va a hueler hasta los Estados Unidos, estos cabrones
Que con la democracia, que nos 'tan chingando en el culo
Todos son unos mismos cabrones..."4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
