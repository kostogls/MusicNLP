Turn my mic up
Turn my mic up

(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the left) Fuck it, blackout, niggas!
(Oh, my Lord!) Lower the casket down (Down!)
Sprinkle the ash, or get your ass kicked, pow! (Pow!)
Frown while I shit on your crown, skip town (Town!)
Ground zero, Shapiro, the king cash cow (Cow—Cow)
Do I make 'em say "Wow!"? Strip! (Ow!)
Bow! I sit with the pound, Click, (Blaow!) Blaow!
Click, click, (Blaow!) Click, (Blaow!)
Stop traffic, dropping them classics, flip now
Bitches, I’m making them skip with thou
Art, you don’t really want start, when I growl (Growl)
(Rawr, rawr, rawr!)
Let me come and mop up the knockoffs​
When I pop off and never stop, 'cause
When we do come through, you better lock doors (Pause!)
The wolves wanna eat, peep how they lock jaws
No need to cook up the coke, you see? We cop raw
And if you ain’t had enough—
What in the fat fishes of a phenomenal fahrvergnügen fuck is going on?
Back with the B.A Baracus, callous bang, on another song
I’mma have these niggas nervous
And clipping they nails and dribbling
And witness them, nibble them, like sunflower seed shells
See these scales, got my weight up heavy, like three whales
And I shit on these males, till it's stinkin'
Fouler, than a weed smell, nigga, your tree fell
See how they Twitter, Facebook and Instagramming an email?
Talking I'm sick, I got them shook and I bang 'em at retail
Until they cripple, see I cook, like I’m slanging a weed sale
Until I triple bred, and whoop ‘em and drag 'em like females (*Gasp!*)Oh, see well, these niggas already know
The way that I fuck shit up, minus the details, the case is shut
Your bitch remind me of replacement butt
Kind of an ancient slut, it's going down
Like she was a basement fuck
Swell up this shit, like I’m sticking steaks in they gut
So gracefully and graciously, I painfully wake niggas up
Ragdolling these niggas, and attacking
Like apes in the cut, I’m waiting for the taking
While I break niggas neck, like a bracelet (Fuck!)
It’s kinda like me having a case in the truck
And drinking ‘til I’m blasted
Harassing and erase a nigga (What!?)
Keeping 'em open and blacking until I’m leaving ‘em stuck
And got ‘em happier, than a child in a park chasing a duck
While I’m chasing a buck
These funny niggas be chasing they luck
I be lacing them up, like boots
When I’m pushing they face in the mud— (Ahh!)
Missiles I fling, while I spit live wire
‘Til this shit circling back around
With more fire for me to melt a brick surfacing back a sound
While I light up shit that'll cause a quick worship
And gather around, it's certain this shit'll splatter cliques
Painful and make ‘em scatter (Blink!)
Shameful, the way I shatter (Split!)
Shit apart, it doesn't matter (Rip!)
Your head up off your shoulders (With)
Bullets bigger than a boulder
And they break ‘em and they know it's (Classic!)
And the way it’s going, you could easily get your (ass-kicked)
See, me and Shady together; we’re crazy
Like baking a vomit and rabies cake, like a pastry bitch
(We that sick!) Like I come from Haiti
I’m suggesting you pay me, don’t make me wanna spaz
(Al-la-la!) Like I’m a crazy Israeli (Bastards!)
While I bite the beat up, and I'm starting to heat up (Yack!)
I’m chopping your foot off
Now it’s mine, and I’m putting my feet up (Black!)
Back to the hood and off to the wild
And I’m hoping you protect your child
And I been blacking out so long
Niggas is asking if the hook had died, nah
But the beat is fried!
Yo
(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on-)
("Yo, chill, man—chill!")
(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the left) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the right) Ayo, calm down, nigga
(Ready on the left) Fuck it, blackout, niggas!
Apparently, there's a light contagiousness to this tirade
It just might make you sick, so irate
With this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg
Is my mind scrambled? 'Cause I'm lit—narrow minded
But go through such a wide range of this emotion
That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
I just pulled up in Clive Davis's driveway
With his personal memoir, saying "He's bi!"
Waving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride
Making him cry, "Rape!"—then arrive naked
And drive straight through the gay pride parade
"Yay! Yippee-Ki-Yay!", 'cause here I—
Wait, did the world just pee on my leg?
And should I take it as a sign
Maybe to take 'em back into time? (Shady!)
I stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave 'em the finger
To take the attention away
From my stinking face it was bringing
Changed the whole complexion of the game
But just in case you was thinking an inkling of replacing
The kingpin of crazy, you're wasting your ink then
So if this is any indication of what you may be facing
You better make a distinction 'cause you fake imitations
Are leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression
That's the worst impersonation I've ever seen, and
Who raps nasally? Eyes hazely?
Rhymes crazily, but sounds like he may
Need some Flonase when he's speaking?
What kind of stupid question is that?
"Hey, Mrs. Abraham Lincoln!
Other than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking
How'd you think that play was this weekend?"
You ain't the real Slim Shady, sit your ass down, faggot (Ew)
See me on a ballot, I'm running for class clown
Rich Democrat, bitch, so I'm just the candidate
To come fuck up the whole party
Me and Flipmode starting a campaign
To have every campus, on a fucking rampage
Act my goddamn age? I am—eight!
So let's get smashed and wake up the next day
With the room trashed, covered in Band-Aids
Glass ashtray smashed
Champagne splashed on the lampshades
But this ain't up for debate, this is undebatable
Shady for president, ho, don't make me go take it back
To the days of old, with Sway & Tech radio
When I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD
I almost fell asleep on the Wake Up Show
Fuck you telling me, fools?
I was rippin' shop, raisin' hell up in Drew's
When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs
Me and Bus put it down, like a sick pet
You're fucking with vets, dog, fucking internet bloggers
"I sit in front of my computer all day
And comment on everything, I'm an expert on everything, Everything sucks—play the next song!"
Guess if I hopped out your freaking laptop, you idiot prick
With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you, I'd be dead wrong
Son of God; I'm the S.O.G
Like a wet log, pores never get clogged
'Cause I'm so full of self-esteem that I sweat fog
Yes, yes, y’all (Wah!)—steady on the left, y’all
Step off, 'fore you get stepped on
Soft? 'Bout as commercial as my fucking Learjet
Jealousy’ll get you green as a Chia Pet
I can see that you’re visibly upset, dog
Alert, alert, girl—alert
Once you enter in my house of pain, you're in a world of hurt
So ("Jump around! Jump! Jump!")
Get that ass shaking ("Jump around! Jump!")
Came to hit you with a fan favorite
But if you too fly for coach, better get them arms
And freaking hands flailing and ("Jump!")
Like Van Halen and pray for a damn tailwind
More afraid of success than I am of failure
So what does that tell ya?
That on a grand scale I don’t give a fuck about nothing
Like Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail
Before he ran straight into the damn railing
"Yo, chill, man—chill!"

Woo! Welcome to the bank
Where you deposit Young Money
And, and you get Cash Money
I'm Tunechi the boss
And live from the vault, is Busta Buss

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Swag mania, pop that goes most, carry the most
Beautiful bitches with us happily toast
Keep the faculty close, gross when we give them a dose
Got them OD-ing, leaning in each Coast
Scenery froze, take notes, rock Rolls, diamonds that fit us
Chanel minks in the winter, who fucking with us?
We coming to give them the shivers, watery flows spilling like rivers
Flooding the street, hoping niggas swimming is moving gorillas
King Kongs, Godzillas when we roll up
Seat filling niggas, get up when we show up

Uhh, shit
Please don't throw up, hold your liquor, grow up
If you robbing niggas, we gon' show you how to blow up
Thank your lucky stars it's the Rap Czar, tuck your shit in
My niggas bite like Rin Tin Tin, my chagrin
You never win, model thin, walking crack in your shin
She gives in every time that I spin
Square up, bow down to the kings of the hall
We wade on, talk shit while we ball so what's cracking with y'all?
Native New Yorker, the slick talker keeps it in order
Call the reporter, stepping like British walkers
Legendary swag flu and see the influence, just see how we do it
Get them into it steadily, God I'm stupid, so undisputed
Act fool, back tool until they pop off
Police crowd up the street, blocking them off, locking them off
Got these niggas wilding while I signal my soldiers
Bossing it up, maintaining composure, stand on the sofa
Thirty bottles, twenty waitresses, bring them over
See how we light up shit, nigga, call the promoter
And tell that nigga bring the bag, better hurry up with it
And count the money up proper, cause you can get it!

I want to thank You, Heavenly Father
Yeah, it feel good, don't it? Uhh
For shining Your light on me
It feel good, don't it? Uhh
I want to thank You, Heavenly Father
Ay, I want to let y'all know
Ay, ay, I want to let y'all know, this Yeezy
For shining Your light on me
And you listening to Q-Tip

Settle up, stiletto up, saddle up and let's go
Good times, only difference, niggas making it though
Chatter is up, peep the way we batter it up
On top of the mountain, folding the ladder up
You dead and done, rip up your paper 'cause your status is none
Transfixed on the strengths of the page, whether chopper or gauge
You're just a single cause you wouldn't engage
Turnt up with the script on the cup, you keep the goblets with us
See how we push sometimes a man fi get kuff?
Beat him in the head, boop-be-de-de-boff, zippity-boof
Beat him in the head again, "Stop killing me, wolf"
Whop, beat a nigga till he drop, piggity-poof
Ock see him, he puss, he don't want no problem with niggas
Fuck it, let's get to drinking, poison our livers
Dammit we sinners, when me and Abstract together, see we deliver
She got me touching it, fucking on all my fingers
Dammit we winners, pillar of this rap shit, homie they know
Kill everything until it's time for me to go
That's when I bomb it with a blow and then I black and get a little bit dummy
The microphone is bleeding, you should take it from me

Incredibly we do it and it resonates the music, iTune it, YouTube it
It could never ever be refuted
It's gnarly for niggas and naughty for ninas, bitches and ballerinas
Ballers and in-betweeners, blatant nonbelievers and overachievers
Kicking it in Pele Adidas, drink Alizé liters
All of you must reconcile a leader
She's begging to eat us and her man's attitude defeat us
But never a scandal because me and Bus, we're prone to handle
We're gentlemen

Not to mention, we're veterans, second, he need some medicine
Before I black as he get off my premises
Better fly, you pelican, idiot ass niggas but then again
You need a suit for your funeral measurements
See me doing it effortless, it's never getting no better than this
Giving your shit to convince a better preference
Watch me turn them to skeletons, see how I come and bring out the betterness?
Time is with it, I rep the foreverness
Flying United Emirates, sized private plane, that kind of etiquette
Purchasing diamonds, handle them delicate
Now you need you a better ref
You could peep us regulating, see we all in this bitch like we ain't never left
I want to thank You, Heavenly Father
For shining Your light on me
I want to thank You, Heavenly Father
For shining Your light on me
I know it couldn't have happened without You
Ooh-ooh, without You
Ooohh, without You
Ooohh, without You87EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah! Guess who it is!
Ayo, Dre, I think they in trouble
Whoo!
Scott Storch, why you have to do it like this to 'em?!
Feels like a new day!

Listen, now every time I come
And I hit you niggas with shit regardless
You get retarded and then niggas ain't got a clue
On how the fuck I do what I do and say what I say
And spit what I spit you ain't never even gotta question who
‘Cause you know that I'm the only nigga that can ever come
And spitefully turn the place in to a motherfuckin' zoo
Then I come and I spit c-crazy sh-sh-sh-shit
And m-m-m-make n-n-niggas do exactly what I want 'em to
From my point of view, instead of trying to step up
You still trying to play catch up
And keep up with the way a nigga grew
These niggas panic and freakin' get schizophrenic
And let they emotions out
And I doubt they can ever test my crew
Take a second, check it, I reckon my records are better than
Whatever record you recorded, that's why your shit is through (Whoo!)
You fuckin idiot, I don't think you get it
I'm one of the greatest ever, period, every syllable is true
Now if you ain't blind
And you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll…

Shit on a mic and do do, my doo-doo, you do not have a fightin' chance to move you, you were covered in my poo-poo
Smothered in my manure while I spit saliva fluid do-do-do-do-do-do g-g-g-goobers are glued to you
You don't have a clue as to what we're about to do, do you?
So just sit back and watch somethin'
You just gon' have an a-chew
You just made me sneeze, I'm allergic to beats like these
Please excuse me, my allergies are actin' up; thanks a lot, Scott
You're probably wonderin' why there's thunder
And everyone is runnin' and duckin' up
Under everything up on the block
‘Cause Busta Bus and Flipmode just tip toed into the club
Then with Shady quietly trying not to start up a riot with Doc
But since we all been spotted
We might as well have a party
So gather 'round everybody, come on, let's get our drink on
And you ain't got to do nothin' special for this occasion
Just reach in the closet, put something on, and get to the club
Now if you ain't blind
And you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll…

Catch you niggas and snatch you niggas
You bunch of bumblin' fools
Who got me rumblin' dudes all the way down the block
Keep on stumblin' and jumblin' over their words and vowels
Throw in the towel, see you niggas is on the clock
And you runnin' out of time, see, I'm tired of all y'all
M-m-m-mumblin-m-m-mumblin', n-n-nigga I got it locked
Every single time you put my shit in your CD player
And turn up the volume
You bang your head, because your shit is not
I continue with crumblin' niggas and tumblin' niggas
You struggle while I humble a nigga with the Glock
Then I watch you while I'll keep on fumblin'
While I got you tr-tr-tremblin'
Before one of my niggas bust your head with a rock
Before I start to do another thing
Then to make you crown me the king
With such a butter swing, nigga, follow the flock
Now watch my brother bring all my diamonds to summer bling
While I'm climbing and fuck her
Then tell you bitch to get off my yacht
Now if you ain't blind
And you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough, think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try
No matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
‘Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll…48EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Just look over your shoulders, honey
Yeah, I know, it's been a minute
Don't you know?
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Whenever you need me
Just look— Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Yeah, you need me (Woo)

I wrote my first bars in the car with Stacy
How bizarre, my battle scars at large would lace me
Big marbles, nigga
I lead this new generation, boy, don't argue with us
Marvelous beat selectors, authors, and novel spitters
And it's all for the literature
And it's all for the hideous, the nastiest flows, the Chlamydia, uh
I ain't afraid to say I need you, ah, yeah (Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop)
I promise I'd never leave you, ah, yeah
My life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes I write
For sure, my folks unite soon as the flow get nice
The poltergeist that scare emcees, my prototype for every
My share of deeds and R.I.P.s
You know my type of style is like my everything
Apparently, my appetite stay famished
Bite no hand that feed
The culture vulture die and bleed
My focus hold these thoughts and dreams
Control this pen (Look over your shoulder)
Boldest lines of rhymes and things
Devote my time and mind it seems
I'm 'posed to shine, remind I'm king
Provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
The pros, the cons, the diamond rings
I'm full with time but I'ma bring
The soul divine and cross between
What's yours and mines, the gold, the green
The ropes that show just what it mean
Then grab Shakur right by the wing
And fly before my vocals (Scream)
For hip-hop, look at my Ziploc
Bag full of goodies, you Chris Rock
Hit the Pookie and pit stops
Since tube socks, baby, you a hell of a drug
Just look over your shoulders when they fuck you over, it's love
I know ya (Woo)
Don't you know, baby?
Don't you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Whenever you need me
Just look— Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Yeah, yeah, you need me (Woo)

Shhh, look over your shoulder, get me?
'Cause I done bodied the game to the point niggas scared to rap with me
Kept burnin' 'til they anointed me one of the kings of Black history
And yes, I see the game is a little different, niggas lack simply
Them bars and I spit 'em like darts 'til they puncture your kidney
You trash and it don't matter how much you gon' try to convince me
And you gon' make my gun cock and talk a whole 'nother way, yo
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh (Woo)
I am the Buddha, the Ali Baba, the believer-er maker
So pristine, the dice roll from under my sleeve when I shake 'em
So rude, I'm so ice cold but I'm what you need to just wake 'em
All them crowns and medals on the wall waitin' for me to just take 'em
When I arrive, my theme music got a pound to it
And when I leave, even my shadow got a sound to it
'Cause I'm the god of the harder, the martyr, the father
I spit a saliva that's leaking a lava
Completin' the saga while meetin' and greetin'
And beating you niggas, completely conquer
Extremely bark on a nigga, you see me
And deeply carve up a nigga, believe me
Graffiti your armor, you heebie, you jeebie
Bikini your broad up (You guinea pig)
See me, now give me the startup and treat me
You greet me and meet me with arms up
So sweet when I speak, have a seat, it was deep
I was sleep, now the god's up, hmm
Upholding the fundamentals, while most of you boast a rental
Focus on what's most essential, spit bars to provoke your mental
Do I have your entendimiento?
While I clap these raps like thunders
Look over your shoulder, boy, and wonder (Woo)
Don't you know, baby? (Ooh, woah)
Don't you know, baby? (Mhm, oh, yeah)
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Whenever you need me (When you need me)
Just look— Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me (Whenever you need me)
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Yeah, you need me (Woo)
Don't you know, baby?
Don't you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey
Whenever you need me

That's right
He got catalog, you understand? (Just look— Just over your shoulders)
This is the motherfucking human iPod out this motherfucker, okay?
He can go all day (Go all day)29EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Now it's finna be some energy, we got the remedy
I'm in the vicinity of a nigga that can spit it with me
Feel the fire whenever we act up
Everybody else is incompatible with the artillery
So forget about it when you hear about it
Cause it's too fast when I pass the baton to Busta
Hit a victim in the middle of the body with a bullet and a rhythm
Every murder is a structure
Every time I hit you niggas with another jam be blacking
I be sounding like a nigga full of anger
Now I'm back to beat you in the head, I'll bring another banger
With my nigga Twist, everything we do be up to wanger
You don't really, really wanna see the way that I come
And I'll give it to you, get up on the ceiling see a nigga numb
Do it how I wanna do it 'till I make another nigga drop
I put my money on it, homie, I'm the one
Go on here, pick it up, carry it the way you wanna carry it
Do whatever you wanna do
Show the competition how we gunning too when we coming through
Better never let a nigga never get in front of you
I wanna be, up in the front, wanna get in
The race, I'm so fast they call me Flash
Don't nobody really wanna
We can hit 'em like a couple of millimeters
Woopin' a niggas' ass
Skibbedy boop, skibbedy bop, skibbedy beep
I'm skipping all over on another Just Blaze hit
Now I know a lot of y'all been sitting, waiting and wondering
Was we ever gonna do this shit
And then we came to hit 'em with another flow
Pop champagne, celebrate and kill another show
Gotta campaign, the greatest niggas, y'all already know that
Never do this kinda shit, Twista, get 'em, gotta go
Now I gotta ask y'all
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Now try to catch me if you can
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Now try to catch (Now try to catch me)

Kill everybody cause I'm gunning outta stress
If I'm running outta breath, he gonna pick up where I left off
Keep him with me when he spitting cause the flow be the bidness
I'm a menace when I bust a lyrical tec off
Go faster than Ricky Bobby, kill him in Talladega Nights
Niggas try to get up, when a nigga hit up
When it I come I promise you gotta pay the price
Look, why don't everybody wanna come and try get a little taste
Of the shit I got, let me put it all up in your face
When I spit it I got a nigga wilding all over the place
Everybody better listen here
Cause you know when I bring him I will never, never stop
Make a nigga rewind and bring it back to the top
Throw the shit up in the streets and I be running every block
Everybody better stand clear
Like a millimeter when I be booking the track up
Motivated for murder whenever I act up
A couple of phenomenal niggas can stack up
Gets anybody that wanna live in the back up
Killing everybody when I bust a clip off
Cause I'mma be attacking them with the insane flow
Then I be having them calling me Twista Phelps
And my nigga Buss like Usain Bolt
Shocked a nigga like I was a thousand volts
Now I'm sailing on the beat the way I'm sailing on the boat
The way I gotta kill 'em and the way I gotta flow
You don't really wanna test me, boy, cause I'll pop ya
When I'm in the spot you know you can't leave
I spit every word 'till, damn I can't breathe
You never heard 'till you nosebleed
Twista, please
Now you know I got ya
Now I gotta ask y'all
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?

Now try to catch me if you can
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Now try to catch (Now try to catch me)

You can talk about it with a bunch of people
They all say that I'm a lyrical manifestation of rhythm
Then I come and do the shit I gotta do and then I bang ‘em
And get 'em and do it every single time I hit 'em
When I do it it just gotta be accurate
I am attacking the rhythm with such a vocal tenacity
See the way a brother blacking in back and in front
Cause every time we in the place we fill it to capacity
I be coming with it, he be coming with it
And nobody really do it how we do it
And the flow is so fluid it gotta be an anomaly
Gotta be an Odyssey; the prodigy, and I'mma be the one to prove it
Don’t you ever forget it the way we coming
And they sending somebody, gonna probably be needing a medic
So give us the credit in alphabetical order
We coming to slaughter so call out the order see the way we do it
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?
Can you keep up?

We been together for a few years, shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear
I'm always on the road, hardly ever home
Always busy this, busy that, can't talk on the phone
I know you aggravated, walk around frustrated
Patience gettin' short, how longer can you tolerate it?
Listen, Ma, I'm just motivated
I do this for us, stuck on the grind, tryin' to elevate it now
Ayo, to really be honest you stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't even express through words how much the kid loves ya
I'ma stand as a man, never above ya
Well, I could tell that you different from most, slightly approach you
And the ill shit about it? We don't sex every day
But when we sex, we tease in a passionate way
I love the way you touch it, those little elaborate ways
Got the god feelin' released to relax for the day
It's on you, Ma

I feel your love for me, baby, and how it move through you
I been longin' for the moment to talk the truth to you (Listen)
I'm never home, I always get up and go
Puttin' you through the unnecessary rigmarole
I never meant to put a thousand pounds of stress on your head
I love the way we sleep and how we always cuddle in bed
Baby, I stay embracin' your patience, sheddin' your tears with me
I ask you, my mami, please continue to bear with me
We started out broke, constantly on the roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from loosies and buses, and fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed, still got each other back (Yeah, yeah)
Word is bond, never screwed none of these industry cats, boy
We like Scull and Mulder, walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game, watchin' our seeds gettin' older (Yeah)

Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you (I'll give it to you)
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it (Gonna give it to you, boy)
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it

Yes, you know I'll die for you (Uh)
And you know I'll ride wit' you (Come on)
I will always try wit' you (Uh)
And give you my love and cry wit' you (Let's go)
I will climb a mountain high (Uh-huh)
Until our love will touch the sky (Uh)
So baby come and get more close to me (Mariah)
'Cause this is where your love is supposed to be, baby (Tell 'em)
I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini
It's been a few months in PA, you haven't seen me
You lookin' good in that Gucci bikini
38 carats, your ring lookin' freezy
No matter what I do in the world, you never leave me
Fall back, Ma, I'll make your lifestyle easy
I appreciate the things you do to please me
Lookin' at my daughter, you'll never do me greasy

Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you

Hala sheiki, ha lini falla
Mili ha lan shi inni mala
We getting Arab money

Now, there ain't no way that you could kill the beast dead
I got Middle East women and Middle East bread
I got oil well money in the desert playing golf
Dolce shorts, dashiki with a Louis Scarf
Chest cold, diamonds make a nigga wanna cough
In Dubai, 20 million on the villa loft
And then I step up in the club and then these other niggas mad as shit
The way I make the people wanna sing the hook in Arabic!
La ilaha illa Allah, ha la ili, hay yo
Hili b'Allah, hey, hili bay yo
We getting Arab money

Hala sheiki, ha lini falla

Seven star hotels, Maybach, movie sick
Big bitches, knock-kneed camel-toed groupie shit
Women walk around while security on camelback
Club on fire now, niggas don't know how to act
Sittin' in casinos while I'm gamblin' with Arafat
Money long, watch me purchase pieces of the Almanac
Y'all already know, I got the streets buzzin'
While I make you bow down and make Salaat like a Muslim

La ilaha illa Allah, ha la ili, hay yo
Hili b'Allah, hey, hili bay yo
We getting Arab money

Hala sheiki, ha lini falla

See, now I take trips to Baghdad dummy
While I use stacked chips and count Arab money now
I don't need to get fresh, about to grow a beard duke
So much cake even the money look weird too
Domestic bread, and I'm broad, I'm tryna eat right
Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Al Saud
They respect the value of my worth in Mali, Malaysia
Iran and Iraq, Saudi Arabia!

La ilaha illa Allah, ha la ili, hay yo

So then they said, "Oh, so that mean we gon', you gon' switch it on 'em?"

Let me see you all y'all
Busta Rhymes, Flipmode y'all
Nineteen ninety eight y'all
Ha, get down ya’ll
Let’s have a ball y'all

Feelin the heat up in the street rockin the beat
Step up in the club, take me to my reserved seat
Comin around, all of my niggas surround me
So much bottles of liquor, y'all niggas’ll drown me
Makin ya drunk, feelin the funk, blazin the skunk
Stay hittin with the shit that blow a hole in ya trunk
Afraid of us, you know this ain’t no game to us
You strange to us that’s when we gettin dangerous, come on
This, is, serious
We could make you delirious
You should have a healthy fear of us
'Cause too much of us is dangerous
So dangerous, we so dangerous
My Flipmode Squad is dangerous
So dangerous, we so dangerous
My whole entire unit is dangerous5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm gonna find you and make  you want me
Hello rap game, nǐ hǎo, how you durrn'?
I done took my time, now it's time to take my turn
My curses been in verses since my firstest brain cells burnt
But I done been deferred to assistants and interns
And I done been on hold for some years, it's getting old
I'm too blessed to fit the mold, they said press six to give your soul
Or not and you can hold, you ain't never gonna explode
Or expand across the globe, but look like I just skipped the cold
Hello all up in your ear, you should hear me loud and clear
We was not allowed in here, and now we smoking loud in here
How we in the game and they ain't put a chain on them
Cleaning in that thing and my Sprite don't got a stain on it
Lil Xan fuck the Chance up, Donnie Trumpet said bands up
Donnie McClurkin said stand up
I know contracts are like handcuffs
I know combat when it's hand to hand or with handguns
I know answers, I know man to man, can't stand us
I know exactly how you wanna brand us
I take campers to the campus fix the trips and get the bus
Fast like Twista mixed with Bust
When Windy lost boys I had pixie dust for a pick me up
Spit shine 'til it's crystal clean like Listerine from a Dixie cup
Mama Jann band-aid kiss the cut
Now I'm thinking about offices and mansions with amenities
And runneth over pools and infinities
Award shows and house wives and games shows and Hennessy
It's different from the energy I see being in your vicinity
Mistaken identity, you behaving differently
(Ayo Chance, don't stop now nigga)
You the protest you the marches
You on the forefront you the farthest
You the melanin in the darkness
Wrong number what a shame
You and I look just the same
That's why I got you in my name
Lets push it to the masses give them wavy, give them Surf
One time shout-out to Bust, I know this a long ass verse
But I'm just getting started I'm taking this rap shit global
Put my music in the museum, put my bars in Barnes and Noble
Shape the office like an oval, make the triangle a circle
Teach the little boys and girls, tell them I was your referral
I'm Chicago like a gyro, I'm Chicago like some harolds
I will borrow from the Boroughs , show tomorrow to the world
Place the urban and the rural, make the wall into a Mural
Lead it where it need to be, they jocking like a Nitti beat
Now they cannot get rid of me, bye, bye to the industry
Lionel Richie is it me? hello?
(Chance The Rapper sing it to 'em)
Is it me you're looking for?
Gonna find you
And make you want me

Bust Rhymes it come with the force and lay it across
Hit you like I'm playing lacrosse
And if it was July I'd drop it on the day of the fourth
The fire make you bust a shot
Pull a string and get lost
Stinging guitars (Hello)
I'm here with the floss
A chain with a frost
While the yellow diamonds shine with a gloss, I'm cold (ah)
Shit heavy like we weighing a horse
Violate, one shot will turn your brain into sauce
Just pray I remorse
Nigga you know we whip from the start
You slept on the art
Bugging on how we put out your spark
We separate the heat from corny shit and kept it apart
Step on a dart, spit will test the rest of your heart
No rest in the dark (hello)
We the best of the sharks, we love and we fart
And leave a mark so put it in park
Whenever we bark, we make you come and get with this nigga
Get next to this nigga, we past professional
You can call me a specialist nigga
We fuck shit up while you call me the best at this nigga
The way we put it down you'll be calling a censorship nigga
We holding a higher rank and we holding it back
And I'm grimey niggas home when they shank
Or they clickity clank (hello)
Now just clap from front to back and just react (what?)
Like you know you posted till you die it is the feeling (what?)
Keep on clapping get to acting up now keep on packing (what?)
All inside (is high) now feel the fire in the building
You can never test the way I do it
And the way I be moving and bouncing and
Shaking and shouting and breaking a mountain
And making the noise that I be making everytime
That you be hating, sorry for keeping you waiting
(Real talk) shit
And I see a lot of y'all couldn't cope while
I hit you with another banger after the fact
If you want me to go a little crazier
Than this then (bududududu) what's faster than that?
(Hello) And I ain't going no where
It's me, Busta Bust
Smooth Chance The Rapper
Text move big up
Just know
God got his hand on us
I feel so good about me
Trust this
We good over here
I pray that you're good over there
(Hello) we don't lose
But by losing us
That might be a significant loss for you16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
