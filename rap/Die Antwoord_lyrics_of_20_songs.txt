Banana brains, you're the apple of my eye

Baby girl, you so fine

Look at you, coochie coo
Juicy, tushy, gushy goo
Booby one, booby two
Bouncin' like a Looney Tune
Booty boomin', cookie juice
Gushin' out your coochie boo
You're so cute, like Pikachu
Ain't no one so sweet like you
I was sad, then you sneaked into
My lonely heart like peek-a-boo
Now every time I think of you not by my side I dry my eye
Just wanna sing lullabies to my little butterfly
Banana brains, you're the apple of my eye
Stay with me tonight
'Cause I'm having the best time of my life
Banana brains, you're the apple of my eye
Stay with me tonight

Baby boy, you so cool
How can I stay mad at you?
I love you and that's the truth
You so silly, you so stupid
You the best, I never want you to stress
Everything gonna be cool, wait and see
Just hold my hand and stay with me

B-B-Baby girl, you been there for me
Through thick and thin with cool energy
You cared for me, yeah, defended me
Helped me defeat my e-e-enemies
Life is weird, it keeps testing me
No other girl in the world impressing me
Like you do, you voodoo fresh to me
You just wanna be different, get the best of me
Everything's meant to be, you were sent to me
You and me got wild destiny
You're like a little angel won't ever pressure me
E-e-everything you do's so zef to me
I love it that you best friends with me
I just wanna treat your heart carefully
'Cause everyday I feel blessed to be
The one chillin' with you right next to me

There once was a little girl
Who had a crush on a bad, bad boy
But when that bad boy got out of prison
That little girl's ass was in big, big trouble

Daai bra Anies, hy's 'n fokken gam bra
Haai! Daai Anies, hy lam innie mang, ja
"Ken sy my nommer?" Xha! Boy, what's your number?
Twee ses? Twee sewe? Of is jy n ag bra?

Throw them devilish gang signs in the air
Start giving it up for little evil me
My fingers are green 'cause I'm a mean dope fiend
I'm wicked like a mad D.O.G
Fresh like a little dark G.O.D
Yo-Landi Vi$$er got the hypest flow
Start talking in tongues whenever I get stoned
Motherfucking minds get blown
Every time I rap into the microphone
My zef accent is very foreign
When I speak overseas they go "I beg your pardon?"
You can't get me, like Eric Cartman
Naughty little kitty go "meow"
Yes daddy, I'm a big girl now
Jas little devil make your dick go "wow!"
Yeah, boy, Yo-Landi Vi$$er is hot stuff
Daai bra Anies, hy's 'n fokken gangsta
Haai, daai Anies, hy lam innie mang, ja
"Ken sy my nommer?" Xha! Boy, what's your number?
Twee ses? Twee sewe? Of is jy 'n ag bra?
Daai bra Anies, hy droom innie mang, ja
Van my punani, ja, jy's lekker jas, bra
Vinger in jou hol in, nxa! Haal uit die ganja
Ja pakkie zol in! Klap dit soos 'n rasta

I rhyme tight! Tight, tight, tight!
Spark mosh-pit shit 'cause I rhyme so hype
Put me in front of someone I don't like
I go punch! Kick! Bite! Fight!
I'm cray-cray like O.D.B
Yo-Landi down with O.P.P
I smell lovely 'cause I don't eat meat
Too much bubbly then I go pee-pee
Look out here I come, little evil me
I got a itchy little need for speed
Rap on the beat like a high-speed chase on
I gooi rooi! No motherfucking brakes on
All these pop songs sound like the same song
I burn them! Ja motherfucker, flame on!
Bow down to her motherfucking majesty
No rapper out there as bad as me
Sny jou koekie!
Sny-sny jou snoekie koekie!
Cut it-cut it, hey kitty kitty kitty!
Cut it-cut it, hey kitty kitty kitty!
Sny jou koekie!
Sny-sny jou snoekie koekie!
Cut it-cut it, hey kitty kitty kitty!
Cut it-cut it, hey kitty kitty kitty!

Daai bra Anies hy's 'n fokken gangsta
Haai, daai Anies hy lam innie mang, ja
"Ken sy my nommer?" Xha! Boy what's your number?
Twee ses? Twee sewe? Of is jy 'n ag bra?
Daai bra Anies hy's 'n fokken gam bra
Daai bra Anies hy's vars uitie mang ja
Wys hom punani, waar's jou cookie thumper?
Gee hom punani, maar hy soekie bum, bra!
Daai bra Anies hy's 'n fokken rou bra
Ek blom met Anies lekker oppie sofa
He love Yo-Landi 'cause I'm blonde all over
Maar yoh! Daai Anies hy hou van my boude!19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Boom!

Showtime! Motherfucker, it's on
Apocalypse now, I'm dropping this bomb
You can't fuck with this song
I'll stick to this splif, I'm not klapping this bong
I'm a wild child, I don't wanna go to bed
Uh shit, sorry man, I'm stoned again
Wooh! Now everything's getting so psychedelic
When I'm doos dronk and I forget all my fokken lyrics
Like um... uh... who gives a fuck?
Don't worry 'bout it, just blow a kiss to me
I like danger, romance, and mystery
I'm a lucky ducky, get mad shit for free
I rock more bling than Mr. T
I make it look easy 'cause it is to me
My daddy says it's lekker fokken spif to see
A South African cherrie making history

Baby's on fire
She got me going fucking crazy, soos a mal naaier
Oh jirre! God se Jesus!

Oh jirre! God se Jesus!

My bodyguard help me get to the bar
Neill Blomkamp's making me a movie star
A lot of bad boys wanna piece of me
If you're lucky, boy, I'll let you sneak a peek
My zef style's motherfuckin' freaky-deak
I don't got beef 'cause I don't eat no meat
I'm on some other shit, yo, I know I speak unique
Fuck your whole shit up when I freak the beat
I love it when Kimmy talks sweet to me
C'mon, c'mon, Kimmy, Kimmy, speak to me
I take a trip down memory lane
Like, "Yo, fuck 15 seconds of fame"
I'm a young blood coming up fresh in the game
Yo-Landi Visser, motherfucker, yo remember the name

Baby's on fire
She got me going fucking crazy, soos a mal naaier
Oh jirre! God se Jesus!

Aaah, freak out!
No need to get so deep
Nothing quite like a motherfuckin' techno beat
A techno beat— a techno beat
A techno— a techno— a techno beat
Just say "what's up?", don't try to get so deep
You know me, maar ek ken jou nie
Ek ken jou nie, ek ken jou nie
Ek ken jou— ek ken jou— ek ken jou nie

Physically fit, the Ninja very energetic

Got a offshore account for the dollar bills that I stack
Yo fuck rap! I'm sorry my china we not related

There's a rumble in the jungle, I'm bubbling to the beat

Round the corner gooi n lekker spif, Tokyo Drift
My daddy told me there's a lot of fish in the sea
There's also a lot of motherfuckin' money, bitches and weed
Ja, dagga dagga dagga! Puff puff puff!
Bring the beat back Hi-Tek!

We drop the type of beats that got you fuckin' stuck in a trance
In the overseas they like to say you stuck in a trance
We drop the type of beats that make you fuckin' cum in your pants

I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

I'm a ninja, yo
My life is like a video game
I maintain when I'm in the zone
One player, one life on the mic limited time (Yo Ninja, go!)
No fucking around I'm cutting down anyone in my path
Trying to fuck with my game with razor sharp lyrical throw stars
Here my flow's hot
Ho$$tyle
Wild, out of control
Ninja skop befokte rof taal
Rough rhymes for tough times
Met fokol kos, skraal
Till I hit triple seven at the ATM
Straight famine or feast
When you living on the razor edge
Stay sharp sharp
Rolling with the $0$
High energy
You never seen Zef so fresh
Uh! When we mic check Hi-Tek flows flex
Yo we optimistic, not fuckin' depressed
We not like the rest
My style is UFO
Totally unknown
You can't fuck with my new Zef flow
I'm hard to miss
"You can't do this, you can't do that"
Yo, fuckin' who said so?
I do what I like
Too hot to handle
Too cold to hold
You can't fuck with the chosen one
I-I-I-I-I want the knife
Yo I'm a Ninja
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

Ninja is poes-kool
But don't fuck with my game, boy
Or I'll poes you
Life is tough when I get stuck
And my time is up I push through
Till I break-break-break on through to the other side
Fantastically poor with patience like a stalker
Ninja is hardcore
Been cut so deep, feel no pain, it's not sore
Don't ask for kak or you'll get what you ask for
I'm like a wild animal in the corner
Waiting for the break of dawn
Trying to get through the night
Just a man with the will to survive
My blades swing free
Decapitate a hater
With amazing ease
This is not a game, boy
Don't play with me
I work my mic-saber like a wild fucking savage from the dark side danger!
Yin to the yang
Totally Hi-Tek, Ninja's motherfucking big in Japan
I seen the future but I never got nothing in my hand
Except a microphone, big dreams, and a plan
Fly-talking, sky-walking
Like a ninja
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

Fuck this is like...
The coolest song I ever heard in my whole life
Fuck all of you who said I wouldn't make it
They said I was a loser
They said I was a no-one
They said I was a fucking psycho
But look at me now, all up in the interweb, world wide
2009, futuristic
Enter the Ninja
Yo-Landi Vi$$er
DJ Hi-Tek
Die fokken Antwoord
Dis mooi ne?

I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection

Come to the dark side, we have candy
Yes, but do you have coffee?
Sure we have coffee, how do you take it?
Black, like my soul

He likes his coffee black, like his soul
He drinks it scorching hot, like a fucking psycho
He like coffee a lot and he like his coffee now
Fifty cups of coffee and you know it's on

Bang, motherfucker, bang
Ja! Jy's n fokken mal gat
Dumbfucks can't even handle my slang
Skiet jou in jou moeder fokken poes want jy praat kak
Celebrity fuckboy rappers can't hang
Ja! Met n vinger in jou hol in!
Step the fuck back you, whack motherfucker
Like Kanye Kardashian
Yo, I like rats and coffee and weed
And sing whatever the fuck I want to the beat
And I like gats and money and speed
And drivin' like a poes down the motherfuckin' street
And all I wanna do is zoom, zoom, zoom
Bass pump in the trunk, boom, boom, boom
Pitch-black windows
You wanna see me, but you can't
Sippin' on champagne
Puffin' on a blunt
So, how do you feel now that you have your new dark powers?
Aah, feel pretty good, not eh, not scared at all, I just feel kind of, I feel kind of invincible

I non-stop motherfucker
I'm too ill to chill
Too dope to cope
Too lit to quit
You fuck with peanut butter and jelly
She talks shit
My foot kicks your ass
My fists split your lip
My mommy she shut me up with duct tape
Now I get paid for talking all day
Kidding, fok it, let's go full retard
Aw, fuck's sakes, who ate my last cupcake?
I love coffee, but not a fuck
When I drink Starbucks, 'cause Starbucks sucks
Ja! Daai shit proe soos kak! Ek kannie!
Oh man, I'm makin' so much motherfuckin' money
It's making my brain go funny
You put the money in the wallet
Fok it, I can't think, I need more coffee
Kidding, fok it, let's go full retard
No more motherfuckin' milk or sugar, because
He likes his coffee black, like his soul
He drinks it scorching hot, like a fucking psycho
He like coffee a lot and he like his coffee now
Fifty cups of coffee and you know it's on

But, sometimes I get sad, and I cut myself
A piece of cake!
Yo, 'cause, I get the mother fuckin' munchies
Oh, motherfucker, I need someone to eat
Flesh so yummy, bones so nice and crunchy
Hehehe, I dare you to fuck with me
Ah, aren't you just such a cute little lollipop?

All my fuckin' life I lived a normal fuckin' ife
'Til I went an got myself caught up with the mic
And the beats coming dope with the rhymes and the flows
In real life trying to cope with the highs and the lows
I got sick and tired of getting treated like a stupid fuck-up
So I fucked my enemies up one time and blew the fuck up
Before they was like, "Yo, who's this stupid weirdo?
Now it's like, it's a new breed of rap superhero
To defeat these devils, ninja becomes a devil
These god-forsaken wretches will never be on my level
(Wies jy?) Fuck you and your whole crew, I got you stressin'
Double guessin' 'cause I won't do what I'm supposed to
I don't know you, baby say hello to

Mothafuckas tell me to slow my roll, but sorry, no can do
My style is so brand new, I try to make you understand it
I'm here to steal the fuckin' show 'cause, baby, I'm a bandit
Now you standin', lookin' at me like the aliens have landed
(All hail the great white ninja)
Every puss with a phone wants to take my picture
"Ninja! Jas, I dig dat ou!"
Is it real? No, it's just a big black joke
When dealing with an idiot, there's really nothing you can say
Next time you ask me "Is it real?" I'm gonna punch you in the face
To help you feel me, bitch I get paid to be funky
But be nice or I'm gonna change to be ugly
I'm zef like a young Hugh Hef', oh yes
May my enemies live long so they can see me progress
Put the peddle to the metal and I'm scorching my tires

Fuck, I'm so faded
So motherfuckin' faded
In the morning, I'll be fresh as fuck
But your carrer still be faded
Fat faded fuck faces hate it
How'd you get so jaded?
Sorry you never made it
Your flash in the pan career faded
Your legacy's overrated, your new shit sounds dated
You no longer famous, kids don't know what your name is
Something crawled up your anus
And died, that's why your face is so fucked up
Sour taste in your mouth
Your bitch call me the greatest

These fat fuck bitches always trip on me
First down for me, they flip on me
I told your boy, "Your bitch needs to chill" (Bitch need to chill)
Can't handle when shit gets real
You are a nut-case, you a two-face
You on a paranoid crusade
No one cares 'bout what you say (Sorry)
You trippin', listen to what your crew say
Your life's like a permanent E come down
Everyday's Suicide Tuesday
Me, I'm fresh like baby breath
But your sour breath needs toothpaste
I told your boy, "Your bitch needs to chill" (Bitch need to chill)
I told your boy, "Your bitch needs to chill" (Bitch need to chill)
I told your boy, "Your bitch needs to chill" (Bitch need to chill)
Fake bitch, fuck, keep it real
Fake fat fuck
Fuck, I'm so faded
I don't even know what today is
In the morning, I'll be fresh as fuck
Career still be faded
Fat faded fuck faces hate it
How'd you get so jaded?
Sorry you never made it
Your flash in the pan career faded
Your legacy's overrated, your new shit sounds dated
You no longer famous, kids don't know what your name is
Something crawled up your anus
And died, that's why your face is so fucked up
Sour taste in your mouth
Your bitch call me the greatest

How'd you get so fat? How'd you get so whack?
Fuck the fuck off, once you gone whack, you can never go back
Something crawled up your anus and died
That's why your face is so fucked up
Sour taste in your mouth
Your bitch call me the greatest
Fuck, I'm so faded
Someone told you I'm famous
Bitch, don't ask me for a picture
You don't even know what my name is
Motherfuckers testing my patience
Trying to make conversation
Mouth moving but they don't say shit
Get the fuck off my spaceship
I'm on a permanent vacation, blow a kiss to my haters
, I'll see you later, masturbaters

I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me

Long ago I was a little girl yet I was never ever able to fit in
My teachers at school would try to tell me what to do but, yo I would never listen
'Cause I was high all the time, stoned out of my little fucking mind
Misunderstood, lost and confused looking for a sign
All the popular kids at school were always super mean to me and made me cry
I never knew what I should do so I just walked away and said "Fuck off and die"
They said that I'm weird, that I'm ugly, and that I suck
I knew that one day all of those kids would grow up to be boring as fuck

I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me
I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me
I close my eyes and float into the night I like to let my mind drift
Make a jump into a new dimension
Thank God I got that gift
Ever since I was a little kid
Always on that next shit
These whack copycat ball bags can suck my motherfucking dick
Sometimes it feels like coming from this planet people are so sick and twisted
I don't wanna fit in anyway, I'd rather be a misfit
Fuck a normal life, that's lame, me I'm insane in the brain
They laugh at me because I'm different, I laugh at them because they're all the same

I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me
I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me

Ndiyinkwekwe enkulu
Angi funi ukuba yeendota
Evil boy for life!
Evil boy for life! Yebo!
Evil boy for life!
Evil boy for life! Yebo!
Evil boy for life!

Yo, Evil Boy, why is your incanca so big?
All the better to love you with!
No glove, no love;
If you don't believe me
Take your dirty hands off my umthondo wisizwe!
:
Yo-Landi Vi$$er so fancy like this dope-ass beat;
Rock the motherfuckin' microphone with no panties
I'm a bad ass chick, yo: my black magic
Spelletjies make all the boys go, "damn, that's sick"
Lie down on the bed, boy, let me light the candles
Uh-uh, don't touch, Yo-Landi just too hot to handle
Blindfold you, lock your hands up with the handcuffs
Even though you lying down, I can make you stand up
Spirits in the room tickle you like a sneaky prawn
Fuck a pen and pad, I write my rhymes with a Ouija board
Draw a pentagram on your chest with my lipstick
Visions in the mirror: heavy Zef futuristic
Let me take your pants off. Let's see what you made of
Go through your pockets - no, we not gonna make love
Go through your wallet, whoa! Look at all this paper!
What a fuckin' sucker. See you later, masturbator
:
I went from fokol to so fokken hot right now, i'll put you in your place!
Motherfucker, skrik wakker, we coming through, pumping you full of bass!
Fok rustig, eks apokaliptikal, (fucking you in the face!)
Zef cherries tioon my, "spieg my fokken hol nat"
Fuck everyone, eyes on the prize when I go for the jugular
Surprise me or fokof and die when I remind you of how much you suck!
Everyone's so fokken so-so (yo, we've been sent to fuck you up!)
Zef techno mosh-pit gangsta nommer een kind
Everything you rap about comes true if you got some freakin' balls
But mind your tongue when you rhyme on the drum; gaan vra vir Biggie Smalls
I gotta rock if you motherfucking like it or not (yo, is you ready for)
This hostile take over? bow to the fokken master
My slang is banging, I'm freaking the fuck out of myself! yo, I'm my biggest fan
Cause, buddy, when you man down, no fokken hands out when you really need a hand
Machine gun rapper (lekker budda-budda, motherfucker) yo, I'm bigger than
Koos Kombuis se ma se fokken poes!
:
Nana, nanana!
You can't fuck with this, ou!
Blah blah blah, whatever
Watch a million fuckin' kids go:
"nana, nanana!
Super fokken fresh flow!"

Love it when you spread your ass like that, fuck
Like it when you sing (Ninja, kiss my ass)
I love rockin' your ass like a ninja mask
I like it when you come visit me (Hola!)
I like it when you drop to your knees
I like it when I slap you in the face with my dick
Flip you 'round, then we fuck to the beat
I like it when you say (Fuck me anywhere)
Anywhere? (Anywhere, Ninja, I don't really care)
After it she likes it when I snuggle like a teddy bear
Bed wet, legs spread, big mess everywhere

I like it when you wake me up with you
Bougie little Gucci coochie stuck to my face
Like a little alien face hugger, get it funky
I like it when you say (Ninja, fuck me)
I like it that your mind is a mystery
I like it when we fuck and you just leave
Without saying goodbye or trying to kiss me
I like it when you tell me that you miss me (Te extraño)
I like it when we dance in the club
I like it that you don't give a fuck
Yeah, you're dancing with the devil
And you got your panties to one side
Fuckin' you on the dance floor
Back at the crib, I like it when we're fuckin'
And you take it out your pussy and say
(Put it in my bum again)
After it she likes it when I snuggle like a teddy bear
Bed wet, legs spread, big mess everywhere
Even in my bum, even even in my bum
Even in my bum, even even in my bum

Should've known better to fuck with a Ninja with a attitude
I wasn't mad at you but now you're mad at me and jealous

Follow my every move like a sea-point moffie
