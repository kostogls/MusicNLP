You ready? Let's go!
Yeah!
For those of you that wanna know what we're all about
It's like this, y'all, c'mon!

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name (Mike!)

He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard, whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
It's all about reality and making some noise
Making a story, making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's picking it up, let's go

Who the hell is he, anyway? He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leaving 'em star-struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him 'cause he makes a living from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help (Help), or to get some respect ('Spect)
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds to the skill of an artist
This is twenty percent skill (Uh), eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear, 'cause Ryu is ill (Next)
Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames
Then I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method "Name of the Game" (Uh-huh)
Came back, dropped "Megadef," took 'em to church
I like "Bleach", man, Ryu had the stupidest verse (Ha-ha)
This dude is the truth, now, everybody giving him guest spots
His stock's through the roof, I heard he fucking with S. Dot

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

They call him Ryu the Sick, and he's spitting fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer, he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fucking nihilist, porcupine, he's a prick, he's a cock
The type women wanna be with and rappers hope he gets shot
Eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow
Now, the record with Shinoda's taking over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat
Tak, he's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got, making his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name, people keep asking him
"Was it given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?"
No, he's living proof (Proof), got him rocking the booth
He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice (Juice)
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent

Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work, when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head, every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, the kids that he signed?
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name
Yeah! Fort Minor, M. Shinoda, Styles of Beyond
Ryu, Takbir, Machine Shop!111EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

She said, "Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit"
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, working my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing, "Where'd you go?"

Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home
Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine, and I’m planning to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say

And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing, "Where'd you go?"

Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home

When you made me that initial batch of songs
I was like, that's the shit, right there
Holla

Yeah
Welcome, yeah it's been a long minute
Let me break it down now, if y'all still with it
First time I did it, yeah I'll admit it
I kinda hit it and quit it and left y'all hanging
Sang it kinda off key with a passion
Asking, can I give you back that action?
Yeah, I'ma blast in a hashtag fashion
To spell it out for you like a mass closed caption
Get a closed casket, fade to black
This is my spot that I'm taking back
Get at me punk, I was made for that
Y'all don't really even know what you aiming at
So far back, what you waving at?
Ya'll can't see the stage that I'm playing at
Ya'll hating that, but that's why I do it
So tell me where the motherfucking haters at?

'Cause I don't need their blessing, now
I don't need their invitation
Ain't no way to shut me down
Or to take this path I've taken
And maybe I've been left out
Never let this be mistaken
They can keep that blessing now, forget me now
'Cause I was never welcome
Yeah, it's been a long road
Never really know how it all unfold
I'm just trying hard not to sell my soul
When the rest want guns and a mouth full of gold
I don't hate 'em, I still love 'em
That's not me, I'm not judging
Not below 'em, not above 'em
But disrespect me? Well, then fuck 'em
This a house I'm living in
Ya'll just pass through, visiting
I draw these lines, ya'll fill 'em in
I'm a grown ass man, y'all children
No competition, I'm killing them
Talking 'bout him and him and him
Let's take it out for another spin again
And I don't give a fuck if I win again

'Cause I don't need their blessing, now
I don't need their invitation
Ain't no way to shut me down
Or to take this path I've taken
And maybe I've been left out
Never let this be mistaken
They can keep that blessing now, forget me now
'Cause I was never welcome
No (I was never welcome)

"My father, came from Japan, in 1905
He was fifteen when he, immigrated from Japan
He, he, he worked until he was able to buy
To actually build a store"

Let me tell you a story in the form of a dream
I don't know why I have to tell it, but I know what it means
Close your eyes, just picture the scene
As I paint it for you
It was World War II
When this man named Kenji woke up
Ken was not a soldier, he was just a man
With a family who owned a store in L.A
That day, he crawled out of bed like he always did
Bacon and eggs with wife and kids
He lived on the second floor of a little store he ran
He moved to L.A. from Japan
They called him immigrant, in Japanese
He'd say he was called "issei"
That meant first generation
In the United States when
Everybody was afraid of the Germans, afraid of the Japs
But most of all, afraid of a homeland attack
And that morning, when Ken went out on the doormat
His world went black, 'cause
Right there, front page news
Three weeks before 1942
Pearl Harbor's been bombed and "The Japs are Coming"
Pictures of soldiers dying and running
Ken knew what it would lead to
And just like he guessed, the president said
"The evil Japanese in our home country
Would be locked away"
They gave Ken a couple of days
To get his whole life packed in two bags
Just two bags, he couldn't even pack his clothes
And some folks didn't even have a suitcase
To pack anything in
So two trash bags, is all they gave them
And when the kids asked mom, "Where are we going?"
Nobody even knew what to say to them
Ken didn't wanna lie
He said, "The U.S. is looking for spies
So, we have to live in a place called Manzanar
Where a lot of Japanese people are"
Stop it, don't look at the gunmen
You don't wanna get the soldiers wondering
If you're gonna run or not
'Cause if you run, then you might get shot
Other than that, try not to think about it
Try not to worry 'bout it being so crowded
'Cause someday, we'll get out
Someday, someday
"Yeah, soon as war broke out, the FBI came and
They just come through the house and, you have to come
All the Japanese have to go
They took Mr. Ni, the people couldn't understand
Why they had to take him because he's an innocent laborer."

So now, they're in a town with soldiers surrounding them
Every day, every night, looked down at them
From watchtowers up on the wall
Ken couldn't really hate them, at all
They were just doing their job
And he wasn't gonna make any problems
He had a little garden
Vegetables and fruits that he gave to the troops
In a basket his wife made
But in the back of his mind, he wanted his family's life saved
Prisoners of war in their own damn country, what for?
And time passed in the prison town
He wondered if he'd live it down
If and when they were free
The only way out was joining the Army, and supposedly
Some men went out for the army, signed on
And ended up flying to Japan with a bomb
That fifteen kiloton blast
Put an end to the war pretty fast
Two cities were blown to bits
The end of the war came quick
And Ken got out, big hopes of a normal life
With his kids and his wife, but
Then they got back to their home
And what they saw made him feel so alone
These people had trashed every room
Smashed in the windows and bashed in the doors
Written on the walls and the floor
"Japs not welcome, anymore!"
And Kenji dropped both of his bags at his sides
And just stood outside
He looked at his wife without words to say
She looked back at him, wiping tears away
And said, "Someday, we'll be okay, someday"
Now, the names have been changed, but the story is true
My family was locked up, back in '42
My family was there, where it was dark and damp
And they called it an internment camp
 "When we first got back from camp, uh
It was pretty, pretty bad."
 "I-I remember, my husband said
"Oh we're gonna stay 'til last."
Then my husband died, before they closed the camp."17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I guess that this is where we've come to
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me
But I won't be there when you go down
Just so you know now, you're on your own now, believe me

I don't wanna be the one to blame
You like fun and games? Keep playing 'em
I'm just saying, think back then, we was like one and the same
On the right track, but I was on the wrong train
Just like that, now you gotta face the pain
And the devil's got a fresh new place to play
And in your brain, like a maze you can never escape the rain
Every damn day is the same shade of grey

Hey, I use to have a little bit of plan
Use to have a concept of where I stand
But that concept slipped right out of my hand
Now, I don't really even know who I am
Yo, what do I have to say?
Maybe I should do what I have to do to break free
And whatever happens to you, we'll see
But it's not gonna happen with me
I guess that this is where we've come to
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me
But I won't be there when you go down
Just so you know now, you're on your own now, believe me

Back then, I thought you were just like me
Somebody who could see all the pain I see
But you proved to me unintentionally
That you would self destruct eventually
Now I'll be thinking like the mistake I made doesn't hurt
But it's not gonna work 'cause it's really much worse
Than I thought, I wished you were something you were not
And now this guilt is really all that I got

You turn your back and walk away in shame
All you got is a memory of pain
Nothing makes sense and you stare at the ground
And hear my voice in your head when no one else is around
So what do I have to say?
Maybe I should do what I have to do to break free
And whatever happens to you, we'll see
But it's not gonna happen with me
I guess that this is where we've come to
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me
But I won't be there when you go down
Just so you know now, you're on your own now, believe me
I guess that this is where we've come to
If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me
But I won't be there when you go down
Just so you know now, you're on your own now, believe me

(I'll do what I have to do)
You're on your own now, believe me
(Whatever happens to you)
You're on your own now, believe me
(What do I have to say?)
You're on your own now, believe me
(Is not gonna happen with me)
You're on your own now, believe me17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Someone, right now, is leaving their apartment
Looking down at the street and wondering where their car went
Someone in the car, sitting at a signal
In front of a restaurant, staring through the window
At someone, right now, with their finger in their teeth
Who could use a little floss, right across the street
There's somebody on the curb who really needs a jacket
Spent half the rent, at a bar getting plastered
Now, he's gotta walk fourteen blocks
Just to work at a shop where he's about to get fired
Someone, right now, is looking pretty tired
Staring at a laptop, trying to get inspired
Somebody living right across the street
Just wrote the best thing that she's written all week
But her best friend's coughing up blood in the sink
He can't even think what happened, feeling so confused
That he knows it looks bad, but there's nothing he could do
I wonder what's it like being right there in his shoes, but...

Yo, I'm just taking it in
Out the window of a hotel bedroom, again
Tomorrow, I'll be gone, I don't know when I'll be back
But in this world, everything can change just like that
Yo, somebody, right now, is dropping his vote
Inside a box and trying not to get shot in his throat
For the act of freedom, right now, somebody stuck in Iraq
Hoping that he gets shipped back breathing
In a war where he's not really sure of the reasons
So, we show our support when the press mislead him
Though we mourn, remain proud and salute the troops
Get some, I know you boys got some work to do

Meanwhile, right now someone's twenty-five to life
And standing on the corner with their thumb up, hitch hike
And scratching of a lotto ticket, hoping for a real winner
Sneaking through the border just to work and eat a real dinner
Right now, someone wishes they were you and I
Instead of second guessing fatal thoughts of quiet suicide
But right now, staring out the window at a fiend
With holes in his arms and holes in his jeans
He pulled out a cigarette and sparked a light
And walked right around the corner, just out of my sight, but..

Yo, I'm just taking it in
From a second story hotel window, again
The TV's on and my bags are packed
But in this world, everything can change just like that
Yo, I'm just taking it in
From a second story hotel window, again
The TV's on and my bags are packed
But in this world, everything can change just like that
Right now, somebody's sitting in the darkness
Trying to figure how to put some heat in their apartment
But they got a little mattress, a little carpet
And they appreciate it 'cause some people on a park bench
You see them when you rushing to get to the office
Wife fly by when she coming home from the market
Right now, somebody's coming out the pocket
Trying to dump that rock, they run around the block with
Same time, the cops is raising their Glock's
With aim to fill your legs and your back with some hot shit
Right now, somebody's struggling to stop this man
Who's kicking and punching and cussing at the doctors
Down the hall, the child taking his first breath
The doctors ain't even passed him to the nurse yet
Yo, I wonder if he understand what it's worth yet
Like time spent, while we're on the earth, yeah
The answer to the question we all seek
Can be found, it depends on how free ya'll think
Right now, it's somebody who ain't eat all week
That would kill for the shit you throw away in the street
I guess one man's trash is the next man's treasure
One man's pain is the next man's pleasure
One say infinity, the next say forever
Right now, err'body gotta get it together, man
Uh, I'm just taking it in
In an another strange hotel lobby, again
Put my luggage on my back, I don't know where I'm at
I'm in a world where it all changes, just like that
Yeah, I'm just taking it in
Out the window of a hotel bedroom, again
Tomorrow, I'll be gone, I don't know when I'll be back
But in this world, everything can change just like that6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Let's go, ya'll

These people are running off at the mouth
Trying to convince me that I'm running on empty
Trying to convince themselves
That the record with Jay was a fluke
That the record that I'm making is a mistake
And I can't take this
Let me tell you where I'm at with this
You bastards are gonna have to take back that shit
I'm not plastic and fake
When I make tracks, I take facts and lay them out for the masses
You assholes are gonna see soon that I'm not playing
Start asking me the names that I'm not saying
But I'm trying to be bigger than the bickering
Bigger than the petty name calling, under-the-breath talking
Rumors and labels and categorization
I'm like a struggling doctor, no patients
But you can say what you want about me
Keep talking while I'm walking away (Bitches)

You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up, anyway
I'm taking the high road going above you
This is the last time that I'm gonna trust you
You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up anyway
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot
But it's not gonna work, today
You people are running off at the mouth
Trying to make me take myself off safety
Trying to make my friends turn their backs
On the team we built
Building up some mistaken information
And I can't take this
Let me spell it out plain for you
Angry groups complain about the things we do
I'm not changing direction, I'm stepping my game up
Maintaining my name, the same way I came up
You're gonna see that I'm not playing And Start asking me the names that I'm not saying
But I'm trying not to mention the names of people
Who wanna siphon attention, you like the hype
But pretending you're part of the picture won't pass
You're like a high school dropout, no class
You can say what you want about me
Keep talking while I'm walking away (Bitch)

You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up, anyway
I'm taking the high road going above you
This is the last time that I'm gonna trust you
You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up anyway
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot
But it's not gonna work, today
Why does it always have to be
Somebody's always watching me
All I really need is some room to breathe, breathe, breathe
Is anybody out there, listening?
'Cause I can't stand to keep this in
All I really want, I'll say it again, yeah, yeah
(Like that)

You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up, anyway
I'm taking the high road going above you
This is the last time that I'm gonna trust you
You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up anyway
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot
But it's not gonna work, today11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You know me, I used to get caught up in everyday life
Tryna make it through my day so I could sleep at night
Tryna figure out my way through the maze of rights and wrongs
But like you used to say, nothing feels like it's really worth it
Forget perfect, I'm trying not to be worthless
Since I last saw you, I've been looking for a purpose
Well, I met this kid who thought like I did
He had a weird way of looking at it, this is what he said

"Slip out the back before they know you were there
And at the worst, you'll see nobody cares
'Cause you don't wanna be around when it all goes down
Even heroes know when to be scared
Slip out the back before they know you were there
And at the worst, you'll see nobody cares
'Cause you don't wanna be around when it all goes down
Even heroes know when to be scared"

Now, I don't remember where I met him or remember his name
But he walked funny, like he was just too big for his frame
Just over five foot, but he weighed a buck fifty
And what he said just seemed so right, it stuck with me
Listen, it's like poker, you can play your best
But you got to know when to fold your cards and take a rest
And know when to hold your cards and hold your breath
And hope that nobody else is stacking the deck, because
I don't need to tell you that life isn't fair
It doesn't care, it arbitrarily cuts off your air
And like you, I want someone to say it's okay
But in the truest parts of our hearts, everybody's afraid
We're just under appreciated and overwhelmed
Fighting so hard to hide our fear that we're scaring ourselves
You understand what I'm saying, 'cause you always did
But it's different in the words of a cowardly kid who said
"Slip out the back before they know you were there
And at the worst, you'll see nobody cares
'Cause you don't wanna be around when it all goes down
Even heroes know when to be scared
Slip out the back, before they know you were there
At the worst, you'll see nobody cares
'Cause you don't wanna be around when it all goes down
Even heroes know when to be scared"

And I'm no hero, you remember how I was, you know
All I ever did was worry, feeling out of control
To the point where everything was going end over end
I'm spinning around in circles, again, this is where you come in
All of this to explain to you why
I had to separate myself away from yesterday's life
Please remember, this isn't how I hoped it would be
But I had to protect you from me

That's why I slipped out the back before you knew I was there
I know you felt unprepared
But every single time I was around, I'd just bring you down
And I could tell that it was time to be scared
That's why I slipped out the back before you knew I was there
And I know the way I left wasn't fair
I didn't want to be around just to bring you down
I'm not a hero, but don't think I didn't care8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I had a friend named Victor
The two of us used to hang every single day
And it seemed like overnight that his whole life just changed
I know when his mom and dad broke up, it didn't make sense
But I know that his dad was a drunk and he gambled away the rent
Pretty soon, Vic was seeing red, pissed off, but instead
He'd drink every night 'til he passed out, then he'd do it all again
The whole time, smiling on the outside to cover the pain
But on the inside, all he was trying to do was get away

He's dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday go
Slipping through the cracks

Yo, funny how things change color
Then fade to another shade
When you had it made
It was all good, but now look, just another day
It was so fresh, it was so clean
Now it's all gone, one, two, three, lights out
Which way to turn, can't get a grip
All alone in a big white house
Every day gets worse
And you just curse 'til your head bursts
And it hurts so bad, she left, now you suffer
Should've thought of that one first
No family, no kids, can't accept what you did
Now you wanna run away but you can't
'Cause the past comes back again
Slipping through the cracks, sip a little Jack
Go to bed half dead, what about rent?
Why does every cent gotta be a bet?
When's it gonna end?
Oh my god, we don't got a penny left
My mom's gotta find a way to get a job
Out of debt, out of dodge
Out of breath, out of this big problem
My pops wanna get away from the pain
In a better place in his brain
But the medication he takes makes him wasted
So sick, if he's gonna think
That the good lord would come take him
I'm shaking him, "Wake up, you son of a bitch!"

He's dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday go slipping through the cracks
Hiding himself away
Watching all the memories fade away from red to black
He's dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday go slipping through the cracks
Hiding himself away
Watching all the memories fade away from red to black
Slipping through the cracks
Slipping through the cracks
Slipping through the cracks4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah, go ahead and, uh, cue the special effects

Man, I love this rap game, mainly 'cause it's cool
To add a little spice to the life you've been through
Everyone exaggerates a tiny little bit
Make that shit sound more gangsta than it really is
You can't appear weak, man, we wanna hear street
We wanna hear you spit your thug over this here beat
Don't take it as sarcastic, I can't get enough
I'm telling you, you can call my bluff, if it's not rough
Then, I really don't need it, I'm not even ashamed
I got too much reality that's filling up my brain
So sell me on that product, I'm addicted to the game
Suck it up like a cigarette, light it up, man

It's just like a cigarette, it's something that I do
Once in a while, but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth, I wanna feel fucking cool

Let me tell you something that I realized tonight
My hip-hop radio's like Marlboro light
They both selling stories and they sound about the same
Cigarettes say they safe, rappers claim they really bang
We don't care if it's true when we just lay the money down
We don't believe the words, we just love the way they sound
They're acting like we're idiots, they're lying to our face
Maybe we are idiots, we buy it anyway
I'm running out to get the next rapper's CD
Just sucking up the guns, drugs, and misogyny
The same way that I suck up all the stories when I breathe
That little bit of death, supposedly cancer free
And everything they say's got the truth twisted up
And twisted up's what I want, man, I can't get enough
'Cause even though we know it's all just a big bluff
We just light another up, what, we don't give a fuck!

It's just like a cigarette, it's something that I do
Once in a while, but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth, I wanna feel fucking cool
It's just like a cigarette, it's something that I do
Over and over, but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth, I wanna feel fucking cool
Man, listen to my words, listen for a while
Lip service radio, don't touch the dial
If you're in the car, turn up the track, man
Give your whole neighborhood some second hand rap
Hey, a matter of fact, listen for a while
Lip service radio, don't touch the dial
If your in the car, man, turn up the track
And give the whole neighborhood some second hand rap

It's just like a cigarette, it's something that I do
Once in a while, but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth, I wanna feel fucking cool
It's just like a cigarette, it's something that I do
Over and over, but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth, I wanna feel fucking cool8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everywhere I go, I see another person like me
Trying to make it all feel like home
These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everywhere I go, I see another person like me
Trying to make it all feel like home

Standing on a bridge in the dark and I'm seeing my breath
Trying to make it home without freezing to death
And my Grandfather's face is stuck in my mind
And how seeing him tonight's gonna be the last time
I should've brought a jacket
Blowing in my hands like it's really gonna stop the chill
I buy a cup of coffee with a five dollar bill
Thinking laying in that box, people look so still
At times like these, you start thinking
Your first breath in and the clock starts ticking
I'm not trying to bum anyone out
Not trying to be dramatic, just thinking out loud
I'm just trying to make some sense in my mind
Some defense from the cold that I'm feeling outside
And for a minute, escape with some rhythm and rhyme
And get away from the grey just a bit at a time
Yeah, kind of funny how this world can treat you
Like a freak in a sideshow, a carnival creature
Climbing out of cans, I'm a diamond in the sand
But you can't tell the difference on a beach full of rhinestones
My life's like trying to swallow a pine cone
It's tough when you live fast just to die slow
Talk to dial tones, my dreams are far fetched
It seems, so I sleep underneath this park bench
I know it don't make sense
And I don't expect for you to know what it's like
Smoke, drink, piss, sniffing everything in my sight
Push rocks in a pipe
Lift off, I'll keep puffing 'til my lips turn white
And my chest gets tight, but who the fuck really cares
When you're so far left that even death looks right
All I can do is hope for the best and pray
That it gets a little better than yesterday
These

These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everywhere I go, I see another person like me
Trying to make it all feel like home
These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everywhere I go, I see another person like me
Trying to make it all feel like home
Yo, pardon me, I think I'm next to hurl
Too many problems going on, that's why I left my girl
Packed my backs and I travel with a pen and my notepad
They said I was broken, all the things that I don't have
But still, I try to find a way to escape
From all the hate planted in my head which lead to mistakes
But now I'm breaking the mold, see I was patient and calm
Many sleep in the rain, but now I'm awake in the storm
Writin' my life in the short film, the rise and the fall
How I managed to scorch hills and climb the wall
Pound pavement, aimless in this cold existence
Even though things are changing, I'm going the distance
Overcoming the doubt that had control for so long
To put it all behind me 'cause life still goes on
Now I'm much stronger and know where I stand
While lost souls search over and over again

These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they lost their soul
And everybody's trying not to cry
Trying to get by and trying not to feel outta control
And if you look hard enough, sometimes you'll find
A place that might just remind you of home
But if it doesn't feel like home, you can do what I do
Just pretend you don't feel so alone
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like home
Feel like homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The dude, he said that, like
When we were making the first Linkin Park record
He was like:
"Yeah you know, I don't know about the rapping like, I don't know... If it's like..
Maybe you should just be a rock band."
You know what I mean, like, trying to change us
Like they signed us as an act like what we sound like
And then he's like:
"Oh I don't know maybe you should just play keyboard"

Before the first song that you heard me on
There were people already tryin' to get me gone
Tellin' me to quit rapping, "Just play the keys"
That my band had a singer, they didn't need me
But my band had my back so we did the tracks
Put out the album and the talk went flat
It was funny at first but then the humor faded
When some magazines printed that our label made us
We were to be good to be true
Some were saying ghost writers were writing all that we do
So we had to disprove it:
We spelled it out to the detail how we do it when we're making this music
After that I made it a rule:
I only do E-mail responses to print interviews
Because these people love to put a twist to your words
To infer that you said something fucking absurd
Oh, did I lose you at "infer"?
Not used to hearing a verse that uses over first-grade vocabulary words?
People used to "infer" that we were manufactured
Now I've got the interviews on file
Which people said what, which number to dial
So now every enemy screaming insanity
All they're ever gonna be's another big fan of me
Bitch
Can you believe that?
Like it's crazy, it sounds crazy right?
Like at this point, at this point you're thinking, you hear it out and you're like
"That guy was out of his mind"
But honestly that's what he wrote
Besides the fact that he wanted me to just play keyboard or whatever
He didn't want me to rap
He was like "Maybe Joe Hahn should, um
Wear a lab coat and a cowboy hat" on st–, like when we play
I swear to God he was crazy
And later on he claimed he wrote all our songs so that was really bad."5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Uh, MS, Lupe
You know I'm a fan man, I'm a real fan

(Gonna be somebody)
Feel real honoured to be up in here
(Gonna be someone)
You know what I'm saying?
They had to bring out the expensive mics for this one
(Gonna be somebody)
You know what I'm saying?
The seven thousand dollar headphones for this one here
(Gonna be someone)
Know what I'm saying?
Come on, talk to me

This is the story of them against us, win or lose
Forcing your feet into someone else's shoes
Everybody's got something to say
That we ought to live their way, what we're doing's not okay
In this world, everybody's got a chip on both sides of their neck
Got no respect, wait up a sec
You ever feel like the pressure's too much to take?
Too much weight? Ladies and gentlemen
If anybody can hear me right now, please shout back
We're not the only ones feeling so trapped
In a dream of somebody else, in fact
They got their heads full of some overblown scheme
Opportunity they missed back when they were sixteen
And all they want to do is push you to be that
And all you want to do is scream back
Gonna be somebody
(For anybody telling me I can't)
Gonna be someone
(For anyone who told me I had no chance)
Gonna be somebody
(I'm telling you, the time has come, like that)
Gonna be someone
(And maybe you'll get it when I'm finally done)

We don't sleep to dream, we sleep to build stamina
Energy to do our thing, get your camera
'Cause this ride is about to begin
Sit down and buckle it in, let me say it again
In this world, everybody's got a chip on
Both sides of the neck, got no respect
Wait up a sec, when I was young
They said the odds of making it were slim to none
Ladies and, fuck it
I'm tired of them saying the dream you have doesn't exist
Telling you you're worthless, saying you should quit
Basically, telling you that you'll never be shit
Really, they're pissed 'cause they'll never achieve
Some opportunity they missed back when they were sixteen
And all they want to do is push you to be that
And all you want to do is scream back
Ugh, they gon' think you're crazy mumbling to yourself
In the basement all day, uh-uh-uh'in to yourself
My pops didn't dig it, was shoveling to myself
My boys used to get it, they dug it because they felt
My undertaking took me, I was making in my stealth
A wealth of rhymes of crazy, I would chuckle to myself (Ha)
Then they went into the mental Rolodex
See I'm know 'em by heart, like a brain in my chest
Then I took them to school where subjects was gettin' felt (Ugh)
Books under my seat, notebook laying on my desk
My teacher's like, "Mr. Jaco?" "Yes?"
"With all that knowledge, you ain't tryna go to college?
Be a lawyer or a doctor, get a whole lot of dollars?
Rather degrade women and glorify violence?"
"Well, the work that works for me might not work for you
No homework, I got work to do"

Gonna be somebody
(For anybody telling me I can't)
Gonna be someone
(For anyone who told me I had no chance)
Gonna be somebody
(I'm telling you, the time has come, like that)
Gonna be someone
(And maybe you'll get it when I'm finally done)
And I'm finally done, yeah
This one goes out to those fantastic human beings
That keep us down and hold us back
And give us fuel for what we do

Uh, spray paint and ink pens
I use to write in every color I think in
To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in
Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I
Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, we have a special guest for you this evening
Ghost, you ready?

Yo, I verbally paint pictures, I'm the hood's best storyteller
This about a young boy dealin' with the older fellas
Promised him the lives he seen on TV
He ran packs across town like rhyme CDs
And big chains, new clothes, Nikes and Reeboks
Stackin' too much loot to squeeze in a shoe box
Saving, he promised his Mom a crib in Atlanta
And his pops got killed through debt, he was a dealer
So he staged jazz, fox jump off the suit cases
No more cross-town, now he's crossin' them states and
Seeing new faces, not knowing who to trust
So when the door kicked open they screamed, "This is a bust"
"Is it a set up?" it seemed funny, a scuffle broke out
He got hit, dropped the cases spittin' blood out of his mouth
He walked four blocks to die, trying to survive
And now all that's left is his mom screamin', "God why?"
Uh, spray paint and ink pens
I use to write in every color I think in
To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in
Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I
Yeah, yeah

Let me begin by sayin'...
Shut the fuck up!
Let my begin by sayin' I don't think this man knew what he had in store
He opened the door and found the bag under the floor
Not a peep while he's workin' the lock
Get the flame, aim, pop open the box and take off
Out the back of the pawn shop
Scoping the lot, hoping the cops hadn't seen the plates on his car
He felt like he been hustling so hard
Like a demon he pumped a cold heart
Play it cool like Humphrey Bogart
Put the rings on his chain attached by both parts
He did the drop, one ring in a bag
Envelope, all the money he had
Left the money and the ring in a slow exhale
Two weeks went by, got a box in the mail
In the box was a bullet made of gold
Melted down from the ring, recast with two rings and a band
And he stared at it, sitting in the palm of his hand
And sat down next to a picture that sat on the nightstand
It was his wife in the picture on his side
With the ring on the finger on the week that she died
As he looked in the reflection at those eyes so red
He put the bullet in a gun and put it right in his head
Like that
Uh, spray paint and ink pens
I use to write in every color I think in
To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in
Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I
Yeah
Yeh
Fiasco!
He knew that he didn't have enough power in his thrusters
To muster warp 5
Plus if he pushed it the fuel cells could rupture
Then they would die
Then the galaxy would suffer but he knew he had to try
But he couldn't risk it
Put the cure in the escape pod and kissed it
And told her goodbye
She started to cry
But he knew if he could distract 'em, he could buy her some time
And she could make it out alive
Turn the suit around and got prepared for the stand off
Space mine had blew one of the hands off
Damaged laser cannons and he got the system jammed
And he faced the whole fleet, blood seeping through his teeth
The final saga in the Seven Planet Wars
Unsheethed the sword and then he charged forward
His eyes flashed behind the cracked cockpit glass
He let out a laugh and then all she heard was a blast like...
Uh, spray paint and ink pens
I use to write in every color I think in
To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in
Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I
Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, this has been a Fort Minor production
Ghostface! Fiasco!
Uh, spraypaint and ink pens4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

That beat is hard

This is how it goes, welcome one and all to the show
We're wired up, fired up, fucking ready to go
In the back of the parking lot, outside of the bar
Twenty deep, twenty feet from the boulevard
Black hoodies, black caps, black label in glasses
Previewing the new shit before the masses
'Cause the first thing I need when I've got a new beat
Is to see how it sounds, echoing off the street
I just take it for a spin, pop the CD in
Slide it up to ten and get that rear view shaking
Then play it again so there's no mistaking
San Andreas the block, get this bitch earthquaking, like oh

Oh, ready for it, here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go oh

You're not ready
I got plenty cuts for twenty months dropped steadily
Plenty tracks to empty on your wack pedigree
I'm backed heavily, while you're back-pedalling
Forget the chitchat on me, homie kick back
I'm on that shit that can get your homie bitch-slapped
So zip your lip back, listen and watch
We got the whole block rocking off the way the beat knocks
You don't have to warn the people on the corner they know
That if you're standing on that corner then you're getting that show
World premiering, you're hearing that Machine Shop flow
San Andreas the block, get this bitch earthquaking, like oh
Oh, ready for it, here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go
Oh, ready for it, here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go

Turn the key, turn the volume up to loud
Roll right, roll every window down
Let the whole block know what this is about
Turn it up y'all, burn that system out
Turn the key, turn the volume up to loud
Roll right, roll every window down
Let the whole block know what this is about
Turn it up y'all, burn that system like

Oh, ready for it, here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go oh
Oh, ready for it, here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control, letting everybody know
And if you feel it, let me hear everybody go oh
Let's go out and test out the speakers

Come with me
Let me walk you through the world that I currently stay in
You can take a look around and tell me if I'm mistaken
You can meet and talk to everybody that I live with
Maybe you can tell me why everybody's so distant
Is it me or maybe, when I look around daily
I don't even know the people I can put my trust in, lately
People that I used to hang with, now they're acting so different
I'm still the same person, why doesn't anybody listen?

Can somebody, please just explain to me
What happened to the way that we always said we'd be?
Right now, I don't know why I pushed
Through the pain that I got through, and I'm losing hope

Deafening voices, that frequency inside my head that says
"I'm going at it the hard way"
I focus, get everything inside out of my brain that claims
"I'm going at it the hard way"

Come with me
Let me walk you through the world that I currently live in
Not a thing is forgotten, not a thing is forgiven
Nobody can hold their own underneath the weight, but
Nobody can take the blame for their own mistakes, so
What do you do when somebody lets you down?
And you wanna say something
But you can't, 'cause they're not around
Inside, you think they know the extent of the pain
But they won't even admit that they were the one to blame

Can somebody, please just explain to me
What happened to the way that we always said we'd be?
'Cause right now, I don't know why I pushed
Through the pain that I got through, and I'm losing hope

Deafening voices, that frequency inside my head that says
"I'm going at it the hard way"
I focus, get everything inside out of my brain that claims
"I'm going at it the hard way"

Voices, voices
In my head, in my head

Can somebody, please just explain to me
What happened to the way that we always said we'd be?
Right now, I don't know why I pushed
Through the pain that I got through
And I'm losing hope, give me one reason not to
Voices, that frequency inside my head that says
"I'm going at it the hard way"
I focus, get everything inside out of my brain that claims
"I'm going at it the hard way"3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Uhh, yeah, yo
We 'bout to take y'all to the tip, to the crib
Let's do it Mike (yeah)

Back home (back home) everybody's searching for
Something but all they can find's a whole lot of nothing
Back home (back home) ain't nobody hopin' and prayin'
Cause they feel like nothin' can save 'em
And they try to hold out but they can't fight the fact
That life goes black when those lights go out
But I guess you gotta just watch out for your own cause ain't
A damn thing free back home (back home)

Back home, they holla "disciple" and "blackstone"
Same block they freebase, yo we trapped on
Where our grandmothers marched, the guns clap on
There's liquor stores, beauty supplies and rap songs
I travel the world just to come back to it
The crib got a lot of soul like black music
I'm attached to it, in many ways this city raised me
And gave me the drama, honor and bravery
The streets seem hollow, when I go to Chicago
It's cheap wine and sorrow, times is hard to swallow
In search of God's tomorrow, I borrow words from the
Bible and use them for survival. Gangs
Rival, signs painted on walls like hiero-
-Glyphics, I tell them that this is all tribal
Used to do dirt, shorty's goin' through the same cycle
And trials like Michael, tryin not to stay idle - back home
Back home (back home) everybody's searching for
Something but all they can find's a whole lot of nothing
Back home (back home) ain't nobody hopin' and prayin'
Cause they feel like nothin' can save 'em
And they try to hold out but they can't fight the fact
That life goes black when those lights go out
But I guess you gotta just watch out for your own cause ain't
A damn thing free back home (back home)

Back home, it's not Compton but close, the same problems
Exist and the pain throbbin' and folks are so common
It don't really bother us much, we just swallow it
Uh, crack the bottle and smoke. Hope tomorrow somethin'
Magical happens that'll put me back in the biz
But the chances of it actually happening's kinda slim
Back home, we get the good life at a glimpse
In the form of a rap star, drug dealers and pimps
I'm back, home

Back, home - I try my best to keep it together, it's cold (cold)
Like the Windy City streets of December
I pace back and forth, lookin' for the courage to shine but can't
Tap the source, need somethin' to nourish my mind. I know
We all lose quite a bit in life, only to gain some
Life or the dark winding roads we came from
But I move with the night so I'm used to the shade and never
Lose sight, bringin' truth back to the game
Back, home - we've got a lot of shit on our minds. We're always
Behind on somethin' cause there's not enough time and we're
Non-stop, bottom line, doin' what we gotta do
To get some food in the fridge and stay out of the hospital
Back home there's people callin' us hopeless
People tryin' to tell us all we need is some focus
But, focus, focus is overrated
Cause you see every blemish and mistake and can't change it
Back home is Alvarado, K-Town and
J-Town or Little Tokyo for those that don't know
Where figures shiver, livin' right in the litter
Where kids write bigger, right inside the L.A. river on the
Concrete, a symbol of our everyday way. It's that
Color and concentration over heavy and gray
And by the time the ink dries on this page
I'll be half a day away from the place where I stay (yeah)

Back home (back home) everybody's searching for
Something but all they can find's a whole lot of nothing
Back home (back home) ain't nobody hopin' and prayin'
Cause they feel like nothin' can save 'em
And they try to hold out but they can't fight the fact
That life goes black when those lights go out
But I guess you gotta just watch out for your own cause ain't
A damn thing free back home (back home)
We takin it back home y'all
Yeah, it's Common Sense (yeah)
My guy Mike (what up Com'?)
S.O.B. (uh-huh) yeah
This time we rotate, it's good music (ha ha ha)
Hip-Hop (it don't stop) yeah, uhh
It's home for me baby, yeah3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(Ready? Let's Go!)
(One time)
For my Machine Shop crew and then it's
(Two times)
S.O.B and LP too and then it's
(Three times)
It's Mike and Six on the track and then
(Four times)
When we come in through the back they're saying

Oh no, close the door
Shut the lights and start the show
Better let everybody know
Get on the mic and there they go
Oh no, close the door
Shut the lights and start the show
Better let everybody know
Get on the mic and there they go

Armed and dangerous bitch
Ya'll can't really hang with us in this
Everyone's so afraid of us, shit
Makes me wanna hang it up and quit
Forget about all the things you heard before
'Bout time that we're kicking down your door
Everybody's gonna hit the fucking floor
Like "please Mike don't hurt me anymore"
I dont gotta have a secret lie or an alibi
Everybody knows why I'm here
I'd just as soon crack a bottle
As crack you over the head with a bottle of beer
So just listen up there, powder puff
Better believe that I'm not playing
You can love it, you can hate
But don't mistake it, everybody's saying
Oh no, close the door
Shut the lights and start the show
Better let everybody know
Get on the mic and there they go
Oh no, close the door
Shut the lights and start the show
Better let everybody know
Get on the mic and there they go

What you really wanna do is this:
Just make believe that I don't exist
But you won't, cause every time you go to spit
I talk right over you just like this
It's annoying just for you
You can scream all day 'til your face is blue
I'm getting in your head and you know it too
And that's just me, you don't know my crew
My man Sixx John, understand though
The way that he flows you can call him Rambo
Never miss a shot, never run out of ammo
Coming with heat like a goddamn commando
And add in S.O.B
Ryu, Tak, Vin Skully, Cheapshot
Now you see
Fuck with me? Nah, Sixx!
Oh no, oh no

Uh oh, whatever you yell when you see that door close
I'mma bail through the back (for show)
Straight to the bar so I can act (a fool)
I figure you guys would get a little surprised
Your eyes wide when its me and Mike Shinod
I'm just plain old Sixx John from the Nam-District
This is not supposed
I still talk with awkward speech
I'm like a dog that's off his leash
Step out with a Fort Minor patch on a black tee
Niggas scared to walk these streets
I ain't trippin' homie, talk is cheap
Accapella or we can bark on a beat
And if that ain't enough action I got
Seventeen pages in the little magazine I keep

Oh no, close the door
Shut the lights and start the show
Better let everybody know
Get on the mic and there they go

Yo. You ready do this? (Get up)
Okay (Get up)
Haha! (Get up)
Come on! (Get up)
Let's go!
This is an Invasion!
The Evil Genius Green Lantern
Mike Shinoda
Ladies and gentlemen
I would like to welcome you to a Fort Minor event
The countdown has begun
The Rising Tied is almost here
But for now...
Come on, Mike! (Come on, Mike!)

Yo, let's get it going in front of every man, anybody
You gotta be ready, it's heavy when we get it rowdy
We won't apologize or even think of saying sorry
This is the way we rock steady--
Yo, let's get it going in front of every man, anybody
You gotta be ready, it's heavy when we get it rowdy
We won't apologize or even think of saying sorry
This is the way we rock steady over everybody
You probably shocked, probably ready to stop this already
You probably can't hang with the way we attack it so steady
We let it rock the Rover, bang the Benz, shake the Chevy
'Til everybody feels it in the chest, say it with me
This is the time so just follow me
It's already heated to 100 degrees
So get up (get up), get up (get up)
Get up (get up), get up (get up)

Wait a second, you know the program, this is not a slow jam
This is not a love song, unless you love tearing shit down
Take a look around, you're not running this
The bluff in your nothing will hit you like a ton of bricks
Hit you together with pressure you can never stand
The softest leather just a featherweight, never man
We're not your competitors setting you straight
You never compete, forget it, it's already too late, go!

This is the time so just follow me
It's already heated to 100 degrees
So get up (get up), get up (get up)
Get up (get up), get up (get up)
Yo, if you don't see, I'ma make you see this
If you don't roll, I'ma make you believe it
Get up (get up), get up (get up)
Get up (get up), get up (get up)
Shhh, give me a second, I'm collecting my thoughts
And setting plots....
All right, y'all ready or not?
I've listened and watched and waited for an opening spot
And now that I got it, nobody can pay me to stop
I'm sick of that same thing I've been forced to hear
Over and over again, let me make this clear
If anybody pretends that we're nothing to fear
I solemnly swear it's over, you can tell 'em we're here

This is the time so just follow me
It's already heated to 100 degrees
So get up (get up), get up (get up)
Get up (get up), get up (get up)
Yo, if you don't see, I'ma make you see this
If you don't roll, I'ma make you believe it
Get up (get up), get up (get up)
Get up (get up), get up (get up)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
