(Yo Cherie we here)
(5 o'clock in the morning)
(Might be 3 though)
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry(marry)
Gone off the Belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary(scary)
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
I’ll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie
I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do (you know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do (you know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do (you know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do

I said now what it is, what it do, homegirl ain't got a clue
If I get you open all the things that I would do to you
Smack it up, flip it down, weigh it up, break it down
Lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya who’s ya daddy now
Ain't even gotta open your eyes, know what your looking at
And I ain't even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that
Guess it was love at first sight, eye contact
Remember the night we first met, I caught a contact
Now she's my ride or die, it’s us against the world
You know we both hustlin’ so hustlin’ is our world
Said I must've had too much to drink I’m in my G-Mode
So all the ladies repeat after me cause it’s the G-Code
Promise if I get locked, you’ll come and pay my bond
If you hear some niggas plotting on me, you’ll ring the alarm
And everytime you give it to me it’s gon be the bomb
And in these unlucky streets you’re gon’ be my lucky charm
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry(marry)
Gone off the Belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary(scary)
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
I’ll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie
I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do (you know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do (you know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do (you know I do)
(Man, that boy so cold, give him a blanket in here)
I said I do I do I do I do I do
(Yeah)
(yeah)

I D-O, I D-O, I D-O oh oh
I, Vito, promise to treat this game, i-de-al
Honor the code, not bring drama to mama’s peephole
Life’s a bitch but she's the only love that I know -ow -ow
So la-a-dee, after the “I Do’s” lets do Mercedes
Lets tie the knot, lets grab us a pot, lets make a baby
Looking back, I don’t know who threw this bouquet to me
But I walk down this aisle faithfully, cut that cake for me
I, Jay-Z, take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
And til the task force roll
To hug her every corner til I get ash from the cold
Or until I’ve amassed a fortune, too much cash for me to fold(fold)
Fold under pressure I would never, ever, ever, ever(ever)
Your secret’s I treasure, for better or worse
You’ll always be my first love til death do us part
Pull a hearse up, my verse up
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry(marry)
Gone off the Belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary(scary)
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
I’ll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie
I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do (you know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do (you know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do (you know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do
(Yeah)

Nothing's more attractive than a heavy praying woman
To a him when those and them been defecating on me (ughh)
Her would sense the heaven, and him when Andre omen
Baby I’m hell, save me, don’t bail
Crazy I tell you all of this in the middle of a club
Where words tend to get thrown around lightly like like, like-like, love
"Friend," "rock star" and "So and so’s a genius"
So him vow to never utter him do unless him mean it
Her proud like her mother and ooohh momma’s sweet
So you just know that Juicy fruit ain't gon’ fall too far from tree
So if we ever woopty woop
I want all that bleepty bleep
On this nasty carpet Bixby fresh on one knee
Say I do I do I do I do I do
So we can float up outta here in this hot air balloon
Lets put a baby butterfly up in your lil’ cocoon
And maybe 2030 our baby, she’ll be nerdy make the whole club swoon
She'll love books and cook and look just like you
And when she's done being young, she'll dress like you
We'll call her Love 22, she'll tote a 22, the laser version13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Flew 'em back to the States
Parked ninety-two bricks in front of 560 State
Now the Nets a stone throw from where I used to throw bricks
So it's only right I'm still tossin' 'round Knicks, ugh
Probably brought your auntie a couple bags
I probably front your uncle a couple halves
Was in the S-Class, you was just in class
You know I was finna blow like a meth lab

I got my mind on my money, all I need's a bad bitch
That I can run through the city spend this cash with
That I can run through this city spend this cash on
Wake up in the morning, get my smash on
I don't want much baby, egg whites
Keep your stomach and your thighs and your legs right
While I’m out here focused, getting this bread right
But if the head right, Jeezy there every night
Wake up in the morning and I'm still here
Wake up in the morning and I ain’t gone
All I ask, let me just do me
And maybe just me and you can get along
Had them other bitches mad when they seen us
Had them matching rolexes baby, team us
Yeah the earth is our turf, we can share the world
Maybe even go half on a baby girl
Yeah, she said (she said)

Let me be your mind reader, let me read your mind
And when I’m done with the front, hit it from behind
Love and loyalty, never cross the line
Just hit a nigga up when I cross your mind
Show you how to get you on, you won’t be watching mine
Put you up on a G, show you how to shine
And maybe we can kick it when I got the time
Be my backbone, every nigga need a spine
Gotta know you ride with me if I’m right or wrong
Case I wake up in the morning and it’s all gone
Best believe I’ma get it right back
That's the hustler in me, I know you like that
You probably think I’m with a different broad every night
When I think about it, shit man, you’re probably right
The more I think about it, shit, you’re probably wrong
Cause what you didn’t think about is that I'm probably grown
Yeah, she said (she said)

Cause she just can't help her let me go ahead
And do whatever the hell I want

She said she hate how much she need me
Turn around and say she don’t need me
Always talking about she gonna leave me but she don’t
(She never do though, haha)
But maybe this time might be different
Cause she shed so many tears
She’ll remind me all the dumb shit
That I’ve done over the years
But she don’t be tripping in the mornings
I got her legs up by her ears
But as soon as we get done
I swear this is all I hear

Uh, yeah, yeah

I just want a big ol' bag of money when I see my jeweler
Get a hard-on when I'm counting up that mula (what's up?)
Scarface, into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team, the American Dream
First, they said I wouldn't, but I knew that I would make it (I knew it nigga!)
Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it (what's up?)
Scarface vision, living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team, the American Dream

You either good or you great, you either real or you fake
That's why I stay spittin' the real because the real ones relate
Y'all must was raised by some haters, you niggas go ahead and hate
F-F-Four car garage for the 'Rari, that bitch came with the estate
I swear them streets get so tricky, glad I ain't fall for the bait
So focused and I'm determined, can see that shit in my face
You niggas go 'head and face it, lil' bitch, ain't shit 'bout me basic
Hit a lick on them bitches and went and iced out a bracelet
Never let my flaws and my past come get the best of me
Turn a two fifty to a half, I got the recipe
First, my president was black, now my president is wack
I ain't never going broke, what's American in that?
I just want a big ol' bag of money when I see my jeweler (yeah)
Get a hard-on when I'm counting up that mula (ha ha!)
Scarface, into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team, the American Dream
First, they said I wouldn't, but I knew that I would make it (alright)
Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it (alright)
Scarface vision, living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team, the American Dream

Got money to make, blow out the candles then cut up the cake
Then I put it on plate, I'm running the game, you running in place
Still a youngin' at heart, but mentally, bitch I'm a hunnid'-and-eight
Like Pun in the late 90s, my niggas is juggling weight
Running from state to state, gun in the waist for safety
I'm on a paper chase, whatever it takes to make me
A millionaire, silly 'cause how many really get there?
I mean, how many niggas is Jeezy?
Y'all make this shit sound so easy
Breezy, turn on the TV, see these niggas that trap on the CD
Meanwhile, back home, my niggas sell crack at the BP
Hoping one day they can be thee
Niggas is there on the screen
'Cause that's the American Dream
Now here go the thing, listen
Hysterical screams, coming from mothers that buried their kings
Or the unbearable pain of watching 'em walk out with the sheriff in chains
Becoming a number, they no longer care about the name
White folks been getting rich off of cocaine
Through some underhanded methods, I don't got time to explain
Out of fear that I won't reach 'em and since preaching ain't my thing
I just drop a gem or two within a few verses I sing
For all my real niggas trapped inside the game
You know that already
I just want a big ol' bag of money when I see my jeweler
Get a hard-on when I'm counting up that mula (ha ha!)
Scarface, into living life like a king
Every day eating good with my team, the American Dream
First, they said I wouldn't, but I knew that I would make it
Copped my first pie, yeah, I knew that I could bake it
Scarface vision, living life like a king
Every day grinding hard with my team, the American Dream

(Yeah yuh)
These streets made for ballin' (yeah yuh)
Ten toes ain't for fallin' (yeah yuh)
I hear the world callin'
Tell me if ya all in (tell me if ya all in)
Look, look, I gotta eat, I gotta, make money with
I gotta feast, I gotta re-ly on what is known to the travelin' man
Set his own, got my Bible and my rifle in my hand, oh yeah

My little cool ass bitch, she from the Westside

Call it her bed side, I call it her wet side
And every time the bitch cum, she holler, "Westside!"
One Thursday night, met her at Crucial's

Box of Swishers, box of Magnums, running right through it
All we do is smoke and fuck, smoke and fuck
All we do is smoke and fuck, smoke and fuck
All we do is smoke and fuck, smoke and fuck
All we do is smoke and fuck, smoke and fuck

Yeah, you know it's on after the club, no problemo
Got no problem getting it up, I'm all limo
Yeah, like a black-on-black super-stretch
Trying to break that back, we had super-sex
She say all dick is the same, I got her super wet
Told her all pussy's the same, she got it stupid wet
And when I'm on that trick, I'm going superman
And when I'm on that smoke, I'm going super-HAM
Make a quick stop and a run for blunts and gold boys
When you left your strap in the car? The answer's no, boy
In my wife-beater and boxers, left on my damn chain
Before I left, I put her to sleep, don't play no damn games
She know what to do, and she know how to do it
How I get her done every time we do it
Ain't gotta ask, baby, getting right to it
Box of Swishers, box of Magnums, running right through it

Got turned out at the school, she bisexual
Show up with my game face on, ready to kill something
Man, that thing get so wet, you think you spilled something
She said she can be anything if we arrange it
She said, boy, you better get back, it's bout to rain here
She said, Young, since this your pussy, let's put your name here
Baby girl, since this your crib, let's hide some 'caine here
Think about the business side of it, we both can gain here
Yeah bitch, I know this your shit, we both can hang here
I told her, listen here, that's my shit so let me hide that
She said, listen here, that's my dick so let me ride that

Yeah, be the realest shit I never wrote
I ain't write this, by the way, nigga
Some real shit right here, nigga
This'll be the realest shit you ever quote
Let's go

My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home and Daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a play, anybody seen the scale?
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay? Let's go

Today was a good day, hope I have me a great night
I don't know what you fishin' for, but catch you a great white
Me, I see great white, heavy as killer whales
I cannot believe this, who knew it came in bales?
Who knew what came with jail? Who knew what came with prison?
Just 'cause you got opinions, does that make you a politician?
Bush robbed all of us, would that make him a criminal?
And then he cheated in Florida, would that make him a Seminole?
I say, and I quote, "We need a miracle"
And I say a miracle 'cause this shit is hysterical
By my nephews and nieces, I will email Jesus
Tell him forward to Moses and CC Allah
Mr. Soul Survivor, guess that make me a Konvict
Be all you can be, now don't that sound like some dumb shit
When you die over crude oil as black as my nigga Bu
It's really a Desert Storm, that's word to my nigga Clue
Catch me in Las Vegas, A.R., Arizona
Rep for them real niggas, I'm winnin' in California
Winnin' in Tennessee, hands down Atlanta
Landslide Alabama, on my way to Savannah
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home and Daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a play, anybody seen the scale?
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay? Let's go

I said I woke up this mornin', headache this big
Pay all these damn bills, feed all these damn kids
Buy all these school shoes, buy all these school clothes
For some strange reason my son addicted to Polos
Love me some spinach dip, I'm addicted to Houston's
And if them numbers is right I'll take a trip out to Houston
An earthquake out in China, a hurricane in New Orleans
Street Dreams Tour, I showed my ass in New Orleans
Did it for Soulja Slim, brought out B.G. 
It's all love, Bun, I'm forgivin' you, Pimp C
You know how the Pimp be, that nigga gon' speak his mind
If he could speak down from Heaven, he'd tell me stay on my grind
Tell him I'm doin' fine, Obama for mankind
We ready for damn change, so y'all let the man shine
Stuntin' on Martin Luther, feelin' just like a king
Guess this is what he meant when he said that he had a dream
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home and Daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a play, anybody seen the scale?
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay? Let's go (Yeah)

Our history, Black history
No president ever did shit for me
Had to hit the streets, had to flip some kis
So a nigga won't go broke
Then they put us in jail, now a nigga can't go vote
So I spend dough on these hoes strippin'
She ain't a politician, honey's a pole-itician
My president is Black, Rose golden charms
Twenty-two inch rims like Hulk Hogan's arms
When thousands of peoples is riled up to see you
That can arouse your ego, we've got mouths to feed, so
Gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
'Cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
No matter how big you can ever be
For whatever fee or publicity, never lose your integrity
For years there's been some prize horses in this stable
Just two albums in, I'm the realest nigga on this label
Mr. Black President, yo, Obama for real
They gotta put your face on the 5,000 dollar bill
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home and Daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a play, anybody seen the scale?
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay? Let's go

See, I'm sittin' here right now, man

Nigga, I wanna say win, lose or draw

This a hands-off policy
Y'all touch him, we ridin', nigga
Yeah, first Black president, win, lose or draw, nigga
Haha, matter of fact, you know what it is, man?
Shouts out to Jackie Robinson, Booker T. Washington, homie
Oh, you ain't think I knew that shit?

Cash rules everything around me, so what's realer?
About the scrilla, call me a Ghostface Killa (yup)
It's kinda hard to be drug-free
When Georgia Power won't give a nigga lights free
Switched hustles, been killin' em ever since
It pays to tell the truth, dog, it only makes sense

When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club, pimping, doing my thang (ay)
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy

Pop your collar then you swing your chain
All the gangstas in the street, they be doing they thang (ay)

Have a humble nigga thinking about gun play (chea)
Now who the fuck wanna play with guns?
A lot of holes, a lot of blood, dog...the shit ain't fun (nope)
So I suggest you don't play with my chains
I'll send these hollows atchya, let em play with ya brain (that's right)

More than a hustler, I'm the definition of it
Master chef, Lord of the kitchen cupboard
More than a street legend, homie, it's Hova
More than a relief pitcher, I'm the closer
The Mariano of the Mariott
If money talks, the whole world's 'bout to hear me out
See, I'm a hustler's hope, I'm not his pipe dreams
So when they speak of success, I'm what they might mean
Attract money, my worst color is light green
My favorite hue is Jay-Z Blue
Don't follow me, young'un, follow my moves, I'm not a role model
My bad influence got the world drinking gold bottles
When Puff was in that tub spilling Mo'
I was at my video, Cris' on the speedboat
In My Lifetime, nigga, go through your research
St. Thomas, my nigga, that was me first
Chrome-shoe'd the GS, I came feet-first
In the game like a baby born to breech birth
I got the keys if you need work
I can kingpin you a line, a dime at a time
My niggas love it when I talk like this
My corporate people start bugging 'cause I talk like this
The corporate thugs is like "Nah Hov', talk that shit
The dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy Jay-Z!"
See I'ma '80s baby, master of Reaganomics
School of Hard Knocks, every day is college
You ain't did nothing I ain’t did, nigga pay homage
Or pay the doctor, I spray Llamas still
The time'll reveal, you know I'm being honest
Ya ain’t pull my coat yet and I keep my shit in coat check
They say the truth shall come to the light
So everybody grab your shades 'cause your boy that bright
Goodnight!

Fuck these haters, I’d kill them all if I could
Ain't scared of none of y’all, so you know my aim good
Blowing bin Laden in my Porsche 911
Just left Ground Zero, on my way to kush heaven
Can’t slow down, too much evil in my rearview
Sometimes you wanna scream to God, but he can’t hear you
And even if you did, this’ll probably be his answer:
"Fuck you ‘plaining about? It ain’t like you got cancer"
Do it for my niggas on the block that got it worse
First the love, then the hate, that just a trap nigga’s curse
I bet you feel like the whole world hating on you
But what’s the hold up? The whole world waiting on you

(The fame…)
I wake up and feel empty
Shit make you want to squeeze your Glock until it’s empty
I’m already standing on the edge, so don’t tempt me
Fake motherfuckers envy

You mean to tell me from running my big mouth
That I could chill here in this big penthouse?
All elevatored up, black hardwood floors
Just to sit around and feel like it ain’t yours
Your conscience got you feeling like you done something wrong
But the flatscreen saying motherfucker, we on
Pardon me, nigga, do you see this view?
See Ruth’s Chris from here, what the fuck’s wrong with you?
Looking at my Rollie, yeah, it’s almost 7
Bill Gates state of mind with an automatic weapon
You might remember from putting on for the city
Or back when it was on 2, going for the 50
Opened up a few squares, opened up a few tours
Just to show niggas keys open up doors
“Oh, we don’t fuck with Young no more” Why not?
The only thing I can figure, because he on top
(The fame…)
I wake up and feel empty
Shit make you want to squeeze your Glock until it’s empty
I’m already standing on the edge, so don’t tempt me
Fake motherfuckers envy

Lately, I been often out of sight, seldom out of mind
Ay, getcha bidne’ right, and stay the hell up out of mine
I’m out my mind, tryin’ to fix it ‘fore I’m out of time
Don’t worry ’bout me, God got me, bruh, I’m doin’ fine
Another year in prison, promise this is it for me
Tryna make it through the storm, should be makin’ history
No feelin’ sorry for me, keep ya pity and ya sympathy
Good or bad, take it like a man, whatever meant for me
How I did it make ‘em hate my spirit, they wish they could kill it
And they’ll take it however they can get it
Wanna see me fulla misery, walkin’ wit’ my head down
“Let’s decapitate him, then we’ll see if he can wear his crown”

I wake up and feel empty
Shit make you want to squeeze your Glock until it’s empty

Favorite girl, guess she got the skills just to pay the bills
Last nigga she was fucking with was worth a couple mil
Even when she going for the low, says she's not a ho
Yeah you know that thing is super-wet, talking sloppy joe
Said she like it when I whip it fast then I whip it slow
Even though she got a lot of names, I just call her "blow"6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The fuck am I doing?
Wake up in the morning like who the fuck am I screwing?
My partner on brown and you know I'm on white
I know it's going down, I can do this all night
Gotta get to the paper, one time for the haters (Mike WiLL Made-It)
Money over bitches, two times for the fakers
Cause even in the dark, baby I'mma shine bright
I'm way too gone, the best night of my life (EarDrummers)

Look, yeah, I said, "G-g-g-go DJ"
See you got the Jizzle on replay
Just keep that Jizzle on repeat
It's about the time everybody screams "free Meech!"
Let's take your bitch ass back to '05
Close your eyes, take a breath, nigga look, Atlanta lights
Club vision, PJ in my hand, I’m on the couch
Man this nigga Meech just blew a quarter mil, he bought a house
Man you niggas gonna lace up your sneaks, it's time to ball
Presidential at the Swiss Hotel makin' Kamals
Posted up, all black in the back, 100 deep
A hundred coupes posted up in the front, 200 seats
Man somebody call the IRS, too many Lambos
Yeah I'm talking bottles and blunts, all you can handle
Them other niggas fake and flaunting, that's where it's at
Real niggas do real things, let's drink to that
Way too gone, what the fuck am I doing?
Wake up in the morning like who the fuck am I screwing?
My partner on brown and you know I'm on white

I'm way too gone, the best night of my life

Yeah, I said I'm gone, I'm going going gone
Way this night is going, I won't make it home
I'mma wake up in the room, wake up with a hangover
What I spent last night, I could bought a Range Rover
Got my Ray Bans on, yeah I see you haters
Keep doing what you doing cause I need you haters
She said, "What's your cologne?" Said, "You can call it strong"
If I had to name my money baby, I would call it long
I said I'm way too gone, I don't see nobody
I ain't even on the bill, I'm acting like it's my party
It feel like I'm on fire, oh I'm just that high
If I smoke another blunt, yeah I swear I'm gon' die
You can call the weed man, tell him bring another zip
Yeah I know he just left, he gotta make another trip
It's so hot in here, I feel like I'm gon' faint
Even though I'm past my limit, still think I'm gon' drink
Way too gone, what the fuck am I doing?

Cause even in the dark, baby I'mma shine bright
I'm way too gone, the best night of my life

Astronaut nigga!
I woke up early this morning, three white girls from the Pink Pony
I'm blowing money fast, so caught up in the moment
One time for the bar, two times for my homies
I'm a rockstar in real life, I'm an astronaut outta sight
Put codeine in my Sprite, my wrist is full of ice
I don’t even know her name, she so caught in the hype
It's okay baby, cause I'm a millionaire for life
I got bitches on my payroll, they coming back like white
I'm with Ethiopian, we in Vegas shootin' dice
Got a girl at home, I know I'm wrong, it feels so right
On the first roll, Young, I hope I roll a seven
We in the club, for thugs, this must be heaven

Way too gone, what the fuck am I doing?
Wake up in the morning like who the fuck am I screwing
My partner on brown and you know I'm on white
I know it's going down, I can do this all night

What's in the back of my mind, sittin' in the back of that thang
With the two double R sittin' in the back of my brain
Anywhere but here, that's what I told my chauffeur
And this shit gettin' heavy, weight of the world on my shoulders
Think you figured it out, but you don't have a clue
Think you on top of the world but the world on top of you
I started hustlin' for draws and now there's plaques on the walls
Think I'm sellin' my soul? Then you can come get 'em all
Trade 'em all for my dawgs, yea, I'm talkin' to you
Where did we go wrong? Because I don't have a clue
You just wanna hit the mall and buy a new pair of shoes
But it's real consequences nigga remember the rules
So I regret the day you ever serve that nigga
Took 5 years of your life, you didn't deserve that nigga
I guess power and pain look it's somewhat the same
I lost my dawg to the fame, I charge it all to the game

Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
I said we came so far but yet it feel so surreal
Hood nigga, half a mili, automobile
I'm talkin' real luxury, don't feel a bump in the road
We ain't like the rest of these niggas that fall out over hoes
Thought you my nigga forever, thought that you could be trusted
Man I found out you takin' it, really had me disgusted
Nigga, who am I kiddin'? It felt like a heart attack
Cause I gave you my heart and didn't ask for it back
And to be honest with you, I really thought we were brothers
Fuck everybody in this world as long as we have each other
Woulda done anyything, took a trafficking charge
Everyday on my head just to see you livin' large
Gangster pitted it kills, gave you your first mill
And I ain't tell you to blow it, I ain't tell you to throw it
You fell a victim to pressure, yea, I know it can stress ya
But you're only a man, homie, I can't be mad at ya

Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
How can ya see out the windows between your shades and your tint
Sippin' good in the back, I'm like fuck it, I'm bent
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make any sense
They sayin' I owe 'em dollars and that don't make any sense
Almost fell for the bait, almost fell for the hate
And I'm the same nigga that let you niggas eat off my plate
Saw that shit from the door, knew that shit from the go
I guess this how I go, sit back and laugh at the show
Remember back in the day a nigga took your shit
Told you don't put it there and a nigga stole your brick
Didn't I put ya back on, did I handle ya wrong?
When niggas start actin' weak that means it time to be strong
See I kept it so real, I ain't keep it real with myself
I'm gone be real with you niggas, I gotta be real with myself
And I'm gone be real with ya homie, look you don't got me convinced
Is this payback for my sins? I guess I need to repent

Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most
