My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote
Make me your radio (Yeah, ha ha)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (Right there)
Just sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no— (Yeah)
Oh—ote (Yeah, yeah, come on)
Make me your radio (Uh-uh)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh, oh oh-oh, oh
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Just sing along to my stereo
Let's go!

If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (Remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

My heart's a stereo (Yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close (Listen)
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote (Oh, oh)
Make me your radio (Come on)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo (Sing along like)

Oh, oh oh-oh, oh (Yeah)
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Just sing along to my stereo

I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find)
I take your hand and hold it closer to mine (Yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind (Yeah, yeah, come on)
My heart's a stereo (Yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote (Oh, oh, oh)
Make me your radio (Ah-huh)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh, oh oh-oh, oh (Haha)
Yeah, yeah, ye—eh—eh
Oh oh oh-oh (To my stereo) (Let's go)
Yeah, yeah, ye—eh—eh
Oh, oh-oh (It's your boy, Travie)
Yeah, yeah, ye—eh—eh
(Gym Class Heroes, baby) Just sing along to my stereo
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Mbabarara, mbabarara
Mbabarara, mbabarara, mbabarara

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But Momma, I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend
And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin' (Mbabarara)
I mean, she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is
We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun (Mbabarara, mbabarara)
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

It's been a while since we talked last
And I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast
But Dad, I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one
Type of girl that'll make you way proud of your son
And I know you heard the last song
About the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name (Mbabarara)
I love it when she calls my phone
She's even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (Mbabarara)
It's gonna be a long drive home
But I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door, take off my coat, and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back into my arms once more for sure like
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

She's got a smile that'll make the most senile
Annoying old man bite his tongue (I'm not done)
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise
And it doesn't stop there (Man, I swear)
She's got porcelain skin, of course she's a ten
Now she's even got her own song (But movin' on)
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours (Not sayin' one word)
And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future, she's the main component
Call it dumb, call it luck, call it love
Or whatever you call it, but
Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)30EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah
Just waking up in the morning and to be well
Quite honest with ya, I ain't really sleep well
Ya ever feel like your train of thought's been derailed?
That's when you press on, Lee Nails
Half the population's just waitin' to see me fail
Yeah right, you're better off tryna freeze hell
Some of us do it for the females
And others do it for the retails
But I do it for the kids, life threw the towel in on
Every time you fall it's only making your chin strong
And I be in your corner like Mick, baby, til the end
Or when you hear this song from that big lady

Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gonna do y'all?

Give 'em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life til we're dead
Give me scars, give me pain
Then they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
There goes a fighter, there goes a fighter
Here comes a fighter
That's what they'll say to me, say to me
Say to me, this one's a fighter
And if I can last thirty rounds
There's no reason you should ever have your head down
Six foot five, two hundred and twenty pounds
Hailing from rock bottom, Loserville, nothing town
Textbook version of the kid going nowhere fast
And now I'm yelling kiss my ass
It's gonna take a couple right hooks a few left jabs
For you to recognize that you really ain't got it bad

Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gonna do y'all?

Give 'em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life til we're dead
Give me scars, give me pain
Then they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
There goes a fighter, there goes a fighter
Here comes a fighter
That's what they'll say to me, say to me
Say to me, this one's a fighter
Everybody put yo hands up
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do? Ya'll
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do? Ya'll

If you fall pick yourself up off the floor (Get up)
And when your bones can't take no more
Just remember what you're here for
Cause I know I'mma damn sure

Give 'em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life til we're dead
Give me scars, give me pain
Then they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
There goes a fighter, there goes a fighter
Here comes a fighter
That's what they'll say to me, say to me
Say to me, this one's a fighter

Till the referee rings the bell
Till both ya eyes start to swell
Till the crowd goes home
What we gonna do kid?21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh, it's so sexy, yo

I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (Ya)
For one more chance to hold you close
(It's your boy Travie, Gym Class Heroes)
I don't know where you're going (Let's go, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions (No)
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets down right shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke I told you I wouldn't be long
That was last November, now December's almost gone
I'd apologize, but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong
I never know

I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (That's love, yeah)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, okay, what's that?)
Just get your ass back home
And you've been nothing but amazing and I'll never take that for granted
Half of these birds would've flew the coop but you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me every time you heard some bogusness (Tough love)
You deserve a standing O cause they'd have just been over it
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving
'Cause you and I above all that, just let 'em wallow in it
And now they all choked up, yuck, 'cause they be swallowin' it

I don't know where you're going (Yeah)
Or when you're coming home (Alright)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm coming home, mama)
(Mama, I'm coming home)
To our front door (That's love)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

No one holds me down like you do, sweetheart
You keep doing that, I'll keep doing this
And we'll be alright, trust that
We put the "us" in "trust", baby
Ahh, let's go!
I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone

I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Or when you're coming home (Okay)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm home now, baby, let's go)
To our front door (Uh-huh)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going
Just get your ass back home

I'm home, baby9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You know what it is
Gym Class Heroes, The-Dream
It’s hard to look innocent when I got cookie crumbs all over my face

I like girls
They like me
They look so cute in their 7 Jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar
My hands, my hands, my haha... my hands
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

You see I got this problem
I need help trying to solve it
'Cuz meeting after meeting
And I'm still a cookie-holic
You can hide 'em, I'ma find 'em
On the counter, in the closet
And I'll say I ain't do it
With my face covered in chocolate
My girl be setting booby traps
To catch me eating Scooby Snacks
I left crumbs in the bed once
But I told her I was through with that
She still don't be believing me
And I guess that I'm cool with that
But I got a sweet tooth
That'll never come loose
And the truth of the matter is
I like girls
They like me
They look so cute in their 7 Jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar
My hands, my hands, my haha... my hands
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

I got a thing for Milano biscotti Italianos
And I'll never turn down some Oreos if you got them
Butter pecan Puerto Rican
Or them oatmeal raisin Asians
Hazelnut Brazilians, macadamia Caucasians
Double Stuf or Thin Mint
It don't matter, you gettin' it
'Cause I got a sweet tooth
That'll never come loose
And the fact of the matter is
I like girls
They like me
They look so cute in their 7 Jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar
My hands, my hands, my haha... my hands
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

I'm a monster for these cookies
I'm a beast for their treats
I'm an animal for they're crackers
Head to feet, they so damn sweet
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

See, here's the thing

We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no

Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig the attitude and how you're acting like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travie and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you've never heard of me
That sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burglary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some Naked Peek-A-Boo
Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Such an angel with a devilish angle
And quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl
And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too
We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no

Now here's another barn burner for the slow learners
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop, right around the corner from your momma live
No turning back so you better buckle up
Shit, don't be concerned with mine
I feel like a Speak-n-Spell way I got you learning my lines
Fine, pull the string, replay that shit
I change my name to "did he really just say that shit?" (Yep)
I'll take a mile if you let me
Six-five, two hundred plus and so sexy
My legs going numb for keeping my phone on vibrate
To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I've been trying to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up

We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie-rock chicks, and hip-hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie-rock chicks, and hip-hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

Good grief girl, you're giving me goosebumps
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
Honestly I could easily replace you
It's not a scam girl
That's how I am girl
Peter Pan, I'm a sucker for Smucker's jam girl
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun
Shut up and kiss me like the antidotes under my tongue
Whoa

We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no
We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie-rock chicks, and hip-hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie-rock chicks, and hip-hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks

It's every boys dream...)

True story
Somebody asked me one time
"Travie, you high?
You look high"
"Shit, yeah I'm high"
Let's go

The world is yours, so play the role
Blow the dust off this record and put the needle down slow
Our veins are cold, but we'll never grow old
Let's have a toast, and raise our drinks
No hearts on our sleeves, just eagles on our cuff links
It's such a rush to know you love me so much

We'll do whatever you want to
Girl I'll make a movie star of you
You know that I could
If you let me be your Hollywood
We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line
We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line

Take your razor, break down my line
Put your nose to the speaker
Now breathe in, breathe in
Clean up your nose, and face the crowd
Then kiss your mirror 'cause we're all stars now
Isn't it fun how music makes your lips numb?

I took Cutie for a ride in my Death Cab
She tipped me with a kiss, I dropped her off at the Meth Lab
Before she left, she made a Dashboard Confessional
Then spilled her guts in Cursive, but what's worse
Is I could still see her Bright Eyes like Sunny Day Real Estate
Oh my, and the funny way the ceiling tastes x
So high, but no chance
My little Chemical Romance, left a bad taste in my mouth
But I approached her like, Hey Mercedes, why the long face?
Why you cryin, no need, just put on this Coheed, and Fall Out
Boy meets Girl, Jimmy Eat World
But Schlep eats pills 'til he's all out
Not once, not twice, she was Thrice times a lady
Actin all Brand New, but I had to
Bounce to the Postal Services to
Pick up these pills that take care of my nervousness
And, on the way, I saw Planes and Mistook 'em for Stars
She played games, but she took 'em too far
At the Drive-in, watchin' soft porn and you could tell
By the Trail of the Dead that there was something in the popcorn
Hop in my cab, destination Midtown
Just to get up with some kids that like to get down
I made my rounds and that was that
In between the frowns and scraps and heartattacks
And I remember
I seen her ass Early November
On a Thursday, Taking back Sunday for a refund
She shot a wink, like No Hard Feelings
Then she Jetted to Brazil, man, them pills had me spun
Yeah, this The Story of the Year right here
This is Hot Water Music
Cook your Ramens to it
Whattup Elliott I ain't seen you in a minute
How you doin?3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

As the white stallion bucks
And kicks me in my nose until my face bust, fuck
And they say that they can keep the pace up, but its
Clear as a mirror they don't want to race us
As I stare in this mirror and powder my face up
And I never ever been one to make up
Any allegations that alligators ate us
And from the spine I spit shots, you gonna need 8 cups
Game and money, call me Mr. Monopolist
Ms. Aphrodite what is your synopsis
You can be the goddess of my white castle
Reach me on the hotline and burn your nostrils
Professor cool, I bring class to gym
And since I am the hero I must save them
Him is I and I is Wayne
This isn't your brain on drugs; its drugs from the brain
Let's go
The world is yours, so play the role

Our veins are cold, but we'll never grow old

'81 was the year shit hit the fan in a major way
A sad day for aspiring artists
Almost 20 years after the fact I'm still on my hustle
Diggin' graves for an aspiring artists
Pushing daises up
And never compromise the arts to make a crowd clap
Shit on since the first show
But we turned feces to fertilizer
So when you diss it's just food for the flowers to grow
Sold 15 plus out of backpacks, no trunks
Too young to drive
Put live hip hop in the ears of upstate kids
That thought rap was past tense, hence the last name
Got name for playing basements and such and making songs that our friends loved
And when the fish bowl got too small to hold the goldfish
We filled our gills with water and ripped that mother fucker like

So take a step back
And a breath in
Let it out now
Put your chin up
You can do it tiger
You a man now
And in your dream it's time to do the best you can now
We break ourselves down
And build ourselves up in disappointment
How fragile we are
So fragile we are, we just don't show it
We'll shake up this town
And shoot down the stars for our enjoyment
So sexy we are
So sexy we are, we just don't know it

This is what you wanted right?
How many nights were spent pouring out your guts dummy?
How many punishments endured for fucking up in school?
How many teachers proved wrong by writing songs instead?
(My point exactly)
But you knew you had a spark, did you?
Something producin' to the dreams your pop's dreams lent you
Stay focused when nothing seemed to make sense
Stealing verses with that Cassius Clay confidence
Sometimes you stubborn as shit, that's the McCoy in you
You learn to be a man without losing the boy in you
(Just do your thing man)

So take a step back
And a breath in
Let it out now
Put your chin up
You can do it tiger
You a man now
And in your dream it's time to do the best you can now
So take a step back
And a breath in
Let it out now
Put your chin up
You can do it tiger
You a man now
And in your dream it's time to do the best you can now
We break ourselves down
And build ourselves up in disappointment
How fragile we are
So fragile we are, we just don't show it

Ch-Ch-Ch-Children put on your angry faces
Mothers hide your daughters
I've been busy burning bridges
Hovering over troubled waters
City folk will never understand
The country mouse's jokes
They'd rather sit and watch the lemmings
Lead each other to the slaughter
This is me thanking you dearly
Sincerely, from the bottom of what's left of my misery magnet
Guess I been too busy being stagnant
And if I ever steer you wrong
Grab the wheel and jerk it left
I'm only human but admitted
I'm such a beautiful mess

With the mad hatter cackle
And the cheshire cat smile (Haha)
Put the jabberwocks cadaver
With derelict juvenile (Oh)
The futures got Travie engraved
On a name plate that I copped on fulton
While the passers poppin pills
Somewhere on the other side of Brooklyn
So this is me in front of the class naked
This reoccurring nightmare never ending
So I'm saying hello (So I'm saying hello)
And now I'm screaming hello (Now I'm screaming hello)
Is anybody out there?
Now this is me in front of the class naked
This reoccurring nightmare never ending
So I'm saying hello (So I'm saying hello)
And now I'm screaming hello
Can anybody hear me?

Baby let's ride the steel horse
Until it stops galloping
And let the nerds get revenge
On these stars with lamar's javelin
Here betty, put this vader mask on
And take me to the dark side bumpin your favorite song
And I promise i'll stand still
Until the feeling is gone
And if I slip and bust it's
Cause we must be doing it wrong
Oh by the way
If you happen to meet the asshole
That wrote the manual
Tell'em large marge sent me to murk'em and make it casual
With the mad hatter cackle
And the cheshire cat smile (Haha)
Put the jabberwocks cadaver
With derelict juvenile (Oh)

Now this is me in front of the class naked
This reoccurring nightmare never ending
So I'm saying hello (So I'm saying hello)
And now I'm screaming hello
Can anybody hear me?

So I'm leaving the grocery store the other day
Probably one of the hardest things I have to do
In a regular basis, you know
With my anxiety and all
And a women walks up to me (Hey aren't you travie?)
She doesn't say hello
She just grabs me
And I can feel my heart beating harder and harder and harder
(I'm from upstate too) (Uh, cool)
I can feel the skin on my chest getting tighter and tighter
Until I just, until I just
Fucking spontaniously combust
With the mad hatter cackle
And the cheshire cat smile (Haha)
Put the jabberwocks cadaver
With derelict juvenile (Oh)
The futures got Travie engraved
On a name plate that I copped on fulton
While the passers poppin pills
Somewhere on the other side of Brooklyn
So this is me in front of the class naked
This reoccurring nightmare never ending
So I'm saying hello (So I'm saying hello)
And now I'm screaming hello (Now I'm screaming hello)
Is anybody out there?
Now this is me in front of the class naked
This reoccurring nightmare never ending
So I'm saying hello (So I'm saying hello)
And now I'm screaming hello
Can anybody hear me?
Can anybody hear me?

Hi, did you like the music?
I liked it
It was awesome
Hey, my favorite song was the one where the base went
"bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum"
And the guitar went "wee wee wee wee"
And the drums went "drummy drum drum drum drum drum drum drum drum
Do you remember that song?
I liked that
I want more music
Hey, have you ever wondered if a seahorse could win
A game of backgammon against an invisible wizard?
I think the invisible wizard would win
Because the seahorse does not have hands
Hey, have you ever seen an invisible wizard?
Probably not
Because it's invisible
Hey, remember that time when we were on that spaceship
And there were talking dinosaurs
And then one of the dinosaurs said:
"I cannot talk"
And I said: "You just did"
And the dinosaur didn't say anything else because
He couldn't talk?
Hey, are you listening to me?
Remember that stick of broccoli that used
To play the banjo at the annual platypus convention?
He owes me money
Hey, I'm cool
Hey, good nightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Let's go

Oh, when the day is gone
Oh, when the nights are long
Life goes on
Life goes on
We gotta live it up 'til it's gone (Live it up)
'Cause we won't be around too long (Nah)
Life goes on
Life goes on (Yeah!)

Lately, it seems the good dreams are few and far between
Nightmares are putting fires out with gasoline (Damn)
And I'm just tryin' to stay righteous
Sometimes I see my own face in Christ's likeness (Uh-huh, yeah)
And apart from my life's vices
Fifteen years young had my first midlife crisis (Uh, uh, wow)
But it's tough to stay upright and pious
When people you hold highest be the ones that most biased (Damn)
My daddy told me misery loves company
If that's the case they must hate they ain't getting none from me
I don't sweat it, it's embedded in my DNA
I got a good heart and Bad Brains BMA
Oh, when the day is gone (Yeah)
Oh, when the nights are long (Uh-huh)
Life goes on (Life goes on)
Life goes on (They say that life goes on, let's go!)
We gotta live it up 'til it's gone (Live it up)
'Cause we won't be around too long (Nah)
Life goes on (Life goes on)
Life goes on (You know that life goes on)
Yeah (Come on!)

Up late Facebookin', playing could've been
And staring at an empty bed my ex-girl should've been in
Thinking what I woulda done different
Not a damn thing 'cause finally I'm done with it (I'm done)
Besides, I got a girl that adores me
And I never take for granted all things she does for me (Never)
I shoot the moon down and put it on a wedding band (*Pow*)
And sing "These Arms of Mine" to her, she's a Otis Redding fan
And she'll never forget it, man
'Cause she knows she'll never find a better man (No)
Let's go ahead with these wedding plans
Come on, let's sing a song, life goes on

Oh, when the day is gone (Day's gone)
Oh, when the nights are long (Nights are long)
Life goes on (Life goes on)
Life goes on (You know that life goes on, come on!)
We gotta live it up 'til it's gone (Live it up)
'Cause we won't be around too long (Nah)
Life goes on (Life goes on)
Life goes on (They say that life goes on)
Yeah
We take too much for granted
Too much, we don't want an inch, we want miles
I just can't understand it
Can't understand it, is it really that hard to smile?
We don't ask, we demand it
We demand it, it's gone when it's gone
And I'm tryin' not to panic
But you know what they say, life goes on

Oh, when the day is gone (Yeah!)
Oh, when the nights are long
Life goes on (Life goes on)
Life goes on (Ya know that life goes on, come on!)
We gotta live it up 'til it's gone (Live it up)

Oh, when the nights are long (You know that life goes on)
Life goes on (They say that life goes on)
Life goes on (You know that, You know that, you know that life goes on)
We gotta live it up 'til it's gone
'Cause we won't be around too long (So beautiful)
Life goes on (I feel amazing, baby)
Life goes on
(Life goes on)
Yeah! Ha-ha-ha
(Life goes on)
(Life goes on)
I'm feeling motha-fucking great

I knew this kid named Alberto
Funny style cat and his girl looked like a turtle
Not Lisa Turtle, just a turtle
High school track he ran the hurdle
His peers shed tears senior year when he got murdered
Now Alberto was your average A student
Participated in class, never came late and never truant
His family was picture perfect his older sister was prom queen
His dad a decorated vet for the Vietnam team
His mother was Dear Abby, an ordinary house wife
Like clockwork, always had dinner on the table at 5
But Alberto had a monster, he kept under his bed
And instead of lettin' it out, he just got a girlfriend instead
She knew something was funny, she could tell by his behavior
Or the way he flamboyantly shook his hand when he would wave to her
She thought nuttin' of it and just shoved it in the closet
Until the day the word dripped out like leaky faucet
Alberto was homosexual; I ain't have nothin' against it
But little Ronnie Johnson and all his football player friends did
They'd always pick and nag, call him fag and such and such
And couldn't wait to get to gym so they could really bust his nuts
The gym teacher never cared, he'd just join in on the action
He'd make silly gestures and compare him to Micheal Jackson
Alberto couldn't take it he just stopped showin' up
And whenever he walked them halls he just felt like throwin' up
And at night, he would cry and cry and ask "God why?"
Like "God, why in the fuck I had to be born this way?"
God would reply, "Son you gotta show 'em you're more than gay"
(Gotta show 'em you're more than gay..)
See he had dreams to be a track star
Until the warm April night them gay jokes went way too far
Ronnie begged for his forgiveness and invited him to a party
Cause his parents went away and left him plenty of Bacardi
Alberto kindly accepted, he was finally accepted
Except it was all deception and left him all unprotected
It was a plan Ronnie had scammed to get him in the right place
Verbally degrade him and rearrange his pretty face
The plan would go swiftly, they started callin' him sissy
One punch turned into fifty they beat him till he was dizzy
Now Alberto lie in blood while his peers look on in fear
He took his last breath and passed away his senior year
Needless to say it was one big tragedy
And how was Ronnie gonna explain it to his family
While they were on vacation takin' in sights
He got wasted and killed a kid that night
Don't be a slave and behave the way they do
Just utilize the gifts that God gave you
Don't be a slave and behave the way they do
Just utilize the gifts that God gave you
Don't be a slave and behave the way they do
Just utilize the gifts that God gave you
Don't be a slave and behave the way they do
Just utilize the gifts that God gave you

I knew this girl named Maria, bright and talented
With aspirations to be a, big superstar
What a great idea, until she fell off
And started to listenin' to her peers - oh dear!
Now Maria was your typical obnoxious analytical
Headstrong rebel flippin' off the principal
Single mother home structure, she looked after baby brother
While moms worked two jobs just to buy supper
Pops was a strugglin' musician, troubled man
Jugglin' family and heroin addiction
He overdosed and left a notice of eviction
And, a crate of records on the table in the kitchen
And, a little angel with a keen sense of sound
Who saw solace in the records she found
And she would stay up late at night
Recitin' songs to herself under pale moonlight
Rightin' wrongs that her pops made
Promised her mom she would never go that same route, turns out
Carrie Anne had other plans
Her and her man Ronnie most popular, second best to nobody
Homecoming queen versus ugly duckling
And the story ends the same way
Okay Ronnie's parents went away for a couple of days
And told him no drinkin' - what the fuck was they thinkin'?
Maria was oblivious that her boyfriend had already been invited
So when Carrie Anne asked, she got all excited
Like "Damn, now I got somethin' to look forward to"
Or so she thought
Maria kindly accepted, she was finally accepted
Except it was all bullshit, now pay attention
Carrie Anne hated Maria cause she could sing
So she scored a bag of heroin, but the craziest thing
Was Maria never touched drugs, she did that night
And when her man was gettin beat she was nowhere in sight
Now her boyfriend lie in blood and she had no idea
Alberto passed away and she got hooked her senior year
Needless to say it was one big tragedy
And, I hate to break it but it doesn't end happily
A warm day in May, the sky was so beautiful
Carrie Anne died in a crash leavin the funeral1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She says she loves me but, she comes and goes when she pleases
When the door shuts, it's like another papercut
And I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceilin fan blades
Claims she loves me but, she cuts me into pieces
When I'm sewed up, here comes another papercut
Now I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades

We met twenty-two years back, fresh out the womb
Now she consumes me, no room for self these days
And she's so demandin - do this, do that
Don't forget to take your medicine
I hate it when her face is invading my head again
The welcome mat reads "please take off your shoes"
But she disregards the statement
I've grown accustomed to bending my beliefs
To, satisfy her needs but I'm fed up
With plugging cuts everytime they bleed
So I dip my pen in the puddle
What a bloody mess its been tryin to end this struggle
But I love her, she's the reason for the lesions
Man I love her, I start bleeding when she's leavin
And every scar on my fingertip is a reminder of
All the lessons learned on my missions tryin to find her but
I'll sit alone 'til she comes back home
And I'll be waitin by the phone {*ring*} hello?
She says she loves me but, she comes and goes when she pleases
When the door shuts, it's like another papercut
And I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceilin fan blades
Claims she loves me but, she cuts me into pieces
When I'm sewed up, here comes another papercut
Now I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades

She don't live here no more; I heard she's stayin down the street
With a deadbeat that don't treat her right with two bad-ass kids
Guilt and regret, and I'm willin to bet
My last album that she's wishin she was kissin me

Man the nerve of this bitch, pardon my French but it's been 10 days
And I'm gettin kind of lightheaded
Maybe I'll write her a letter, in a gentleman's way
And send it, with the hopes that she might get it
I can't believe I let her run all over me
But, all I think about is when she's here and holdin me
I love her, she's the reason for the lesions
Man I love her, I start bleeding when she's leavin
And every scar on my fingertip is a reminder of
All the lessons learned on my missions tryin to find her and
I can't complain, I kind of like the pain
She ain't even got a name she just lives in my brain and
She says she loves me but, she comes and goes when she pleases
When the door shuts, it's like another papercut
And I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceilin fan blades
Claims she loves me but, she cuts me into pieces
When I'm sewed up, here comes another papercut
Now I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades

Says she loves me but (she really thinks that I'm an asshlole)
She says she loves me but (my ears are too big)
She says she loves me but (I pick my nose too much)
She says she loves me but (she says I never really listen)
She says she loves me but (I take too many pills)
She says she loves me but (I never pay my bills)
She says she loves me but (I wait until the last minute)
She says she loves me but (I don't try hard enough)1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Gym Class Heroes. Cool and Dre
This is. You silly for this one
Whats wrong with me? Its Travie
Why you doing this to me? Ha ha

I started rappin, back of the class, scribbling tracks in hopes
That one of my jokes a have the pretty young things laughing
A chubby little bastard with a nack for little debbie snacks
But what I lacked in looks I made up for it in passion
No advance and plus we make it happen
And ya concious more obnoxious in that laffy taffy snappin
Goodbye yesterday's rags, hello high fashion
Years before you's a man, then built a castle with sand
With no regards for tidal waves I finally established
Til water comes in gallon drums and wipes away my palace
But now I'm sitting lovely off in wonderland with Alice
With purple people passing me at the caterpillars chalice
Ha ha, you probably thinking I'm wrong right
Like I should quit writing these songs right
Tell you what, do it better I just might
Take it back to 86 you wanna lick sike

Don't let the tv mislead you, me and you dude we are not equal
Fuck you this is for my people, fuck you this is for my people
Don't try to hide like I can't see you
Your parents must a been trans you so see through
Fuck you this is for my people, fuck you this is for my people
Put up ya peace sign put ya index down
Put up ya peace sign put ya index down
Put up ya peace sign put ya index down
Put up ya peace sign put ya index down

Before I utter words and before I start to begin
Let me make sure you clear I'm about securring the win
I puzzle up my words while I piece another concoction
Cause I'm stubborn with the thought that failure is never an option
I grinds like a carpenter til my calluses bleed
With the passion from my heart to the many mouths that I feed
That's why I look at most of you stupid I know its odd
Because you can't really do nothing to me unless you God
Well being that none of you ain't him
You can't fuck with me now watch me erase them
Now trust me see I'm so determined
I'm walking through the heap of gauntlets how the fire was burning
Or how the tire was turning on the rim of the V
I laugh and shake it off the shit they be doing to me
With all the yappin and talking and so and so
You think that you could ever stop the kid OH NO

So if you get in my way, you know you done son
You best believe what I say, you better run son
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones
You better kneel down and pray, cause where I come from
We going hard everyday, that's how the fights won
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones
Fuck you because I do this for my loved ones

Look mom no hands (no hands)
Your little boys a man (god damn)
Everything you said is finally setting in
The training wheels fell off and I kept pedaling
Now I'm riding wheelies on this industry
Say the word and I'll ghost ride this bitch instantly
Good looking pop all the strength that you giving me
Wasn't for you GymClass would be history
I'm on my upstate shit
I was Brooklyn broke but now I'm upstate rich
Getting brain from two dames with french accents
I don't mess with local chicks I get em upstate shipped
Ha, you probably thinking I'm wrong right
Like I should quit writing these song right
Tell you what, do it better I just might
Take it back to 86 you wanna lick sike

Now its a lot of y'all that can't stand me
Cause my resemblance to Prince is uncanny
But fuck you this is for my family, fuck you this is for my family
Upstate New York to Miami, Up late recording in my jamies
I do it for my family, fuck you this is for my family

She reached her hand out with a pamphlet and I politely said "No, ma'am"
I mean no disrespect and I apologize if this fucks up your program
You tell me I'm gonna burn for lying but that He can turn water to wine? (laughs)
Well if there's a hell below then we're all gonna' be just fine
So there I stood six feet of sin, a walking contradiction
But am I wrong for posing questions "or am I just another lost soul searching?"
Then she gave me a look so unchristian and told she'd pray for my children
I said, "If you're so holy you'll probably out-live me but if I bought a Jesus piece do you think he'd forgive me?"

Maybe I would be a fool to think
That somewhere in the sky's a place for me
What good would it be to pray for me
You won't save me, don't pray for me

Now I've never been religious
I'm just a big fan of logistics
And if it makes sense then I'm all for it
I even pray if the situation calls for it
Somebody asked me if I believe in miracles
I try to answer without sounding satirical
I'm 3 years past my expiration and yet I'm still fresher than a newborn
So I guess that's my explanation but it's safe to say I've never seen a unicorn and I never chase rainbows
But I hear the devil wears designer clothes
So does God have a favorite brand?
And for that matter, is he even a man?
And will I go to hell for even saying that?
Only time will tell I'm just relaying facts
Maybe I would be a fool to think
That somewhere in the sky's a place for me
What good would it be to pray for me
You won't save me, don't pray for me
{Instrumental}

Maybe I would be a fool to think
That somewhere in the sky's a place for me
What good would it be to pray for me
You won't save me, don't pray for me

Maybe I would be a fool to think
That somewhere in the sky's a place for me
What good would it be to pray for me
You won't save me, don't pray for meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I love it how she breathes booze in the mornin'
Man, it's so sexy how she can't remember last night
I made a fatal mistake of letting her drink again
But who the hell am I to tell her how to live her life?
And if you could put dumb in a shot glass
I'm just another lush who's had one too many in me
And please not enough
I see you stand there, settle for anything, anything's better than lettin' her
Think she could do better than me
She'll come around eventually
Cause baby girl's a queen
But the queen's just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves
And she's made me a fiend
I'm going through withdrawals but I got nothing to lose

Oh no
She's at the bottom of that bottle
She's only one more swallow
From being, oh, so hollow
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Bravo, she's at the bottom of that bottle
She's only one more swallow
From being, oh, so hollow
I find it funny she can never find her car keys
Immediately after telling me she can't take it
She makes the cutest faces when she screams obscenities
And slurs her words because she's never not inebriated
And the front page headline read
"Let the girl go, you know you can do better"
It's bad, when the fact that you can't have her
Is the reason you sweat her
Don't let her take advantage of you
Like the other girls let her
You better cut your losses now buddy
Cause baby girl's a queen
But the queen's just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves
And she's made me a fiend
I'm going through withdrawals but I got nothing to lose


Drown yourself, it's not worth keeping me
Just put it down right now and bow out gracefully
(Cause baby girl's a queen
The queen's just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves
And she's made me a fiend
I'm going through withdrawals but I got nothing to lose)

If I recall correctly
It was the middle of spring
Walkin with my boys
Contemplating what summer will bring
We started talkin about girls
And it was the funniest thing
As I started remembering some of my funniest flings
See there was ashley
She caught my eye the very second that she passed me
I kissed her once
Then she started to harass me
She called all night long
I had to buy a brand new phone
And let me see
There was Melanie
To have a mouth like that should be a felony
Wouldn't believe half the shit that she was tellin me
I mean dirty vocab
She used to talk like she was grown
And after that there was tiffany
The one with the cute cousin
Are you kiddin' me?
She had a man
But that didn't mean shit to me
He tried to catch us all the time
But I was just to god damn smooth
And I can't forget to mention Carrie
But that situation quickly got scary
Cuz after two days she's like 'let's get married'
Can you believe that shit?
I had to pack my bags and move!
(Chorus)
They say I gotta change my evil ways
And I'm workin hard at it every day but
No matter what I do
I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to
If love is just a game that people play
And practice make perfect is what they say
But no matter what I do
I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to
I'll always remember Monica
The Jewish chick
She'd always give me gifts for Hanukkah
To met her folks, she'd try and make me rock a yamaka
But she looked so damn good
She almost made my ass convert
And after that there was Lisa
You know she had a twin sister, Teresa
I bumped into them at Cam's gettin' pizza
The greatest night of my life
Schlep's the rock that kill two birds
And there was Erica
She had the stankest breath in North America
I tried to slip her tic-tacs
But they were scared of her
And when we made out
I always had to plug my nose
And I suppose you know your sister
Chill, I swear my hand to God
I only kissed her
I gotta foot fetish
But she gotta lota blisters
I mean, hammer-time feet
You think she had dead bugs for toes
(Chorus)
They say I gotta change my evil ways
And I'm workin hard at it every day but
No matter what I do
I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to
If love is just a game that people play
And practice make perfect is what they say
But no matter what I do
I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to
Yo Matt, remember Catherine?
She talked so much
I used to make her bring me aspirin
Blah, blah blah blah
I'm doin fine thanks for askin
I even tried to make a muzzle
But her mouth would just not quit
And oh shit
Remember Shawna
I hate to bring her up again
I didn't want her
That girl I talked about
In "That girl's a dog" song
Yea, the poster girl from paxil
Almost made me lose my grip
And oh shit
There was Krystal
The meth head
She used to sniff like a fist full
One time she chased me down the street with a pistol
She tried to say I took her stash
She bugged out and tried to kill my ass
And at last we got Kimmy
She went abroad
Came back
And broke up with me
And so I ripped up all them letters that she sent me
I cried for like 3 days
Then it was back to my evil ways
(Chorus)
They say I gotta change my evil ways
And I'm workin hard at it every day but
No matter what I do
I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to
If love is just a game that people play
And practice make perfect is what they say
But no matter what I do
I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to
(Chorus)
They say I gotta change my evil ways
And I'm workin hard at it every day but
No matter what I do
I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to
If love is just a game that people play
And practice make perfect is what they say
But no matter what I do
I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not toEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(Roll Sloppy Love Jingle Sequence 1. Action!)
Bartender!
"Yeah I hear your wise ass, give me a minute."
I'm trying to get this round over here
"What do you think I'm just working for you here?"
Actually, will you, will you send a drink, to the lady at the end of the bar? Yeah that one right there
"Here you are miss."
Yeah, yeah. It's on me. Tell her it's from Travie
"It's from this guy over here."
From the second she shimmied in
I was intrigued by her essence
And my first instincts to make sure that my presence was felt
Simple and plain
I'm probably jumping the train
But all I could see was my name engraved on her belt
Hit the pause button
Damn!
I don't even know this girl
And I'm already practicing my sweet-nothings
But that's a classic trait of a soft-spoken, heart-broken, fellow like my self best believe (pussy)
I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve
But that night the Jagermeister had my sleeves rolled up
Wait a minute, hold up
I think she caught me grillin' now I'm spillin' my drink (don't look don't look)
I knew our feelings were in sync so now she gave me the wink
The only problem is, I'm not your ordinary, average Romeo
A Cyrano de Bergerac (shut the fuck up)
In fact, I remember back in fifth grade
I tried to read the book of love, but sadly
The introduction didn't grab me
So I left it on the shelf and kept moving
Assuming that this planet rotates
I'll just procrastinate until the day I bump into my soulmate
Who would've thunk I would be pissy ass drunk when time came for collision
So I made the decision to just keep my composure (cool cool)
Until she started getting closer
And then I felt this weird feeling underneath my left shoulder, and then I
Slipped, tripped, busted my lip and fell in love
The minute that she stepped in the door
The type of girl I'd have to make a couple mix tapes for
To me she equaled MC squared and everything else was mathematics
I never took the time to practiceEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I walk on decrepit bricks and kick sticks and rusty soda cans
Simply for lack of better stimulation
Motivation comes and goes like gas station patrons
So sedation compensates for unexpected vacations (thank you)
That's my pre-gratitude
Post-please leave me alone that's just my rude attitude
No dysfunction flipside, I'm just your ordinary citizen
They're waiting patiently for me to sin again, but then again (shit...)
I'm really mommy's little angel
But that angel on my shoulder got strangled
For trying to tangle with his nemesis he caught him on the wrong day
And got cut like DJs spinning doubles (let the fucking song play)
I'm on my way to the store ignoring the city
To purchase a pack of Marb' Reds with a stack of rolled pennies
I could go for Denny's, and my stomach holds plenty
But my pockets got holes, I guess the goal is to stay empty
Quite simply put: me and my pockets share interest
I'll never fall in love with that pretty green-eyed temptress, twice (yeah right)
I learned my lesson the first time
I just couldn't keep up with that ever-changing Jordan line of foot apparel
Parallel to many clones, my eye's vision monochromes
With seven shades and twenty tones
Plus I breath artistic, they eating everything I'm feeding them
Put myself in every painting and use my spit as mat medium
And results of my children, we share the same genes
Cast the same reflection and interpret the same dreams
Like whoa, like whoa, like whoa, like whoa (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (Absolutely no purpose)
Feeling like I'm worthless (Feeling like I'm worthless)
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine
And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (Absolutely no purpose)
Feeling like I'm worthless (Feeling like I'm worthless)
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine

I walk down dead end streets like I didn't see the sign
Just to turn around and walk back
That's fine and dandy, but what's whack is the fact I'm still walking
Like "Thank God for walkmans."
I'm only yawning cause these simply minded mortals make me sleepy
So what do I do? I resort to T.V
In the seemingly lousy attempt to numb myself with lackluster images
And insignificant information like "Willis was really Ty Bridges"
Just to have the upper hand in monotonous conversations
And for lack of better stimulation
I'm painting portraits of dysfunctional families with gloomy faces
Rockin' "Don't Worry, Be Happy" t-shirts, and you're assuming I'm tasteless?
You misconstrue it but your babies will embrace it
The basic essentials of a very bitter young man
That kicks rusty soda cans and walks on decrepit bricks
With a permanent pair of headphones trying to make these lectures stick
I'll let the protestors picket, like they are gonna make a difference
And watch them die before they realize that their cause was nonexistent
Like their cause was nonexistent..
And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (Absolutely no purpose)
Feeling like I'm worthless (Feeling like I'm worthless)
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine
And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (Absolutely no purpose)
Feeling like I'm worthless (Feeling like I'm worthless)
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine

I walk on shitty city sidewalks stepping on every single crack
Reminiscent of that joke we used to say when we were snotty nose
My purpose got defeated when my mind turned paraplegic
Plus I failed my civil service exam, they said I cheated
Not to mention tainted urine samples and the attention span of a second-grader
More fascinated with building blocks than wasting time stressing his daily lesson
Hence the ridilin, I've been gone with the wind like lucky lottery tickets since day one (one)
I stepped on the left cause right's wrong (wrong)
So what do I do? I resort to friendly games of ping pong and sing a song in "Sixpence"
I'm "None the Richer", I just kiss her on the lips and keep trucking

And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (Absolutely no purpose)
Feeling like I'm worthless (Feeling like I'm worthless)
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine
And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (Absolutely no purpose)
Feeling like I'm worthless (Feeling like I'm worthless)
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mineEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
