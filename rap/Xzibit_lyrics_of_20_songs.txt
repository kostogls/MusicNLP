This ain't beef man
I don't know what the fuck to call it
But no beef
What up, X?
Just hit 'em

I float like Big's spirit in this bitch, I'm ghostly
Rush me, 'cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
I'll have my motherfucking ass kicked by Moby
If I let some bitch in the can like 'Bis cop over me
To do war and try to bring my crew back down
I'll never stoop to that level to do that now
I got a new cat, this time I'm pulling two gats out
With bullets (*bang*) I finally got something to shoot at now

Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the Glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who really want their name in the streets
Let's see who wanna die the same time as me and make ends meet
Now was I blessed with a gift or cursed with a curse?
I follow (Ugh!) hearse after hearse spit verse after verse
And I'll be damned if I let Billy "Dance" Dupri
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree
So now!
I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap, my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga, let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name

Why do you hate me? I came from nothing
Blood, sweat, and tears, you did not create me
How can you doubt me? You don't know shit about me
There'd be no West Coast without me
Cut with the bullshit, I struggle for survival
And now you tryna act like my rival?
Watch what you say, partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life, nigga, it's not worth...
All the pain (All the pain), all the agony (All the agony)
All the horror (All the horror), all the tragedy (All the tragedy)
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now!
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life? (C'mon!) One day, you'll understand
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
So who the FUCK! you think you talking to?
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in front of you!
I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap, my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name

I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him
Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
I could have been like Treach, poom-papped and slapped him
Purple, for mimicking him with two rapping Urkels
I could have snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I square dance 'cause I'm sick of rapping circles
Around these clowns, steady trying to call me out
It's like I'm listening to motherfucking dogs meow
You'd probably do better trying to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about (C'mon!)
(I) No gangsta, you ain't either
(Will) But I know that I spit ether
(Not) I should've crossed your belly
(Lose) Show you I'm not R. Kelly
(X!) Pass me the weed
I'ma put my ashes out on his ass for the last time, man:
Watch your fucking mouth
I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap, my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga, let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name

It's the last time, man

Pssh, man, I need a lighter, man (Right here!)
Yeah… whassup, Slim? (What's crackin'?)
Hit this shit (Shit, I almost hit this motherfucker today)
Psh, is that right? (What is it with motherfuckers thinkin' that
Because we're in the spotlight, or whatever, that
They can do or say whatever they want to us
And that we won't retaliate?)
Protect my motherfuckin self, by any means necessary (Right)

‘Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
‘Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do
‘Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
‘Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do

Make no mistake, I'm the Golden State heavyweight
Being underrated gave me time to create
Can you relate? I renovate, straight out the gate
Carried my weight, but seem to receive nothin' but hate
Millionaires snatchin' crumbs off my little son plate
Kidnapped, locked in a trunk and shot in the face
No hoes, no clothes, no one showin' up for my shows
You know how it goes, I might as well kick it at home
But my baby mama hate my guts and can't stand me
Packed up, moved out, started a new family
So all this strugglin' for what, so I can blow up?
Marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up?
Fuck that! This the fuckin' thanks I get
For tryin' to edutain assholes and feed my bitch?
Yo, I feel like my whole life is upside down
‘Cause you seein' more support than I'm seein' my child
It's like, every day I wake up, another drama
It's a wonder I'm alive survivin' this karma
If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer
I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her
Without these cameras in our faces like animals
For your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulance up the avenue
And catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts
And what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence
And you wonder why I carry every gun under the Sun
Whether it's unloaded, full or an unregistered one
No bullets? You're so full of shit
This clip is so full, it'll spit if I don't pull it
And don't give me no bullshit, I'm not in the mood
I just got in a feud in some parking lot with a dude
Over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over this shit
Don't tell me 'bout the show business shit, I know what this is
Bitch

‘Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
‘Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do

This ain't business, this is personal, bitch
You don't know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed
I had a very fucked up day, I'm needin' this fifth
Shuttin' motherfuckers up like they pleadin' the fifth
Yo, Em, it's time to get serious with it
Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet
This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit rain on thugs
Ain't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us
Ain't no love lost, my niggas, relax yourself
I'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin' the wealth
To my niggas who never seen it, I mean it when I holla
At the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones
Got tons of ammo to crack your enamel
Changin' your channel, you played like a fuckin' piano
Ridin' slow through Cali like I'm ridin' a camel
Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels
I feel like Tony Soprano: who do I trust now?
Just hit me on my tele', nigga, soon as I touch down
Spit lines to split spines, just to get mine
Big behind bitches gettin' dick to spit shine
Sniff lines of coke – that's the only shit that make you dope
Bitch-ass nigga that's droppin' the soap
Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip
And turn 'til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit
So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself, a front door with 12 locks
And have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox
And every time somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?
Fuck that! I protect myself with these 12 shots
And one in the chamber, gun in the waist
And one in the ankle, waitin' for someone to come to my place
Tryna walk up and knock, like these cocksuckers are not
Gonna get a shotgun or a Glock shoved in their face
And it's a disgrace Hailie can't play with her toys
In the front yard without you drivin' by honkin' your horn
Screamin' some shit, leanin' out your windows, beepin' and shit
Or pullin' up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip
And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live
So my address ends up on the Internet again
So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin' them
That if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs
And reporters blow it out of proportion
Oh, now he's pullin' guns on his fans, just for tryna stand on his porch
And I'm the bad guy, ‘cause I don't answer my door, like, "Hey! Hi! You guys wants some autographs? Okay, form a straight line!"
Sometimes I feel like loadin' this rifle
And climbin' the roof at night and hidin' outside to snipe you
It's not that I don't like you
It's just that when I'm not behind the mic, I'm a person who's just like you16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
***
Yeah! Ladies and gentleman
Broadcastin' live to you and yours
It's Mr. X to the Z, Xzibit
Yeah, bouncin', c'mon

The first day of the rest of my life
X stand behind the mic like Walter Cronkite
Y'all keep the spotlight, I'm keepin' my rhymes tight
Lose sight of what you believe and call it a night
This ain't the light-weight, cake mix shit that you're used to
Teflon territory you just can't shoot through
You gon' shoot who? (Who?) Not even on your best day
Rollin' the Wild West way, givin' it up
Leavin' the whole world stuck not givin' a fuck
Laid in the cut, now we break through in the rut
Hennesey and orange juice baby fill up a cup
Quick to grab Mary Jane by the butt and squeeze
Loosen up, let your hair down and join the festivities
Overcrowd the house like lockdown facilities
Bitches be quick to give me brains while the pistol range
Goin' up and down my dick like the stock exchange

(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family
Ever since Xzibit could spit, been on some pimp shit
Approach every woman like a potential mistress
Shine bright, make sure that X stay tight
Cause tonight I might meet my next ex-wife
Mr. Big Chief Reefer, Xzibit use his dick like a Visa
I run it through and money come out
Runnin' your mouth, I'll have somebody run in your house
Borrow your spouse and have a little fun on the couch
Now you know that it was bound to happen
I came to give you what you lackin'
Whenever you hear them other niggas rappin'
Rockin' chains, stadiums, paladiums, cracked craniums
My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium
Drop-top tinted on twenties
Usin' rappers like crash test dummies, stackin' real estate and money
It's funny how things change overnight when you thinkin' right
I beat the odds like Ike beat on his first wife

(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family
What an event, we hardcore a hundred percent
Makin' it stick, Los Angeles proudly presents
The real deal, how does it feel? No special effects
Yank the chain off of your neck, demand the respect
Now all your conversations sound strange to me
Seem like everybody around me done changed but me
I stand alone on my own two feet
Stab a track, strangle the beat - Restless, no time for sleep
Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like Benjamin Grimm
It's a very thin line between a foe and a friend
Straight to the chin (Not these niggas again)
Call Doc, bounce to the spot and slide right in
I ain't tryin' to see nothing but progress, regardless
Home of the heartless, move right, remain cautious
Represent nothing but the hustle and struggle
Hennessy, rock plenty of ice, make it a double, and scream

(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around

So there you have it - A-B-C, D-P-G-C
X to the motherfuckin' Z
Mr. Xuberant, Xtravagant, Xtrordinary, Xciting, X-a-lotta
XO with a little bit of Xtacy
X-ing your bitch-ass out if you tryin' to test the G
And what's the recipe? Xcalibur weaponry
And we shoot Xceptionally

Yes, 1996 marks the beginning of a new era
The dysfunctional member of the Alkaholiks family
It’s Xzibit!

Sometimes I wonder if it’s all worth my while
Xzibit stay versatile, with million dollar lifestyle
And I could feel it as a child growing up
The niggas that was real
And the niggas that was scared as fuck
That's why Xzibit only roll with a chosen few
You ain't really real, I can tell when I look at you
So ease off the trigger-talk, you ain’t killin' shit
It’s not affecting me or the niggas that I'm chillin' with
I don’t believe the hype or buy woof tickets
Nigga, you make a gang of noise and never seen, like a cricket
I guess that’s why we never kick it
A lot of niggas is soft and get tossed tryna fuck with the Likwit
How many niggas do you know like this?
Always claimin' that they ridin' but they really turned bitch
It don’t make sense, either you’re a soldier from the start
Or an actor with a record deal tryna play the part—like that!

It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!)
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)
See, I don’t need no lights, no cameras; just action, goddamn it
Never no superstar, I'm more like a planet
So my composure is kept while others start to sweat
Emergin' from the fog with my fucked-up dialogue
Tryna live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt
And niggas you spent it on would not give a fuck
And that’s deep; how deep? It’s deeper than Atlantis
Home of the scandalous: big bad Los Angeles
Dangerous, vandalous, yo, not to be trusted
Now, how the fuck is you hard
Not being scared by the boulevard?
I'm pullin' that card, and saying "Gin, mothafucka!"
Flowin' like liquid; soak it in, mothafucka!
I'm breakin' it down, my sound surrounds like death
From the West, puttin' whole counties to the test
It’s all in perspective, breaker 1-9 copy
This is for the niggas gettin' caught up in the paparazzi

It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!)
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)

Niggas smoke stress and crossdress, but I just play the back
Others going through schemes and pipe dreams for a contract
Real tightly rolled, fuck ’em all how I feel
I made a cool half mill' before I had a record deal
Therefore you look and stare like it’s magic
But too much of anything can make you an addict
Whenever devils be startin' static, break out the automatic
I set it off straight, I spread hate, then I vacate
But wait! Who dares to cross this path?
Yo, I do you like math, cut with glass, make a bloodbath
So on behalf of all niggas I get drunk with
Smokin' blunts with, I dispose of your punk shit
He-he, and keep it all in perspective
Carbon copies gettin' caught up in the paparazzi
Once again, it's the Likwidation crew
And we return at you like this
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!)
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(Come On)
Xzibit (Yeah)
E-Dub

It's that millenium ridiculous flow, I never let go
Niggas gettin' knocked out is part of my show
Let them know who they fuckin' with yo, a rhyme wrangler
Tri-angular push-up the hillside strangler
Dangle a, nigga by the ankle off the balcony
Now let his punk ass go, look out below (below)
It's a tale of two cities, come out when the sun go down
We officially not fuckin' around
Stuck in the ground, fitted with a suit in a pine box
With my fresh pressed khakis and a slingshot
So heatbox all day in a nigga face
And all you bitches see the dick that you should've ate

Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
Yo, I'm in the zone, and lyrically gone
Got the spot blown, (Boom) Oklahoma
Watch the aroma, catch those who love me
My underground dirty cats on dune buggies
I be the type to take your watch and flaunt it
Kidnap T. Lewis and Jimmy Jam on it
Yo, I bang a nigga head 'til his neck pop
Do a KRS-One to a "Black Cop"
X and Es, out for the cream
Get the money, while you stay broker than Al Bundy
Uhh, give it to y'all, in "Any Given Sunday"
With J. Foxx name the spot, make it hot
(I hate E so much right now)
Blow it down hooker bounce, come off the ropes like J. Snuka
(X: Two fly motherfuckers) You can't fuck with it
Backed by Open Bar, so y'all forget it

Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
J-McEnroe, cam smashin', party crashin'
I eat MCs like a ration
I'm sockin' niggas in their goatees
I leave you stiffer than that fool on my basketball trophies
I'm in the room with 10 Gs, counting ten Gs
'Cause we need a bag of weed (can you smell weed?)
Now we need ten dimes, to blow on deez like wind chimes
Time to close the blinds 'cause you all in mines
I bought a bottle for the session, and did not share it
Drink so much Captain Mo' all I need is a parrot
You took the Alkaholik challenge, and lost your balance
You underground, we under water drinkin' liquor by the gallons

Slurred words, double vision, brain bustin', head rushin'
If I'm too drunk to walk, I'll rock a party on crutches
And still rush the roughest MC who wanna get it
Forget it, it's Likwit, Tha Liks and, Xzibit
Ca-Tash on the blast the final piece to the puzzle
I slap bitches on the ass, I slap pits up out the muzzle
I shuffle with the microphone, bang rhymes consistent
You wack and I'm Ca-Tash and that's the motherfuckin' difference
For instance, "21 and Over" set your clocks back (Tick-tock-tick)
Still standin' where the rocks at
Two-thousand-one, we still young guns that's Restless
(Thirty niggas, sixty hoes) and that's the motherfuckin' guest list
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(Yeah) I can drink a whole Henessey fifth
Some call that a problem but I call it a gift
Xzibit make the whole continent shift (hell yeah)
Invadin your territory in a blaze of glory
A soldier story, livin off nothin but instinct
Bitch niggas continue to floss and lip-sync
And I'mma just continue to flow, while rockin the boat
Probably smoke three-hundred thousand dollars in dope
Don't make my Desert Eagle barrel touch the back of your throat
Always approach niggas that's known for killin your folks
Be surprised who could turn around and bust on y'all
Catch your mother or your sister comin out of the mall
Bang holes through they coats and they Macy bags
No retaliation you basically runnin with fags
In these streets, you only good as your last transaction
Funny style, and these niggas ain't laughin
Y'all got it all fucked up in zero-zero
Think life is a video for "Last Action Heroes"
Face the price you pay for the games you play
When it's all said and done at the end of the day, you gotta

Get your walk on, get your head tight
I know you feelin the shit, shit is dead right
Get your bounce on, back dat ass up
Bitch pass me the bottle, fill your glass up
Judge and jury, don't get your case dismissed
When I get pissed and smash through the makeshift
Uplift, dump this, make your shit knock
Hypnotical hardrock that don't flop
It's the best thing crackin my nigga
Lot of rappers talk of flashin the trigger but don't ever deliver
From the home of the toe tag, lowriders and body bags
Earthquakes police with automatics and nerve gas
Learn fast or get left behind quick (yeah)
You testify, you get wrapped in plastic (hell yeah)
Xzibit turn your SUV into a casket
Melt your body parts in a tub full of sulfuric acid
Drastic measures we take just to get by
For all the shit you gotta go through to get high
Stand by, do or die for the WestCoast!
Wanna fuck with Xzibit but can't come close motherfuckers

Get your walk on, get your head tight
I know you feelin the shit, shit is dead right
Get your bounce on, back dat ass up
Bitch pass me the bottle, fill your glass up

Tell y'all people to call my people
Recognize all men are not created equal
I'm lethal, all y'all faggots remain see-through
Only the kid from "The Sixth Sense" can peep you (DEAD PEOPLE!)
When I get through the World'll be a better place
A little Jesus Christ mixed with some Leatherface
Go find some punch to spike, find some dope to lace
Pull a pistol from my waist, nigga reach for space
Smack the taste out of your mouth if you talk shit
Or hit so hard to the chin it make your back flip
My transcript number one up in this conference
It's nonsense, all y'all niggas want is conflict
Only associate with pros and the convicts
Xzibit roll up in the spot with a bomb bitch
And then bounce with a couple, motherfuck a tussle
You never have enough muscle to stop a nigga hustle
Get your walk on, get your head tight
I know you feelin the shit, shit is dead right

Get a grip while the gettin' is good

I don't need that, I don't believe that
E'rybody gon' get hurt, if I do dirt
I flirt with the idea of quittin' the game
Nah!! I'mma evolve continue to change
It take brains, balls and backbones to get it on
And keep it on, we keepin it movin, to each his own
So I spit about it, whatever I feel about it
I'm just bein' real about it; X get hot, nigga forget about it
Speech don't fail me now
Dedicated to the enemies and friends that hold me down

(We) build (We) stack (We) multiply

And back for mo', cause we can't get enough

Above the rest, accept no less
Go ahead, check the game, be my guest
Somethin brand new and heavy to get off my chest
Win time after time 'til there ain't none left
Hardhat, punch the clock, back to work
I'm bigger, stronger, faster, built to hurt
Everybody and anybody who come to my party
Like they ready to get rowdy and touch somebody
Who's that nigga y'all came to see? "X!"
Often imitated, but cannot be, "X!"
What's next, collect respect like paychecks
Straight to the bank with my bitch and have safe sex

I got a sixth sense, that tells me you ain't worth six cents

Whattup Doc? I'm gettin' down to business
Crooked as the cops in the Rampart district
Lose yourself in the music, move it or lose it
Abuse it, let's booze it, please don't confuse it with the

Stacked with the wealth that you can't take witchu
Long range missile, if we got issues
I'mma squeeze this shit and nobody gon' miss you

When I look you in your eyes I can see my own
Straight love manifested in flesh and bone
You's a breath of fresh air in this world of shit
You was born to be a soldier don't ever forget
Hit back when hit, use force that's effective
All these bitches and women—son, please be selective
This is California can't stick your dick in everything
We will survive necessarily by any means
Let no man ever hold you down or suppress you
It's the 90's—the police just arrest you
Disrespect you, on occasion take life
By the time you come of age they'll probably blast on sight
It's a shame they protect them but try to serve us
When your neck is on the line, stand ground then bust
In God we trust but just in case keep it loaded and locked
Ready to rock then shake the spot, the Foundation

You came from a long line of killers and drug dealers
Who forever smoke bud, so it's probably in your blood
Realize you can only run the streets so long
Then the streets run you into the ground then gone
It's kinda ruff trying to teach you what's right from wrong
Same shit different day, it's the same ol' song
If the time ever comes that I meet my match
Take control of my assets, fuck startin' from scratch
Take care of your mother, keep yourself on track
Just cause niggas get behind you don't mean they got your back
Beware of the serpent 'cause there's a time in life
The mothafucker will strike and try to make you loose sight
Don't be a fake motherfucker tryin' to keep shit real
Fill cassettes with idle threats with no guts to kill
Son if you ever pull heat then use it
If you got a chance to walk away then do it
Total domination takes full concentration
In all situations, a solid foundation (yeah yeah)
You are the foundation, beginning of a new generation
I remember hospital hallway, pacin'
I was anxious as fuck to see your face shine
Only to find that yours looked like mine
So it's like I'm livin' twice at the exact same time
In this life you can't press stop then press rewind
Gotta live to the fullest never follow behind..
..no man, have your own plan, expand your mind
Ain't no paper thin game to raise wannabe thugs
This is nothing but love via sattelite Muggs
Take heed when it's your turn to bring new life
Make sure it's the woman you gonna make your wife
Be prepared for the worst, but expect the best
No matter where life takes you come home to the West
Survival takes more than just gats and guns
That's words to live by from a father to a son

Sometimes people, people would get you down
Then get back up, it's not the end of the world
Yeah
Although it may feel like that sometimes
It's so simple, simple, as one, two, three
Back on your feet, you gotta hold your head high
Let 'em know we right here, forever
We ain't going nowhere till the end of the world

Ladies and gentleman, introducing the most impressive
I plan on shaking the planet until I'm convalescent
I never count my blessings, I only count the cost of living
It's hard to buy everything they sell on television
My momma cried religion, I only got my dreams
One day they gonna be reality, can't rip off the seam
If I could just achieve, and not just make-believe
But anybody else is gon' create what only I can see


Standing tall, never fall, after all
My pride is all I got, respect is all I want
And I will never crawl, this a race, so I run
Far from where I begun, look at the man that I've become
Look up in the sky, as long as the sun rise
I'll be on this rhyme, while you waiting for the signs
You mistaken, if you think you takin' what's mine
In a world where the blind lead the blind, I'll be fine
Just like the world keep spinning, I'ma keep winning
Either you rollin' with it or you choose to go against it
Your thoughts are so offensive, so I expose intentions
My offence against opposition is so impressive
So here's a message to all of my competition
My words in this composition, reflects the way I'm livin'
Expecting something different when doing the same thing
Is the true definition of insane

Let them know we right here forever, we ain't going nowhere till the end of the worldEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

And so it was written, and after all these things
I saw another angel come down from heaven
Having great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory
And he cried mightily with a strong voice saying
"Babylon the great has fallen
Has fallen and has become the habitation of devils
And the home to every foul spirit
And a cage of very unclean, and hateful men"

Yeah, what you see is what you get now
Xzibit never wait around for no kickdown, got my own shit loud
Shot heard around the world
Uplift, bench press, arm curl, keep the structure of the temple
To make things simple, my existence is a ripple through time
Only concerned with what is mine, divine
Never monkeyshine, walkin down a very thin line
Holdin heat, runnin crazy in the streets, yeah (What's up?)
Plus the company I keep put in overtime while you oversleep
Don't wanna see none of this evil I speak
Around the atlas, cum laude magna, the super actress
You all get clothe-lined and pinned to the mattress
All day, every day, every which way
Who said you can't have your cake and eat it too (Fuck you!)
This is hard time on Planet Earth, for what it's worth
Xzibit stay in rotation without rehabilitation like this
Players, pimps, hoes, hustlers
Willies, thugs, ballers, busters
Gangstas, macks, everyday, all day
Shot callers, even high rollers keep it moving

What you see is what you get now
The kinda style make the whole world go wild
Bless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone
And no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit

You got more than you bargained for; hit the floor
I pull a fast one to let you know today could be your last one black
Take your breath like an asthma attack
Just a slave like Flavor Flav, "You're blind to the facts"
Mr. X to the Z, tha Liks and King Tee
Guaranteed to bring the house down naturally
Niggas knowin No Limits like Master P
Makin you motherfuckin bastards see (What?)
A whole different breed of MC; realize it's you against me
Catch a three-hundred and sixty degree
Roundhouse to the mouth right
And like the sun, make the hot shit shine bright
I feelin like my whole life is a green light never turn red
Cause I strike like a rattlesnake, lock like a dread
Niggas wanna bump heads, but they better off dead
Came crashin through the door like the Feds, bring it
What you see is what you get now
The kinda style make the whole world go wild
Bless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone
And no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit

The year everybody start to rush
Swingin through is your friendly neighborhood lush
I crack your bottle then watch how Xzibit bust
I regulate like a killer with a nickel plate, I set it straight
Start to shakin you down, breakin new ground, construction work
Heavy artillery, put your dick in the dirt
Stay alert, the game is rough so you might get hurt
Slug burnt through your jacket through your sweater, through your shirt
Get cut from the belly up (What?)
I break the chain, fast lane, suck my sugar cane
I'm tryin to spark a nigga brain while you entertain trivial things
Material things, protected by the underground kings
Who rule the land with an iron fist
The Men in Black, if we flash can't remember shit (Sorry)
You cross me, I'll make you pay like the government, I wanna kill Sam
Cause my package came short twelve grams, get the picture?

Players, pimps, hoes, hustlers
Willies, thugs, ballers, busters
Gangstas, macks, everyday, all day
Shot callers, even high rollers keep it moving
What you see is what you get now
The kinda style make the whole world go wild
Bless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone
And no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Get down, turn around, show me what you got
You a pow-pow, Juggernaut, take it up a notch
Oh my god, wow, take 'em out, let me take a shot
I'mma sit down, get a drink, let you work it out
Step back, I can nearly put it in your mouth
Have a cocktail, never fail, turn your body out
We can set sail, overseas, you cannot pronounce
All the places you will see, currency amounts
Fluctuating, better learn, quickly how to count
We can pass out, wake up, make another drop
Got a pornstar appetite, get it while it's hot
How you ticking like a clock, tie your panties in a knot
Let me crush that, rush that, let me come again
It's a must that I touch that, where do I begin?
In the back? In the front? Damn, show me what it is
Fast lane, with a fast dame, only way to live

Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Show me what it is
Show me what it is
You a bad chick, you deserve every single dollar
And your assets make me wanna come and do the honors
Forecast says, you gon' have some money raining on you
With the chance that it's gonna last all the way until tomorrow
Cash-in, go and put a price tag on it
Cause your ass, I could probably fit a mic stand on it
Refrigerator, or mattress and a nightstand on it
Make a nigga wanna go take a loan, finna own it
You flaunt it, can't lie about that
When you're lying down flat and you're arching up your back
Crazy, face, crazy, taste, crazy, I save you
Practice making babies, maybe
I'm getting a lil' ahead of myself
But I know I put it down better than anyone else, does
But this ain't about love, this about
Two pills, a bottle of champagne and a hot tub

Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Strip down, turn around
Show me what it is
Show me what it is
Show me what it is1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'mma clean this whole shit out like colonics
With words put together better than Sony Electronics
King of the jungle, humbly stay honest
Eat with the lions, swim with piranhas
Gasoline the scene, strike the match
Inferno, I'm too thorough, nigga, so stand back (Whoosh)
I spit shine, get mine and rip rhyme
And make my career take an incline
I'm strict with knives, straight with razors
Good with grenades, great with gauges
Been around the world on a million stages
Watch niggas bitch up and go through changes
I had guns before thugs was in fashion
I mashed out before niggas knew mashing
I knew terror before the plane started crashing
I got punch lines and niggas ain't laughing

I'm gon be here after the smoke die down
Insomnia style, I won't lie down
Fight the good fight, don't need no help
Keep your hands up, defend your self
Move like I move and live life long
Can't move up if ya heart not strong
Get'cha own shit 'cause this shit's mine
Every time I spit I shine
Cocksucker, I preach what I practice, back shit up
Wrap this rap shit up, still acting up
Get found in a trunk of an Acura
Y'all suck like jail and Dracula
X turn up the heat, increase the hatred
Straight stone faced don't fuck with gay shit
So I guess that means I can't fuck with you now
Two down, let off, vacate to new town
It feel like Bishop and Juice now
Got a flame thrower that'll burn big holes through your goose down
Rough sound, same strong background
Been on black, the big boys laying chips down
My whole train of thought is
To body any mothafucker with problems and not get caught
I was blessed with life but I curse to death
I'mma spit til my very last breath - fuck y'all!

I'm gon be here after the smoke die down
Insomnia style, I won't lie down
Fight the good fight, don't need no help
Keep your hands up, defend your self
Move like I move and live life long
Can't move up if ya heart not strong
Get'cha own shit 'cause this shit's mine
Every time I spit I shine
Let me get a three second look, I hit a million dollar target
You ain't came up yet, well nigga let me show ya
Come across dope like planes and boats
Like balloons filled with coke down a Mexican's throat
You ever seen a man get smoked, they shit on they self
Their body shake for a second then it gets dissected
For evidence of the weapon and the people involved
Let one nigga talk, everybody gettin' caught for sureo'
I say that to say this (what?)
If you can't handle the time then ride the bench
Might as well touch ya tail and jump the fence
Castrate ya self, expose the bitch
X go head up, but fuck, never ran from it
I got a gauge with buck shot that you can't stomach
You ain't a killa, you a album filler
You ain't a soldier, you a rap promoter, game over!

I'm gon be here after the smoke die down
Insomnia style, I won't lie down
Fight the good fight, don't need no help
Keep your hands up, defend your self
Move like I move and live life long
Can't move up if ya heart not strong

You better get ready for the war...

It's so frustratin', so many hatin'
Somebody gon' make me break the law
But I ain't waitin', there's no escapin'
You better get ready for the war

A shotgun fanatic, who right back at it
You get mopped and dropped, like a filthy habit
X snatch and grab it, got you hopin' I fail
‘Cause if I fail you'd be happy like a faggot in jail
I'm full retail, guaranteed to sell
In my jet black McLaren, with my mademoiselle
I'm strong-arm steady, you fragile and frail
You think you ready for them steady niggas? I can't tell
Sex sells, so fuck you all, we came to bubble and ball
You gettin' shut down, soon as I touch down
Bust rounds, enemies slayed and cut down
Fully automatic, spittin' rounds with no sound
Break down your whole regime, like an M-16
Make sure the chamber in the barrel is clean
And the spring that's connected to the firin' pin
That's connected to the trigger, when I squeeze it again, begin
Look, my top of the world, the best of the best
King California, LAX
Out the hood, in the penthouse, from the projects
One man, one gun, how the West was won, sing

It's so frustratin', so many hatin'
Somebody gon' make me break the law
But I ain't waitin', there's no escapin'
You better get ready for the war

Hit like a heavyweight, breathe deep, meditate
Make the whole crowd get loud, make 'em levitate
I ride through my city, like a presidential candidate
LAX, Phantom double R, and accelerate
Stack, build, elevate, crash through the prison gate
Generation hate, appetite to eliminate
X-Man don't spit rhymes, I ventilate
Traffic contraband, yeah, banned through the interstate
Got a sick flow, didn't know? Let me demonstrate
Renovate the game, new nigga that you love to hate
The left hand lands, and the right hand devastates
Half part of your face, replaced with a metal plate
Irate, get snatched to a better place
Let the detec's decorate with the yellow tape
Detonate, drop bombs, make the earth shake
In Brazil, with a half mil' in the briefcase
Look, my top of the world, the best of the best
King California, LAX
Out the hood, in the penthouse, from the projects
One man, one gun, how the West was won, sing

It's so frustratin', so many hatin'
Somebody gon' make me break the law
But I ain't waitin', there's no escapin'
You better get ready for the war4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Listen you fuckers, you screwheads
Here's a man who would not take it anymore
A man who stood up against
The scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit
Here is some one who stood up
Here is...
Yeah! Hennessy for Everyone Music proudly presents
Xzibit, movin' at the speed of life
Yeah! Check it

It took a long time comin' but we waited
Xzibit went from underrated, to now most anticipated
Never would of thought that I would rock your set
And get love and respect without no special effects
Only the rugged ruff shit that the hard rock need
Lyrics must contain more than just clothes bitches and weed
Thinkin' how you like to see the next man bleed
Tryin' to glorify greed; livin' life at ridiculous speed - indeed!
The main goal's to achieve, to succeed
Have it laid out for your seed
But the world gets colder every day by day
Physically, mentally gettin' drained by L.A
Trying to find piece of mind is like tryin' to find a gold mine
It just won't happen, no time for relaxin'
Real soldiers of fortune the front line of the action
So never show a nigga what you packin' (You know what I'm sayin?)
It's too much weight to be jugglin'
Who do you picture when you think about strugglin'
Kids in the bed, no food stomach bubbilin'
Or niggas in the E-class heavy drug smugglin'
Movin', yeah!
Yes, movin'
At the speed of life

And plus I feel that no style is darker than mine
There was a time it was all about beats and rhymes
But nowadays the blind just follow the blind
And when I die, niggas still recite these lines
To rock the heads, waterbeds citys and towns
Bringin' strength to the masses that be holdin' it down
The underground! to upper echelon and beyond
Xzibit rock and roll the streets like a vagabond
Nigga wanna trip you gettin' dissed like a blonde bitch
Mackin' to Farrakhan, run game like a marathon
It's here today then tomorrow it's gone
It's the law of the land, a straight modern day Babylon!

Movin', yeah! Yeah! Like this
Like this, at the speed of life
Ah! Bring it live, yeah!

Xzibit lookin' at the earth thru wide angles
I find a stairway to heaven in the city of lost angels
Where small situations turn to heavy altercations
With a heavy-ass price 'cause, niggas don't fight no more!
Before hip-hop was all about drama
Anything for a dollar before Kane fucked Madonna
Xzibit maintain and stayed bent like a comma
Just me and my bottle, we shall lead not follow
Emcees be full of shit but they style be hollow
It seems you've bitten off more than you can possibly swallow
Just a day in the life of a man named X
Only blunts and latex for the opposite sex
You see niggas comin' through to smoke out and pay respect
Ever since fifteen, I been ready for anything
Whatever they bring in any shape form or fashion
I live to the fullest and rock rhyme with a passion
But in the meanwhile if worse comes to worst
Bust a round or bust a verse whatever comes first
Yeah! we got it locked down tight
Xzibit bring truth to the light shit is movin', at the speed of life
Movin'
At the speed of life5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Will the real X to the Z please stand up?
With my niggas and my guns, not givin' a fuck
Stickin 'em up at point blank range
They say the more things change
They stayin the same I can't complain
Type of shit that make you wish you was dead
Make you bite the curb, and stomp down on the back of your head
Blow it out like a afro pick
Attract bitches like flies to shit
Pop pills and ride the dick
Niggas can't swing this quick, I'm Dark McGwire
Bangin' shit over the fence with Rockwilder
Listen, niggas do anything for a dollar, even
Killin' they own, let it be known, it's like
It ain't safe where I'm from
Niggas start beef never knowin the outcome
Rather be caught with it than caught without one
Leave it alone because the life that you save might be your own
It ain't safe where I'm from
Niggas start beef never knowin the outcome
Rather be caught with it than caught without one
Leave it alone because the life that you save might be your own

I'm pullin pistols if you don't break bread
Mr. Wrong Side of the Bed, only get excited for head
Now print this in your industry books
If it wasn't for crooks you niggas'd still sport the Jordache look
Hit the switch, front to back, side to side
Natural born killers never let shit slide
Never rely on the next man to swing for you
A rock and a hard place, duck between the two
And y'all bitches just somethin' to do, don't get it twisted
You're easy like Sunday mornin' and shopliftin'
It go simple as that, I'm never givin' half to a rat
I'd rather bam to your face with a bat
You get tied down to the tracks
Used to make a living cookin' coke to crack, now I can't turn back
This is holocaust rap nigga, overreact
And I'mma bring it to yo' chest like an asthma attack
Ya heard? Yeah
It ain't safe where I'm from
Niggas start beef never knowin the outcome
Rather be caught with it than caught without one
Leave it alone because the life that you save might be your own
It ain't safe where I'm from

Yeah, you thought that this was over
Thought you got away with murder
Watch me murder my deserters
This is congress secret service
Got your epirdermis calling
From the toxins in the water
Use the oxygen to slaughter
This is big business, baby, blood money bringing benefits
Still suffer from the ideology of Willie Lynch
Now it's all making sense, lets breed ignorance
Cause ignorance is bliss, watch the bliss make us filthy rich, bitch

I'm okay now, bring the napalm
I'll fly over and blow you away
No more sunshine, no more playgrounds
I'll fly over and blow you away now
There's no glamour, no guts, no glory
When I fly over, and blow you away
Blow you away now
The fuck can you say now?
I'm loading my napalm

The last shall be first, got dammit planet here we go
Camouflage cowboy, saddle up; rodeo
HIV, Polio, positive identity
Ashes of evil because we can't believe the trinity
Homeland Security, false is superiority
Fuck your intentions and big plans for my community
I ain't afraid to die, fuck you gon' do with that?
I'm coming to find you and wipe you off the fucking map, brrat

I just wanted to live my life like the common man
Have a family, a picket fence with a couple friends
Maybe even walk the dog when the night is right
Such a pretty picture, we dancing under flashing lights
And we wouldn't have a worry, not in the world at all
Watch my favorite sitcom and go outside and mow the lawn
I come inside just in time to see our baby walking
And bringing flowers ain't special because I do it often
I'll be working a 9 to 5 'till I'm old and grey
Then just wither away the dust, watch it float away
And it'll be complete my life because I lived it right
Never lifted my voice in anger just to pacify
I guess it's all eventual how all these chips should fall
How can you appreciate walking if you have never crawled?
Matter of fact, why am I talking, I should be standing tall
Instead I'm in a world full of shit steaming, screaming fuck 'em all
Aerosol arsonist, tagging up the Apocalypse
The narcoleptic masses so I bang completely opposite
All you need is confidence, I don't need no compliments
The system sets the standards, destruction of the obvious
This is for the populous, population genocide
Patriotic duty look alive but never sympathize
Take 'em by surprise, strike 'em early when they rise
When they open up they eyes, but they still so fucking blind
But hey, hey

I think we all have these moments in our life, where we say
Or do things
And we're so sorry for them, really
It's not the way we would have wanted it to come out
Umm, let's face it, this is real life
And this is the thought that was captured from me
That words only share a small portion of the vision that they give witness too

I had to write this in blood, because the ink wouldn't stick
I sold five to six million but, yo, that ain’t really shit
It was supposed to be different, we were supposed to ride out, 
But too much shot his girl, then shot himself in the mouth
Then the steady game form but very soon fell apart, 
‘cause when you just doing all, with no the loyalty in your heart, 
It’s like catching Alzheimers on all these niggers forgetting where they’re coming from
And they’re slowing down, wait a minute, what we’re running from?
This what we’re supposed to do, here’s where we’re supposed to be, 
I hated MTV for trying to play me like a mockery
But that don't bother me, I just fulfill my fucking contract
Small price to pay just to take a piece of mind back
My back, backfire, assassination of my character
Just to make some millions off of America
My younger sister, Erika, just adopted a child, 
My older brother served fifteen, he made it out
Even though my father loved me, I ain’t seen him in a while
Had to fight my baby momma, bitch, give me my nigga now
‘cause he's running out of time and I need him to understand
The way a superior man had build a brand
Niggas talk about my taxes, had to pay to Uncle Sam
I’m surviving cause the mind’s eyes quicker than the hand

Heartbreak, disappointment, my mother died when I was nine
I just wanted to join her
Nah Mr. Joiner, you get to California, I got something for you to do, it was like I was anointed
Resurrected, found my purpose
I remember meeting Dre, being nervous when I would kick my verses
I was virtually worthless, my whole life was a circus
I was sleeping with serpents and I thought it is worth it
Got a call from Paul, told me shit isn’t working
Exchange words, told me tell me that shit in person
He probably told Em, and by the way did he said it unapologetic twisted made about him
I see Slim and he said he didn’t recognize me
Was it that or did he let another man define me
I don’t know, but now I gotta get this all behind me
Follow my calling when I used to follow niggers blindly

I wish I had a better relationship with my uncles
Blood relatives I could turn to when I’m feeling trouble
And talk about my struggles
My uncle John Nail, he only put me on the phone with different females
And this is such a such, nephew, tell 'er, what’s up?
Ain’t even ask about Tremayne and Gatlyn , growing up
Fuck, I drink it all and I smash the bottle
Self medicated numb, but I'mma feel it tomorrow
It feel like pain and sorrow was like a second skin
But now the pain is gone I got my second win
Only the strong live long, you better settle in
I’m fighting for ever, I will never let the devil win
1983, that’s when my journey begins
I searched every world for strength, only to find it within
This for me and my kin, still dying to live
Living life to the fullest 'till I see you again2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Choke me, spank me, pull my hair

Cinnamon, with a taste of honey, it ain't funny
When she walk in the room, I can't help actin a fool
I know what she like, she act right
She act like she ain't gon' survive the night
Without my dick all up in her ass, so quick, so fast
I see her twin towers and I'm ready to crash
Walk around naked witcha beautiful ass
Who the fuck taught ya how to move that fast?
It took time to perfect the stroke, by any note
Maybe we really don't need to drink and smoke
And just try a new position, perfect your dick kissin
Bang on your G-spot 'til your (voice is missin)

I don't want to love, you
I just want to fuck, you
You should bring your friends, through
I'll fuck you and them, too


I work hard when I'm breakin your back, my lil' nyphomaniac
Suck it, swallow it, down the hatch
It ain't a game when she givin me brain, she doin her thang
I'm up all night but I never complain
I don't, waste no time with makeup lines
I just, look in her eyes and read the signs
A lot of dudes wanna pull on her arm
Cause her ass and titties light up a room like a major city
Just look how she fit in them jeans, it ain't fair
She get off too quick, when I pull on her hair
I'm the only nigga that can take you there
I ain't the only one fuckin and I don't care!
She come through with a couple of friends, a couple bottles of gin
And then, that's where the party begins
And I'm the only nigga that's around for blocks
Baby get on top, and don't you stop!

I know you love the way I'm diggin it out
I know it's hard to talk with all this dick in your mouth
Menage-a-trois, for moi, let's figure this out
I drink a Hennessy fifth and sweat the shit out
She don't gotta cheat cause it's a waste of her time
She'll never find another dick that's bigger than mine
Hands and knees side by side, I hit from behind
Flip it up, givin a fuck, we fuck all night
Bottom line, when I straighten your spine
I'm gon' find spots that ain't been hit and blow your mind
Get in line, bitches stay on the grind, cause I'm on mines
Redecorate your hips and lips and thighs
Ain't surprised you can be so pretty and be so nasty
Ass in the air like a pass to Grassi
It's a, thin line between hoes and women
And close my dick with a hat and change the linen

Most niggas get it confused right? Huh, they think it's all chronic and palm trees out this mothafucka, bitches and bikinis, listen, huh

Some niggas is better left alone
I place you underneath the very ground you walkin' on
And ain't no children in this motherfucker, drop your tone
Ain't got no business even fuckin' with no microphones
So yo, it's me against the world, and ain't got shit to lose
My heavy artillery built to make the masses move
I carry tools that'll pick you up and out your shoes
Xzibit bringin' new meanin' to alcohol abuse
I wanna fall up in the spot where all the bitches at
Holdin' somethin' heavy to help you straighten out your back
A couple of drinks and I bend you over the kitchen sink
So what, you think I owe you somethin' bitch for fuckin' me?
(Bitch) Get a grip, misery love company, check it
Xzibit show you the difference between real life and makin' a record
Makin' the moves and connections that you never expected
What good is money and the fame if you never respected
Check it out

You know, who's runnin' these fuckin' streets
(You get involved, you gettin slapped with the heat nigga)
Don't be actin' like your shit don't stink (c'mon)
Y'all ain't fuckin' with X
You know, we roll so fuckin' deep
(Yeah round after round in the middle of the street niggas)
'Cause you're actin' like your shit don't stink
Yo, I ain't afraid of them fuckin' invisible gats
You always bringin' out in your raps
My shit'll quickly make you fold and collapse
My goal to strictly takin' over the map, by any means
Hustle and make more tracks than a heroin fiend
Keep my enemies on a first name basis
And hate them niggas like a skinhead racist
Chuck Taylors and fat laces
Stompin' hoes through y'all turf
I hurt worse than actual childbirth
A chick can suck my dick 'til the bitch squirt (Ah-Ah!)
The song work, so ain't no playin' wit us
Findin out where you rest your head and I'm sprayin it up
The remains that's left behind can probably fit in a cup
You pressin' your luck, you makin' yourselves easy to touch
I'm from the home of the hit 'em up, only two ways
You droppin' some shells or you get 'em up, back in the days
There was a time there was this woman that I want to keep up
But nowadays when I see you I'm just tryin' to fuck
So check it out

You know, who's runnin' these fuckin' streets
(The king of these West Coast gangsta beats niggas)
Always droppin' straight heat so stay the fuck out of the way
You know, we roll so fuckin' deep
(Round after round in the middle of the street niggas)
'Cause you're actin' like your shit don't stink
Y'all ain't fuckin' with Dre
Thangs just ain't the same since he came out
Two thousand and one, came blew the game out
I heard you was hot, blew your flame out
And got the nerve to believe you hold the same clout
I thought I told you, keep my name out of your fuckin' mouth
(But Dr. Dre!) See that's exactly what I'm talkin' bout
That shit right there, that's all day long
Just don't stop, I gots to be alone at the top
Forever ready loaded and locked, with niggas that'll circle yo' block
And let 'em pop 'til some bodies get dropped
It's Doc Holiday in the flesh
(Still) Hold it down, represent, resurrect the West
(Still) Holdin' ground, touchin' down, with my nigga X
(Still) Send a couple through yo' chest if you disrespect
Dr. Dre comin' back (shit) I never left
The number one ranked highest paid celebrity guest
That's eight digits, motherfuckers

You know, who's runnin' these fuckin' streets
(You get involved, you gettin slapped with the heat nigga)
Don't be actin' like your shit don't stink (c'mon)
Y'all ain't fuckin' with X
You know, we roll so fuckin' deep
(Yeah round after round in the middle of the street niggas)
'Cause you're actin' like your shit don't stink (Yo)
Y'all ain't fuckin' with X5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
