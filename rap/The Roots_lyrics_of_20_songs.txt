If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

Somebody told me that this planet was small
We used to live in the same building, on the same floor
And never met before until I'm overseas on tour
And peeped this Ethiopian queen from Philly takin' classes abroad
She studyin' film and photo; flash, focus, record
Said she workin' on a flick, and could my clique do the score?
She said she loved my show in Paris at Élysée Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that things fall apart and tend to shatter
She like, "That shit don't matter", when I get home, get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever; let's link, let's get together
Shit, you think not? Think the Thought went home and forgot?
Time passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot
Tellin' me the things I'm tellin' her is makin' her hot
Started buildin' with her constantly 'round-the-clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop, and keep tellin' me…

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin' a flight
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some old…
Another lonely night
Seem like I'm on the side, you only lovin' your mic
I know you gotta get that paper, daddy, keep that shit tight
But, yo, I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me?
While politickin' with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty—psych
I'm playin', boo, you know it's just with you I'm stayin', boo
And when cats be poppin' game, I don't hear what they sayin', boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes, I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweatin' on stage, think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listenin' to your homies, they be leadin' you blind
Yeah, so what you sayin'? I can trust you?
Is you crazy?! You my king, for real
But sometimes relationships get ill, no doubt...

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
That snake could be that chick and that rat could be that cool cat
That's whisperin', "She tryin' to play you for the fool, Black"
If something's on your chest, then let it be known
See, I'm not your every-five-minutes-all-on-the-phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be, I ain't on some "Oh, I'm a celebrity!"
I deal with the real, so if it's artificial, let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listenin' to they squads and listenin' to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where they whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, and she like…

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or...52EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Knocked up 9 months ago
And what she finna have? She don't know
She want neo-soul, this hip-hop is old
She don't want no Rock n' Roll
She want platinum or ice and gold
She want a whole lot of something to fold
If you a obstacle, she just drop you cold
Cause one monkey don't stop the show
Little Mary is bad, and these streets she done ran
Ever since when the heat began
I told her "Girl, look here, calm down, I'mma hold your hand
To enable you to peep the plan, cause you's quick to learn
We can make money to burn if you allow me to lay this game"
I don't ask for much but enough room to spread my wings
And the world finna know my name

I don't ask for much these days
And I don't bitch and whine if I don't get my way
I only want to fertilize another behind my lover's back
I sit and watch it grow roots standing where I'm at
Fertilize another behind my lover's back
And I'm keeping my secrets mine

I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight
I would name her "Rock n' Roll"
Uh huh, Cadillac need space to roam
Where we heading for? She don't know
We in the city where the pros shake, rattle, and roll
And I'm a gad-dang rolling stone
I don't beg, I can hold my own
I don't break, I can hold the chrome
And it's weighing a ton and I'm a son of a gun
My code name is The Only One
And Black Thought is bad, these streets he done ran
Ever since when the game began
I never played the fool, matter of fact, I been keeping it cool
Since money been changing hands, and I'm left to shine
The legacy that I leave behind be the seed that'll keep the flame
I don't ask for much, but enough room to spread these wings
And the world finna know my name, now listen to me

I don't beg from no rich man
And I don't scream and kick
When his shit don't fall in my hands, man
Cause I know how to steal
Fertilize another against my lover's will
I lick the opposition cause she don't take no pill
Ooh, ooh, ooh no, dear
You'll be keeping my legend alive
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right
If Mary drop my baby girl tonight
I would name her "Rock-n-roll"
Oh, break it down, break it down, down for me

I push my seed somewhere deep in her chest
I push it naked cause I've taken my test
Deliver it Mary: it don't matter the sex
I'm gonna name it "Rock-N-Roll"

I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right
If Mary drop my baby girl tonight
I would name her "Rock-n-roll"
I would name her "Rock-n-roll"
I would name her "Rock-n-roll", yeah
I would name it "Rock-n-roll"9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The Hamilton Mixtape
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Ayo, mugshot, gun shot, dope shot, jump shot
Take your pick—but you only get one shot
Advice from a schoolteacher to a young tot
Applyin' a sticker to his Spider-man lunchbox
When even role models tell us we're born to be felons
We're never gettin' into Harvard or Carnegie Mellon
And we gon' end up either robbin' somebody or killin'
It's not fair that's all they can tell us
That's why I hustle hella hard, never celebrate a holiday
That'll be the day I coulda finally hit the lottery
I refuse to ever lose or throw my shot away
Or chalk it up as just another one that got away
So I'm unapologetic, I'm on my calisthenics
If I have given it all I got I cannot regret it
My point of destination's different from where I was headed
'Cause I'ma shoot for the stars to get it
One shot

I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
Yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot
I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
No, I'm not throwin' away my shot
Yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot
When opportunity knock, you don't send anyone to get it
Answer the door, welcome it, let it in, or regret it
They said if you can't beat 'em, you join 'em
I say, "Forget it"
'Cause once you join 'em you're buildin' a ceilin' the way you're headed
Be American, express how you feel and take the credit
Don't settle for 87, go premium unleaded and
Take off, shake all the hate off, it's over
It's they loss, the payoff's their weight off your shoulders
Must admit, I'm feelin', um, kinda, um
Lighter as a writer with this fire and desire to go higher
Than a stealth fighter pilot with my eye on every prize
I surprise you guys, I'm a prize fighter (Yeah)
My nine to five describe your scribe, survive minor
Setbacks and take steps back from pied pipers
Be leaders, believers in yourself and mean it
I mean you only get one shot, take it or leave it

I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
Yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot
I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
No, I'm not throwin' away my shot
Ayo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot
Rise up
If you livin' on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up
When are folks like me and you gonna rise up?
Every city, every hood, we need to rise up
All my soldiers, what's good? We need to wise up
We ain't got no other choice, we need to wise up
Rise up!

Throughout my travels and journeys through life I've been searchin'
And been learnin' to be the type of person
To display how determined I get when I'm certain
Inside I feel that fire that's burnin'
Like a knife that is turnin', I fight while I'm hurtin'
Sometimes they're right 'cause life is a burden
Like the pain from a bite that'll worsen
Tryna stifle the light that'll shine on me first and
Before I ride in a hearse and
My breathing stops
And never take my one shot I got 'fore I lie in the earth
And now I come again holdin' down Hamilton Hercules Mulligan
Readin' in Vanity Fair or the Huffington
Done with the sufferin', we in the guts again, family rushin' in
Wonder where Busta been
Feelin' the hunger and feedin' the lust to win (Lust to win)
See I've been patiently waitin' for this moment
To rise up again, that's the way I was molded
And as the last one standin' as the rest of them foldin'
Give me my one chance to grab the torch and properly hold it
I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
Ayo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot
I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
No, I'm not throwin' away my shot
Ayo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot
I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
Ayo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot
I said I'm not throwin' away my shot
No, I'm not throwin' away my shot
Ayo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot
It's time to take a shot

I did it all for the money, Lord, it's what it seems
Well in the world of night terrors, it's hard to dream
They holl'in', "Cash rules everything," just call it cream
'Cause when it rises to the top, you get the finer things
Ocean fronts, rolling blunts with model chickens
Saying grace over lobster and steak
Like, please forgive us for riding Benzes with camera plates
Too busy looking backwards for jackers to pump my brakes
For help signs to symbolize the lives that hunger takes
Addicted to the green; if I don't ball, I get the shakes
I'd give it all for a peace of mind, for Heaven's sakes
My heart's so heavy that the ropes that hold my casket breaks
'Cause everything that wasn't for me, I had to chase
I had to take, I had to take

They told me that the ends
Won't justify the means
And they told me at the end
It won't justify the dreams
That I've had since a child
Maybe I'll throw in the towel
Make my (Make my), make my (Make my)
Departure from the world
Tryna control the fits of panic
Unwritten and unraveled, it's the dead man's pedantic
Whatever—see, it's really just a matter of semantics
When everybody's fresh out of collateral to damage
And my splaying got me praying like a mantis
I begin to vanish, feel the pull of the blank canvas
I'm contemplating that special dedication
To whoever it concern, my letter of resignation
Fading back to black, my dark coronation
The heat of the day, the long robe of muerte
That soul is in the atmosphere like airplay
If there's a Heaven, I can't find the stairway
They told me that the ends
Won't justify the means
And they told me at the end
It won't justify the dreams
That I've had since a child
Maybe I'll throw in the towel
Make my (Make my), make my (Make my)
Departure from the world17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Two—

Yo, we obviously need to tone it down a bit
Running 'round town, spending time like it’s counterfeit
Everybody catching hay fever like sinuses
Step in my arena, let me show y’all who the highness is
You might say I could be doing something positive
Humble head down, low and broke like promises
Soaking and broken in a joke like comics is
Not enough paper to be paying folks compliments
But when that paper got low, so did my tolerance
And it ain’t no truth in a dare without the consequence
Listen, if it not for these hood inventions
I'd be just another kid from the block with no intentions
On the dock of that bay, serving a life sentence
Even if I’m going to Hell, I’m gonna make an entrance, yeah
Let 'em know I’m getting cheese like omelets is
But I’m the toast of the town like Thomas is

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry 'bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I make it to the other side (Make it to the other side)
That’s when we’ll settle up the score
Yo, we did this in remembrance of
Faces from the past we no longer have an image of
Carrying coldblooded hearts that never been for love
Brothers keep going for theirs, but never get enough
World travelers that seen it all and did enough
Only to return and learn the world wasn’t big enough
Damn, how long has it been? I guess the jig is up
Now, all I know is I’m about to wake this nigga up
Yeah, that hindsight 20/20
Now, niggas dead on the money
Try to take something from me, it’s a wrap like a mummy
Undun, I am becoming
And when he’s tired of running through the layers of the onion
He’ll probably shed a tear 'cause there’ll be no more fast times
Just his weak mind, scrolled out like a bad sign
He never had enough and got confused when they asked why
Life is only a moment in time, and it passed by

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I make it to the other side (Make it to the other side)
That’s when we’ll settle up the score
I’m sitting on top of the world, ready to jump off
Thinking of various ways to break a gun law
Thinking that enough is enough, but still, I want more
Thinking how I’m playing with fire that burned my young boy
Any means necessary, don’t give a damn
So every night, I’m on a flight that never lands
Be an asshole when the shit hits the fan
Or bet your life on a bluff and a bad hand
Can’t win, can’t lose, get 'em gassed, leave 'em leaking fuel
Either way, the market moves
Cash rules, kings, queens, prince, and princess
Every night, I’m crossing a line that ain’t the finish
Every thought is dark as a glass of fucking Guinness
Too far gone to come back to my senses
Now, I’m on the edge of my bed, making love to my meds
Every moment's like a pistol to my head when I’m getting mine

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I make it to the other side (Make it to the other side)
That’s when we’ll settle up the score
Score, score, score, score, score
Score, score, score, score
Score, score, score, score
Score, score, score...7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Like when autumn leaves
Fall down from the trees
There goes my honeybee

I’ve lost a lot of sleep to dreams
And I do not miss them yet
I wouldn’t wish them on the worst of enemies
Let them burn, go from here
Like when autumn leaves

To catch a thief, who stole the soul I prayed to keep
Insomniac, bad dreams got me losing sleep
I’m dead tired, my mind playing tricks, deceit
A face in the glass, unable to admit defeat
All that I am, all that I was is history
The past unraveled, adding insult to this injury
I’m fighting the battle for the soul of the century
Destiny is everything that I pretend to be
Look, and what I did came back to me eventually
The music played on and told me I was meant to be awake
It’s unresolved like everything I had at stake
Illegal activity controls my Black symphony
Orchestrated like it happened incidentally
Oh, there I go, from a man to a memory
Damn, I wonder if my fam will remember me
I’ve lost a lot of sleep to dreams
And I do not miss them yet
I wouldn’t wish them on the worst of enemies
Let them burn, go from here
Like when autumn leaves12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Ohhhh
The fire, the fire
Ohhhh
The fire, the fire

There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn
You don't say, "Good luck"
You say, "Don't give up"
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn

Yeah, and if I'm ever at the crossroads
And start feeling mixed signals like Morse code
My soul start to grow colder than the North Pole
I try to focus on the hole of where the torch goes
And in tradition of these legendary sports pros
As far as I can see, I've made it to the threshold
Lord knows I've waited for this a lifetime
And I'm an icon when I let my light shine
Shine bright as an example of a champion
Taking the advantage, never copping out or cancelling
Burn like a chariot, learn how to carry it
Maverick, always above and beyond average
Fuel to the flame that I train with and travel with
Something in my eyes say I'm so close to having the prize
I realized I'm supposed to reach for the skies
Never let somebody try to tell you otherwise
There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn
You don't say, "Good luck"
You say, "Don't give up"
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn

One love, one game, one desire
One flame, one bonfire, let it burn higher
I never show signs of fatigue or turn tired
Cause I'm the definition of tragedy turned triumph
It's David and Goliath, I made it to the eye of the storm
Feeling torn like they fed me to the lions
Before my time start to wind down like the Mayans
I show 'em how I got the grind down like a science
It sounds like a riot on hush, it's so quiet
The only thing I hear is my heart, I'm inspired
By the challenge that I find myself standing eye to eye with
Then move like a wise warrior and not a coward
You can't escape the history that you was meant to make
That's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take
You came to celebrate, I came to cerebrate
I hate losing, I refuse to make the same mistake
Ohhhh
The fire, the fire
Ohhhh
The fire, the fire

There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn
You don't say, "Good luck"
You say, "Don't give up"
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn

Ohhhh
The fire, inside you
The fire, inside you
The fire, inside you11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Yo, yo
Lost generation, fast-paced nation
World population confront they frustration
The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
It's all contractual and about money-makin'
Pretend-to-be cats don't seem to know they limitation
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man? Then stand your own
To emcee require skills, I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep frontin' and roam like a cellular phone
Far from home, givin' crowds what they wantin'
Official hip-hop consumption, The Fifth thumpin'
Keepin' your party jumpin' with an original somethin'
Yo, I dedicate this to the one-dimensional
No imagination, excuse for perpetration
My man came over and said, "Yo, we thought we heard you"
Joke's on you; you heard a bitin'-ass crew, but, um

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
The game is ill-natured, it's nothin' sacred
Aiyo, it's funny what I see some rap niggas do to make it
A few'll blow up, or go as far as they can take it
My nine-to-five is just to hit ya, get the party live
I'm Black Thought, used to rap for sport
Now the rhyme-sayin', rent-payin' life support
I take it very seriously within this industry
It's various crews that try to touch me
But I come with the beautiful things, and I bless the track plushly
Around the world crowds love me from doin' tours
Recipient of applause from all of you and yours
Creator of original sounds that's in the stores
You take home to absorb and sweat it out your pores
Now, who can stop the music runnin' through these veins?
Infinitely go against the grain, that's why my motto's to

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Livin' the life of limos and lights
Airplanes and trains, short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick, they hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission, welcomin' to the dark
When I first spark the art's when the listenin' start
Open your head wide, and let the Thought inside
My style fortified by all of Philadelph-i
My delph more stealth than all the wicked wealth-y
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short, "I want it made" like Ed, 'nuff said
Then after that, I'm puttin' on my cousin Hamed
We let the ladies blend with the dark-skinned thoroughbred
And discover, my level is that of no other
And Roots crew reign official and true while I'm continuin' to
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yo, the spirit in the sky scream, "Homicide!"
But it was time to ride on some niggas funny talking
If too much money talking, we make 'em economize
Real rap, no tale spinning, such is the life of a kamika-
Ze pilot, we wilding out of control
Until we all make the funny papers like Comic Con
Feared in all streets
So if you ever see me out in y’all streets, find another one to occupy
I never hope for the best, I wish a nigga would
Turn around and walk away, I wish a nigga could
Listen to my instincts and say, "Fuck the rest"
But once you had the best, "better" ain’t as good
Weakheartedness cannot be involved
Stick to the script, nigga, fuck your improv
Like a samurai, the streets' Hammurabi Code
Play your part, shut the fuck up, and do as I was told

I was always late for the bus
Just once, can I be on time?
Then I start to think, "What’s the rush?"
Who wants to be on time?
Feeling unlucky
And if I ever got lucky, it was one time
In this crazy world
Not a thing I fear besides fear itself
This is clearly a lesson learned for someone else
Reach for the crown of thorns upon the shelf
Cross around my neck, I’ve been taught by stealth
Capture this moment in time, it’s a smash-and-grab
And where my party people? Y’all finna have a blast
You say, "Goodbye," I say, "Hello"—first and last
Hello, hello, now all of y’all elevate your glass
To an example of what time'll do to you
When those nameless things just keep on eluding you
When shit is new to you and lies is true to you
Words of suspects, usual, coming though to you
Man, I guess if I was ever lucky, it was one time
Then I went missing, looking for the sublime
A nigga stayed low, left the ladder unclimbed
Time after time, verse blank, the line unrhymed

You ever wonder, what’s the big fuss
For everyone be on time?
What’s the big deal? Why do they feel?
The need to have us marching on line
Feeling unlucky
And if I’d ever got lucky, it'd be one time
In this crazy world
I wonder, when you die, do you hear harps and bagpipes?
If you born on the other side of the crack pipe
Niggas learn math just to understand the crack price
Then dive in headfirst like a jackknife
'Cause out here, yo, you niggas can’t belly-flop
If you wanna make the noise inside your belly stop
"On time" means being on the front line
Being on the front line means ducking one-time
The pendulum swinging my way, couldn’t be more blind
Niggas talk to the cops? Not even one time
'Cause we all going down just like the subprime
Or a cheap-ass half-gallon of Ballantine
But hopping over gates to escape is sublime
Been through the alleyway and down to the sub line
Tales from the streets, a life of high crime
To make it to the bottom, such a high climb

I was always late for the bus
Just once, can I be on time?
Then I start to think, "What’s the rush?"
Who wants to be on time?
Feeling unlucky
And if I ever got lucky, it was one time

I’m in the double-G, three-piece tux
Screaming, "Dressed to kill," hope somebody call my bluff
It’s a full house, sipping on a Royal Flush
Two queens is on my cuffs, good times is in the cards
Living on borrowed time, I’m paying the extra charge
To feel like something small is worth a hundred large
Swag is on retard, charm is on massage
Wit is "en garde"—I challenge you to a duel
Who needs a chain when every thought's a jewel?
God bless the weirdo when everyone’s a fool
Fuck a genie and three wishes
I just want a bottle, a place to write my novel
I am heroin to those that hear a rhyme and think:
"How do you find this upper echelon?"
It's time, let’s toast to better days
A beautiful mind and a flow that never age
Come get your kool on

Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine, stars are made to shine

Yo, I’m never sleeping like I’m on methamphetamines
Move like my enemy ten steps ahead of me
Say my reputation precede me like a pedigree
Gentlemanly gangster steez beyond the seventies
Holding fast money without running out of patience
Move in silence without running up in places
Cake by the layers, rich, but never famous
Hustle anonymous, still remain nameless
In hindsight, gold come in bars like a Klondike
The minute before the storm hit is what I’m calm like
Suited and booted for a shooting like it’s prom night
It’s suicide, right? Pursuers tried, like
To no avail, and a hero's what they died like
I got 'em waiting on the news like I’m Cronkite
Not in the limelight or needed for crime, right?
No boasts, just bodied, and chalked close to the line-sight
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine, stars are made to shine

Yeah, outside where the killers and the dealers swarm
And inside, they dressed up like it’s a telethon
Black tie affair, but they holding heavy arms
Straight cash with a stash in the cummerbund
More Bacardi, yeah, the bastards of the party home
Riots erupting around and still we party on
Been a quantum leap to a king from a pawn
But it was destined, the conclusion was foregone
Serenade of the former slave promenade
'Cause them long days in the sun have now become shade
So we doing high speeds in the narrow lane
Say "Cheese," freefalling from the aeroplane
Another feather in the cap
For all the years that we spent in luxury's lap without looking back
'Cause memories could sting like a hornet
Damn, it felt good to see people up on it
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine, stars are made to shine5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah! That all mighty amazin', ill, highly contagious
Kamikaze South splash like it shot from a gauge
Until your body sound clash
Head of the Class, Magna Cum Laude
Beats bring the beast out me, flagrant foul rowdy
Reed pipe but deep tight, disposition keep on flippin'
Keep 'em playin' they position
Keep makin' the people listen what I spin
Put 'em out on a limb
Got tears, got blood, got sweat leakin' out of the pen
Y'all fake niggas not settin' a trend
We never listen to them
It's like tryin' to take a piss in the wind
My home team doin' visitors in, yo, don't test 'em
They all standin' close to the edge, so don't stress 'em
Now, who the type built to last? It's no question
The master, villain in black wit' no Stetson
My sound hittin' you hard from every direction
Your head and shoulder area, your midsection, dawg!

When the saint on the ground with his nine on line
With the niggers who grind with King Kong hittin' Thailand
Give it here, and don’t say nuthin'
Just give it here, give it here and don’t say nuthin'
When the team on the set with the guns gone clap
Gettin' down on everything, hmmm, cut the check
Give it here, and don't say nuthin
Just give it here, give it here and don't say nuthin
Yeah, Illadel! Home of the original gun-clappers
Out on the wrong corner, your shit'll get spun backwards
You got the fool wantin' the rules, enter at risk
Or your own nana'll keep a gat under the mattress
Shorties runnin' reckless from Philly to Texas
Surprisin' what niggas willin' to do to get a necklace
Some emotions felt better left unexpressed at times
Niggas' crime record longer than a guest list
Yes, I done seen things you wouldn't believe
Seen people reach levels thought they'd never achieve
Silhouettes waitin' in the wings ready to D
Thirsty sheists who need at least a buck to breathe
C'mon! Stick up kids, they be out to tax
Most times, they be stickin' you without the gats
I'll still be on the grind when it all collapse
And if it’s mine, word is bond, I'mma take it right back, nigga

When the saint on the ground with his nine on line
With the niggers who grind with King Kong hittin' Thailand
Give it here. and don’t say nuthin'
Just give it here, give it here and don’t say nuthin'
When the team on the set with the guns gone clap
Gettin' down on everything, hmmm, cut the check
Give it here, and don't say nuthin
Just give it here, give it here and don't say nuthin
Yeah, it ain't nothin like the rush I get in front of the band
On stage, wit' the planet in the palm of my hand
When a brother transform from anonymous man
To the force, crush whoever might of thought I was playin'
I'mma flame some sinister shit, the code twister
Slang thicker than Big Boi baby mom’s sister
Pain beyond measure, relaxed under pressure
You see the master piece, but to me it's unperfected
Give it here, Geffen Records, I'm off the handle
Cut the check, and yo, it better be as heavy as anvil
Next joint comin', all bets is canceled
Nigga Black Ink, Grand Wizzard, Gee Financial
We finna have the whole industry at a standstill
See me put the system on lock like Camp Hill
So get wit' them endorsements, and call reinforcements
'Cause my clique come a full sizable portion

When the saint on the ground with his nine on line
With the niggers who grind with King Kong hittin' Thailand
Give it here. and don’t say nuthin'
Just give it here, give it here and don’t say nuthin'
When the team on the set with the guns gone clap
Gettin' down on everything, hmmm, cut the check
Give it here, and don't say nuthin
Just give it here, give it here and don't say nuthin6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If you can‘t swiz-zim, then you're bound to driz-zown
Passing out life jackets, 'bout to go di-down
Get down with the captain, or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss, I’ma hit you with this
Now, if you can‘t swiz-zim, then you're bound to driz-zown
Passing out life jackets, 'bout to go di-down
Get down with the captain, or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss, I’ma hit you with... this

And no one’s in the lighthouse
You’re face-down in the ocean
And no one’s in the lighthouse
And it seems like you just screamed
It’s no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there’s no one there
That cares if you drown
Face-down in the ocean

Smoking cheap weed, sipping on cheap vodka
Yo, pick your poison, down Davy Jones’ locker
It’s rum we be wanting, by the tons, my consumption
Take a look at my lungs and my liver, it’s disgusting
Take a look at the man in the mirror, we start fussing
Only one person gets hurt when throwing punches: me
And the man behind the glass just laughs
The waves come over my head and just crash
My hand start bleeding, water starts receding
A feeling comes into my heart, I start believing that—
I actually might survive through the evening
Survive on my own thoughts of suicide that’s competing
With thoughts of tryna stay alive, which been weakened
By the feeling of putting on a smile while being beaten
The fear of drowning, still diving in the deep end
The waters carried me so far, you can’t reach him
And it feels like there’s no one...
And no one’s in the lighthouse
You’re face-down in the ocean
And no one’s in the lighthouse
And it seems like you just screamed
It’s no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there’s no one there
That cares if you drown
Face down in the ocean

After the love is lost
Friendship dissolves, and even blood is lost
Where did it begin? The way we did each other wrong
Troubled water neither one of us could swim across
I stopped holding my breath, now am I better off?
There, without a trace, and you in my head and all?
The halted motion of a rebel without a pause
What it do is done 'til you are dead and gone
The Grim Reaper telling me to swim deeper
Where the people go to—lo and behold, the Soul Keeper
I’m not even breaking out in a sweat or cold fever
But I’m never paying up on my debt—or tolls, either
I’ll leave the memories here, I won’t need 'em
If I stop thinking and lie—now, that’s freedom
Your body’s part of the maritime museum
And face-down in the past is where I’m being
And no one’s in the lighthouse
You’re face-down in the ocean
And no one’s in the lighthouse
And it seems like you just screamed
It’s no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there’s no one there
That cares if you drown
You're face-down in the ocean

If you can‘t swiz-zim, then you're bound to driz-zown
Passing out life jackets, 'bout to go di-down
Get down with the captain, or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss, I’ma hit you with this
Now, if you can‘t swiz-zim, then you're bound to driz-zown
Passing out life jackets, 'bout to go di-down
Get down with the captain, or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss, I’ma hit you with... this6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Lights, camera, chemical reaction
Attracted to a body of lies with fat asses
Thank the Most High for the high of high fashion
My art of war is killer couture, denim assassin
Am I, am I a douchebag or just another du-rag
Tryin' get ahead on some brand new wave shit?
For your entertainment, money is the language
So every time I speak, I’m tryna make another payment
I do ‘em dirty, sleep and get a dirt nap
That works, 'til my P.O. ask me where I work at
Think I would learned that sleeping in the bird trap
Living on the run like somebody tryin' burn fat
I don’t give a fuck, now maybe that’s abstinence
Or the arrogance of someone who ain’t got shit
That think money over bitches is a stock tip (Tip, tip, tip, tip)

I live in a trap where things go crack
Wake up in the box with a box of Apple Jacks
Everybody acts like God is all that
But I got the feelin' he ain’t never coming back
So I got an angel that answer my prayer
Floating on the cloud that I blow in the air
Nobody wins, but nobody cares
They just want blood when the people cheer
I’m down to 95 dollars, that’s the extent of my riches
Out of 99 problems, 98 of ‘em is bitches
Out here hollerin', what’s ironic is I’ve honestly been tryna do what’s right
But some jawn legs in the air tonight like Phil Collins
I’m a sex-addicted introvert, sucker for a pencil skirt
Looking for a shorty coming from work, that I can pervert
On my existential grind doing consequential dirt
Searchin’ for physical pleasure if I don’t go mental first
Molly poppin’, trolley hoppin’, know somebody prolly watchin’
That ain’t stoppin’ me from coppin’ a feel, karate choppin’
In this after-hours spot, watching mommy body rockin’
First I feed her vodka shots then she eat my Johnnie Cochran
Livin’ fast, drinkin' Capt', one of them hoes even had
The audacity ask me how long this thing would last
I said, "You wanna pay for class? Get on that stage and shake your ass"
She keep a dick in a box in an emergency, break the glass
I make her laugh, she makes it clap
And then she gives me lap dances and I’m thankful that
She keeps providing the place for me to be unfaithful at
(Be unfaithful at, be unfaithful at, be unfaithful at)

I live in a trap where things go crack
Wake up in the box with a box of Apple Jacks
Everybody acts like God is all that
But I got the feelin' he ain’t never coming back
So I got an angel that answer my prayer
Floating on the cloud that I blow in the air
Nobody wins, but nobody cares
They just want blood when the people cheer20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I drew a two of hearts from a deck of cards
A stock trick from my empty repertoire
Another hopeless story, never read at all
I’m better off looking for the end, where the credits are
It’s a pain living life against the grain
I’m looking back, and y’all look the same
Troy, Mark, and Lil' What’s-His-Name
Memory is rerunning it all
It’s the flight of my fall, and it’s right on the wall

I remember
Can you remember
How it was? I do
Remember, do you?
I remember
Can you remember
How it was? I do
Remember, do you?

I used to ride the train to the same two stops
And look at the graffiti on the rooftops
Like the same song playing on the jukebox
Joint called "Faded Polaroids in a Shoebox"
Regardless to what the cadence is
It can’t be forgotten, like auld acquaintances
I realize how depressing of a place it is
And, when I notice my reflection, whose face it is
I remember
Can you remember
How it was? I do
Remember, do you?
I remember
Can you remember
How it was? I do
Remember, do you?


I remember
Can you remember
How it was? I do
Remember, do you?
I remember
Can you remember
How it was? I do
Remember, do you?

It’s only human to express the way you really feel
But that same humanity is my Achilles’ heel
A leopard can’t change its spots, and never will
So I’m forever ill, now, I can never chill
What’s keeping me from breaking out, like Benadryl
When my baptism of fire resulted in a kill
Sometimes, it’s as cut-and-dry as a business deal
You gotta cause the blood of a close friend to spill
But you remember still4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Everything's changing around me
And I want to change too
It's one thing I know
It ain't cool being no fool
I feel different today
I don't know what else to say
But I'ma get my shit together
It's now or never
(Now or never, now or never)
(Now or never, now or never)

Uhh, I'm sick, sick of waiting in vain, tired of playing the game
Thinking of making a change, finally breaking the chains
Every phase, every happening craze
When it's said and done, my head is right back in a haze
I'm ready for the next chapter and page to start acting my age
And part ways with Black Thought from back in the days
I'm stargazing from the back of the stage
Questioning if who y'all praise is worthy of praise
What's the phrase "bygones is bygones?"
Niggas who used to be the underdogs is icons
People say the light shines once in a lifetime
Is this midlife kind a crisis a little bit like mine?
I'm thinking not now but right now
I need some kinda sign that the future is bright now
I fuck around, do the right thing like Spike now
The quick and the dead, which one is my lookalike now?
I'm moving ahead
Everything's changing around me
And I want to change too
It's one thing I know
It ain't cool being no fool
I feel different today
I don't know what else to say
But I'ma get my shit together
It's now or never
(Now or never, now or never)
(Now or never, now or never)

Yo, opportunities lost because I blew them
On the sunniest days of my life, I cried through them
Mom was out the picture, and pops, I barely knew him
And I would pray to God but I'm tired of lying to him
Tired of tryna run from the things inside of us
Got a lot of fam and a lot of admirers
Who tell me that I should aspire to be changed
But when I think of changing, it's like, 'Why even try this shit?'
My mind hazy and my thoughts, they get distorted
I know my good and bad deeds both get recorded
You do right so your soul can last
But my role is cast before I even audition for it
So I don't really see an end to my vice
It's just false reformation, no end of my strife
Feel the evil overpowering, you can go ahead, throw the towel in
Cause nigga, that's the end of the fight
When you can only see the tunnel at the end of the light
Lights out, party over, it's the end of your life
And I'm out
Everything's changing around me
And I want to change too
It's one thing I know
It ain't cool being no fool
I feel different today
I don't know what else to say
But I'ma get my shit together
It's now or never
(Now or never, now or never)
(Now or never, now or never)

When I look into the mirror and see my own image
It feel like there's something else far in the distance
Something I wanna see, but something that's resistant
And every day, the haunting is growing more persistent
I never noticed it before, but now I can't miss it
And the constant pounding's driving me ballistic
I ran from it for years, but it's still next to me
And it's growing stronger, taking even less of me
I can't fight it now, I know it's just destiny
And I just wonder what's gon' happen when it catches me
Will it leave me face down in the Chesapeake?
Or will it just start bringing out the best in me?
But is the best in me really just the worst in me?
And if so, yesterday could be my anniversary
In sinner's court, sip port and have church with me
I'm trying to get rid of these ghosts that's cursing me
I'm feeling change is an absolute certainty
Cause what's going on is a state of emergency
Everything's changing around me
And I want to change too
It's one thing I know
It ain't cool being no fool
I feel different today
I don't know what else to say
But I'ma get my shit together
It's now or never
It's now or never6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Homicide or suicide, heads or tails
Some think life is a living hell
Some live life just living well
I live life tryna tip the scale my way
My way
My way
My way

Yo, I’m always early, I never take off
'Cause I've got a job: rob Peter to pay Paul
Now, I realize it’s the winner that takes all
Do what I gotta do because I can’t take loss
Picture me, living life as if I’m some animal
That consumes its own dreams, like I’m a cannibal
I won’t accept failure unless it’s mechanical
But still, the alcohol mixed with the botanical
I guess I be referred to the owners' manual full of loners
Full of all the homeless throwaways and the stoners
Soldiers of the streets, with eighth-grade diplomas
And the world awaiting their shoulders as a bonus
Look, let he without sin live without sin
Until then, I’ll be doing dirty jobs like swampmen
Counting the faces of those that I might've been
It’s like living that life, but I won’t live that life again
Homicide or suicide, heads or tails
Some think life is a living hell
Some live life just living well
I live life tryna tip the scale my way
My way
My way
My way

Lot of niggas go to prison—how many come out Malcolm X?
I know I'm not; shit, can't even talk about the rest
Famous last words: "You under arrest"
Will I get popped tonight? It's anybody's guess
I guess a nigga need to stay cunning
I guess when the cops coming, need to start running
I won't make the same mistakes from my last run-in
You either done doing crime now, or you done in
I got a brother on the run and one in
Wrote me a letter—he said, "When you coming?"
Shit, man, I thought the goal's to stay out
Back against the wall, then shoot your way out
Getting money's a style that never plays out
'Til you in a box, and your stash money’s paid out
The scales of justice ain't equally weighed out
Only two ways out: digging tunnels or digging graves out
Homicide or suicide, heads or tails
Some think life is a living hell
Some live life just living well
I live life tryna tip the scale my way
My way
My way
My way

First thing they teach you
Is not to give a fuck (Yeah, c'mon, man)

Someone has to care (Uh)
How I got over

Where the people come apart
Don't nobody care about you, only thing you got is God
Out here in these streets, if you get down on your luck
You can stand out with a hand out, but nobody give a fuck
Out here in these streets, every man is for himself
They ain't helping no one else, it's a hazard to your health
Living life in these cold streets
Hey—who's worrying 'bout you, babe?
When you wilding out? Running around in these streets?

Someone has to care (Yo)
When you on the corner, there's too much drama
Living with the police right behind you
It's always more than a slight reminder
We living in a war zone like Rwanda
Before I go back to the Heavenly Father
Pray for me, if it ain't too much bother
Whatever don't break me'll make me stronger
I feel like I can't take too much longer
It's too much lying and too much frying
I'm all cried out 'cause I grew up crying
They all got a sales pitch; I ain't buying
They trying to convince me that I ain't trying
We uninspired, we unadmired
And tired and sick of being sick and tired
Of living in the hood where the shots are fired
We dying to live; so, to live, we dying
You just like I am

Out on the streets (Ugh), where I grew up
How I got over
First thing they teach you is not to give a fuck
How I got over
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
Yo, somebody, somewhere
Someone has to care
Man, somebody's gotta care
And I swear it isn't fair
In suspended animation, we ain't tryna go nowhere
Out here in these streets, we're so young and all alone
We ain't even old enough to realize we're on our own
Living life in these hard streets, where it's like they lost they mind
Is there anyway to find? Are we running out of time out here?
Listen...
Hey—who's worrying 'bout you, babe?

"It’s about flesh and blood
It’s about a heart beat that beats strong
It’s about a passion that is unyielding
And I want you men to know today
It is your time
It is your hour, it is your moment
Go take it!"

Yeah, speaking of "Pieces of a Man"
Staring at a future in the creases of my hand
It reads like a final letter I’m leaving for my fam
But it’s written in language they will never understand
A late repentant, never deviating from a plan
I drive by, headed for the Valley of the Damned
The wheels spin, I’m looking for a sacrificial lamb
Then roll tactics like a soldier out in the Sudan
Listen: Was this a matter of flesh and blood? Yes, it was
Does it matter who win and lose? Yes, it does
It ain’t about the most blessed love
When you return to the essence, what is it back to the essence of?
Greatness, I wasn't in the presence of
'Cause you was fake and never measured up
You just a nigga on his regular, but how far am I ahead of you?
It just as easily could've been me instead of you
"We gon' fight 'til we can’t fight no more
And when we can’t fight no more
We gon' lie down and bleed a while
We gon’ get up, and fight some more
And I want you say it with me
Repeat it after me when I say it:
'We gon’ fight!'"

Fuck getting fucked, Immaculate Conception
Now, "What’s beef?" ain’t even a question
Calico kisses, cold blood, and crime tape
Flirt with death, every night is a blind date
One-night stand, payback's a bitch
Shit have you skinny-dipping in a pool of your piss
Blood, sweat, and tears, broken teeth and spit
Put the barrel in your mouth, blow the Devil a kiss
Put the knife in your back, cut down to the red meat
Daddy should’ve let me be a stain on the bedsheets
I’m one shot short of a Molotov cocktail
Kick in the door like, "Welcome to my world"
I’m an evil genius when it comes to this dumb shit
Half of the time, I'ma keep it one hundred
Don’t play chicken when I’m driving 'em crazy
Get hit in the wing, thigh, breast or drumstick
We like (We like— We like— We like— We like—)6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Dear God, I'm trying hard to reach you
Dear God, I see your face in all I do
Sometimes, it's so hard to believe in
But God, I know you have your reasons

Uh-huh, they said he's busy, hold the line please
Call me crazy, I thought maybe he could mind read
Who does the blind lead? Show me a sign please
If everything is made in China, are we Chinese?
And why do haters separate us like we siamese?
Technology turning the planet into zombies
Everybody all in everybody's dirty laundry
Acid rain, earthquakes, hurricane, tsunamis
Terrorists, crime sprees, assaults and robberies
Cops yelling "Stop freeze," shoot him 'fore he try to leave
Air quality so foul, I gotta try to breathe
Endangered species and we running out of trees
If I could hold the world in the palm of these hands
I would probably do away with these anomalies
Everybody checking for the new award nominees
Wars and atrocities, look at all the poverty
Ignoring the prophecies, more beef than broccoli
Corporate monopoly, weak world economy
Stock market toppling, mad marijuana
OxyContin and Klonopin, everybody out of it
Well I've been thinking about
And I've been breaking it down
Without an answer
I know I'm thinking out loud
But if your love's still around
Why do we suffer? Why do we suffer?

Uh-huh, yeah, it's still me, one of your biggest fans
I get off work, right back to work again
I probably need to go ahead and have my head exam
Look how they got me on the Def Jam payment plan
Well, I'm in the world of entertainment and
Tryna keep a singing man sane for the paying fans
If I don't make it through the night, slight change of plans
Harp strings, angel wings and praying hands
Lord, forgive me for my shortcomings
For going on tour and ignoring the court summons
All I'm tryna do is live life to the fullest
They sent my daddy to you in a barrage of bullets
Why is the world ugly when you made it in your image?
And why is living life such a fight to the finish?
For this high percentage, when the sky's the limit
A second is a minute, every hour's infinite
Dear God, I'm trying hard to reach you
Dear God, I see your face in all I do
Sometimes, it's so hard to believe in4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We go wow, ba-da-da-dow-da-dah-dow
Either stand tall, or just sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down
(Runnin one-on-one, the only hip-hop band)
Yo Tariq (Whassup?) How your microphone sound?
(It sound tight) Well aight, show 'em what it's about
We got to blow up the spot because they must have forget
We double (Trouble) bubble (Bubble) bubble, bubblin' hot

Well it's like, smack the track up and leave dents in it
The vocalist, busting this blunt, instrument spit
The magnificent, rappers run from it
All fly girls' nipples and toes numb from it
MC's in my circumference, is confronted son
Get your growth stunted from this, you don't want it
(What nigga?) The Black Thought and M-O-S Def done it
Who the ultimate? Yo my man speak upon it
Ayo, I stop fools and drop jewels but never run it
Rock mics so nice, I make you stock price plummet
All you high noon riders better rally at the summit
It's me and Tariq and your fleet outnumbered
Cross the membrane, barking big game and get hunted
Eye witness account, say it happened so sudden
Just slid off to the side, didn't really say nuttin
Then BLAOW, blew away the 1900th
You better get your rest cause the next day comin
Oh yes, and MCs, they scared to say sum'tin
Stop frontin, I'm in the cut just onlookin
Your get your kings, your rooks, rings and pawns tooken
Ayo, keep your tape rolling so you catch every bar
Of the Black Thought and the black man from Black Star
Illadelph and Vietnam, we conference, accomplish
Even with stakes inclined, I get mine regardless
Yo, a lot of Smurfette MCs carry purses
And rock uniforms that's made for nurses
I burst your verses, your words is worthless
Only touching surface, the fuck's the purpose?
I shot the sherriff, the deputy, and head of bank treasury
So mounties in the county got a big bounty stressin me
But tell 'em to hold off, they too short to measure me
Mos and Black Thought blast forth with the weaponry
Like blaow-ba-dow-da-da-dow-da-dah-dow
Either stand tall or sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down

We got to blow up the spot because they must have forget
We double (Trouble) bubble (Bubble) bubble, bubblin' hot

Yeah, now check your stove top before you take a listen
And make sure beans don't burn in the kitchen
These gassed-up niggas just ain't fuel efficient
I play the winter breeze to choke hold your piston
Now you niggas can't make pole position
Class E chassis can't hold the transmission
Crew pit useless, they got they tools missing
Watch me, Grand Prix, champy for wealth driven
Yo, you go one for my hustle (Ha!) two to rock rhyme
From the muscle kid I'm one of the illest of all time
I swing from chandeliers and wall climb
And specialize in warfares of all kind
A lot of MCs said I'm a run it down rhyme
But half the time, they running down one of mine
Thought suffocating 'em with yet another stunning line
You dumb and blind kid, it's enlarged and underlined
What I memorized leave your whole staff pressurized
Melt down all of your artificial lies
Y'all niggas is faker than Yellow No. 5
Swine like mono and diglyceride
My vocals got texture, you just texturized
I'm nicer than your writtens even when I'm improvised
Step into my zone get flown like fly
By the b-boy Lazarus who just won't die
Yo, me and Kamal and Leonard Hubbard, Questlove and Malik
We go back to dollar hoagies and Tahitian Treat
Or like toast in the oven with government cheese bubbling
Me and Dante like Marvin, the trouble men travelling
Give me the mic, we on that again
B-boy business, off the top acting and battling
Serving them cats that forgot
But don't get too close because you might get shot
Like blaow-ba-dow-da-da-dow-da-dah-dow
Either stand tall or sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down
Yo Tariq (Whassup?) How your microphone sound?
(It sound tight) Well aight, show 'em what it's about
We got to blow up the spot because they must have forget
We double (Trouble) bubble (Bubble) bubble, bubblin' hot
We go blaow-ba-dow-da-da-dow-da-dah-dow
Either stand tall or sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Went from Do You Want More?!??!! to what you want now?
Yo Tariq (Whattup?) Well how your microphone sound?
(It sound tight) Well aight, show 'em what it's about
We got to blow up the spot because they must have forget
We double (Trouble) bubble (Bubble) bubble, bubblin' hot

Say here's a little story that must be told
About two young brothers who got so much soul
They taking total control, of the body and brain
Flying high in the sky on a lyrical plane
It's just two bad brothers who will never quit
Mos Def and Tariq from the 2-1-5th
They rock beginning to end, on a spiritual blend
And everybody who forgot then baby tell 'em again
It's just me and Tariq, with Ahmir on the beat
The Roots crew baby, yo, we got to make it unique
We got the soul-shockinest, body-rockinest
Non-stoppinest, Fortified Live survive the apocalypse
Rhymes we say, the perfect blend
Because we know how to rock when the beat come in
Like zen-zen-zen-zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen-zen-zen, zen-zen, zen-zen
Zen zen-zen, ZEN zen zen ZEN zen zen
Zen zen, ZEN zen zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen, ZEN zen ZEN zen
Here we go, here we, here we, here we go
Zen zen-zen, ZEN zen zen ZEN zen zen
Zen zen, ZEN zen zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen-zen-zen, zen-zen, zen-zen
Let the poppers pop, and the breakers break
Then zen-zen-zen-zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen-zen-zen, zen-zen, zen-zen
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Zen zen, ZEN zen, zen-zen zen-zen
Zen zen zen zen zen zen zen
And these are the zen zen zen zen6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
