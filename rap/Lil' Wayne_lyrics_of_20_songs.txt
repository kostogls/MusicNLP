I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, and when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit, and when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it

I be with bitches that be with bitches that be with niggas with riches
I tell her, "Get him," she say, "I got you," I say, "No, bitch, I said get him"
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs, it's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly, I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say? Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin' your business, she tell me your business, you tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin', to you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide it tell me where it's hidden, she know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics, and meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains, we find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checkin', then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothin', keep restin'," she say, "What's missin'?" "How you know somethin' missin'?"
He scratch his head, she say, "Get back in bed," and she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say, "Ooh"
I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches that's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, "Don't be so obvious!"
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell, she bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, "Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place," and if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware, she don't want love, she just want her share

I know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears, and then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him, and then I call Liz, and she say he comin' over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told you," she gave me the salute, I say, "Girl, you're a soldier"
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up, walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked, they started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch, music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out of him, piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
"Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up, Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down"
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her, she a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after, if Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga, but think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga, I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drank on me, nigga, she slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture, Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga, you fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everythin' that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion, we have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga, now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga, but she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (Mona)
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup and a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh, probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa) Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it, make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi? Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the mornin' to The Great Gatsby, then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughin', I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy, Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy, bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me 'bout a motherfuckin' double standard, actin'
Fuckin' on another nigga, that's a negative alone, but you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No) You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick) (… lick me like a lollipop)
He on your fuckin' ringtone? Is that the shit that you do? Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews, I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder, forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma, daycare after school and she never did charge you
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up, you know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin', goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress, I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy, I'm killin' myself
She say, "Ooh, Daddy, ooh," Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (Ooh), Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, "Ooh," no emotion (Ooh), Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah193EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration

I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: "Ha-ha-ha-ha

I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say "Life ain't shit without me"
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, ‘cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me

Young Money!
Yeah
Four
Ahem!

I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will, ugh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will (Ugh)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will
Yeah

I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for me!"
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that "whine 'n' dine"
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, "Choose wisely," that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel (I feel like the sky is opening, and I am entering)
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
(Feel like like the world is falling and I am rising)
'cause she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will
Carter 4 Tunechi
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now

Yeah

Don't cry, don’t go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah

Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads: "Don’t cry, stay tuned."
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry), don’t go (Why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry, don't cry)
I fuckin' love you, woah (Don't cry, don't cry)

Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, "dun-dun-dun-dun-dun"
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, "It's just you and I"
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry), I fuckin' love you, woah
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah (Don't cry)

Don't cry, stay tuned
And triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradise138EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah, I put my shades on

I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

Stunna, I got 'em, I'm back on them bitches
All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting
Eastside, MOB Piru Damu

I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'

With my teeth glowing, I'm on my Deebowin'
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?
Motherfucker ask me why, I say YM
Beach bum, call me Ocean Drive Slim
Drop the top, look up and make the sky grin
Young Mula, skinnies and some Supras
Belly of the beast 'til it puke us, motherfucker

Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused

We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole

And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand

You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me

Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments

Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
You a roughneck, I'm a cutthroat
You're a tough  guy, that's enough jokes
Then the sun die, the night is young though
The diamonds still shine in the rough, ho
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, where the ones go?
It's a shit show, put you front row
Talkin' shit, bro? Let your tongue show
Money over bitches, and above hoes
That is still my favorite love quote
Put the gun inside, what the fuck for?
I sleep with the gun, and she don't snore
What the fuck, yo? Where the love go?
Trade the ski mask for the muzzle
It's a blood bath, where the suds go?
It's a Swizz beat, there the drums go
If she's iffy, there the drugs go
If she sip lean, double-cup toast
I got a duffle full of hundos
There the love go, where's the uproar?
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro

Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
I come out the scuffle without a scuff, woah
Puff, puff, bro; I don't huff though
Yellow diamonds up close, catch a sunstroke
At your front door with a gun stowed
"Knock, knock. Who's there?" is how it won't go
This the jungle, so have the utmost
For the nutzos, and we nuts, so
What the fuck, bro? It's where I'm from, bro
We grow up fast, we roll up slow
We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope
Dreadlock hang down like you dun know
Put the green in the bag like a lawnmower
Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow
Extra clip in the stash like a console
Listenin' to Bono, you listen to Donald
What the fuck, bro? Where the love go?
Swizzy, he the chef, I like my lunch gross
Just look up, bro, there the Scuds go
I see the shovel, but where did bruh go?
Hmm, to the unknown
Only way he comin' back is through his unborns
If you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord
It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go

I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, ma'fucker
‘Cause all this bullshit just made me strong, ma'fucker

So I pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

Uh
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I, I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside
So I could pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Haha, yeah
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone
I'm gone

It hurts, but I never show, this pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove I just stand up and scream: "Fuck 'em all!"

Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in
Oops, time to raise it then, your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy, this crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes, I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time and I
Came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up, fuck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim, but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another, I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod, I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie, permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk, you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'—
Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah

How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and them crooks still crook

You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

See, I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love, yeah
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love97EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

No homo (Young Mula, baby!)
I say, he's so sweet, make her wanna lick the wrapper
Remix, baby!

Lollipop, lollipop, breastses just like Dolly Parton
She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot
'Til she ask, "How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take" 'til she get to shop?
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze
Tell a girl, "Like Doritos, that's not 'cho cheese"
Tell her friends, "Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to lay"
I can't only have one, and I ain't trying to wait
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gon' melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man, I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold, chicken soup won't help
We need four more hoes, we need oh, oh, oh, oh!
You know what it is when we out of town
We balling too serious, and you out of bounds
So come here, baby girl
You're now fucking with the best in the world
Lollipop
The best in the world
Sh-Sh-She lick me like a lollipop
World, world
She— She lick me like a lollipop

Shawty want a thug, thug, thug
Bottles in the club, club, club (Bottles in the club)
Shawty wanna hump (Shawty wanna)
You know I like to touch (Shawty wanna)
Your lovely lady lumps, lumps, lumps (Shawty wanna)
Shawty want a thug (I like that)
Bottles in the club (Hey, I like that)
Shawty wanna hump (I like that, haha!)
You know I like to touch your lovely lady lumps, lumps, lumps

Shawty say she wanna lick the wrapper
And she gonna lick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno-flicking actor
I Anita-bake her; now, she caught up in that "Rapture"
I got so much chips, I swear, they call me "Hewlett Packard"
I got so much chips, you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy mother-fudge cake; now, tell me how that fudge tastes
I do it for Bloods' sake—soo-woo!
Think it's voodoo how that roof do di-di-dissipate
Your girl want to participate
She so, so sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then, my diamonds are in the choir because they sing from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang because all she do is bang
Like Ricky Martin; Wayne and Kanye: pick your poison
If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment with Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it—remix!
Shawty want a thug, thug, thug (Shawty want a thug, yeah!)
Bottles in the club, club, club (Bottles in the club, yeah!)

Shawty want a thug (I like that)
Bottles in the club (Hey, I like that)
Shawty wanna hump (I like that, haha!)
You know I like to touch your lovely lady lumps, lumps, lumps

Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I've flushed out the feeling of me being the shit
'Cause I was leaving skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it, like Hide-and-Go
And I can go anywhere: eeny, mini, miney, mo
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD-thing, tapedeck
​iPod, your girlfriend, and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex
'Cause you don't want that late text, that "I think I'm late" text
Haha! So wrap it up!
Bu-Bu-But he's so sweet, sh-she wanna lick the wrapper

Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club, club, club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps, lumps, lumps (Re-Re-Re-Remix, baby!)
Lick me like a lollipop (Lollipop)
She— She lick me like a lollipop (L-Lollipop)

Like colossal
Like, you know what I mean, like (sighs)
I heard you were lookin' for me

Hey, Mr. Carter (Hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Haha, you know, hehe)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (I know, haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hey, hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Shit, you know)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Hahahah)

Yeah, to you forever, from me to you
I heard somebody say "Church!" I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him!)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world and I'm back again!
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin', hah!)

Yeah, I been in and out the bank, bitch
While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: "Wayne quit!?"
Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call 'em April babies, cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream "Soo-woo" and "Da-da-doe"
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care
Hey, Mr. Carter (Young! I am him)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again

I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share, mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!
It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, "What up, killa?" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, Baby!

Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Yeah)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Hova!)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Weezy)
They've been wondering why (Baby!)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hahaha)
Tell me, where have you been? (I been hustlin')
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Hustlin' hard)
They've been wondering why (Chyeah!)
Hey, Mr. Carter
Tell me, where have you been?
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why
And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Fine, we'll lose two lives; yours and mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve66EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Billion dollar smile, I sell myself short if I grin, I'm bargainin' then
Apartments and shit, I could park in this shit in the foreign car that I could talk to and shit
With a cultural bitch I can talk to and shit 'bout the culture and shit, how I altered this shit
