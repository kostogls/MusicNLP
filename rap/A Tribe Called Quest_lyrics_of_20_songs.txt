We don't believe you 'cause we the people
Are still here in the rear, ayo, we don't need you
You in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood
When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back
She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that
The doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with
VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas
Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl
Gentrify here, now it's not a shit hole
Trendsetter, I know, my shit's cold
Ain't settling because I ain't so bold but ay

All you Black folks, you must go
All you Mexicans, you must go
And all you poor folks, you must go
Muslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways
So all you bad folks, you must go
The fog and the smog of news media that logs
False narratives of Gods that came up against the odds
We're not just nigga rappers with the bars
It's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars

You bastards overlooking street art
Better yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians
Fuck y'all know about true competition?
That's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin'
The only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin'
We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten
Dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division
Boy, I tell you that's vision
Like Tony Romo when he hitting Witten
The Tribe be the best in they division
Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision
Who can come back years later, still hit the shot?
Still them tryna move we off the fucking block
Babylon, bloodclaat
Two pon yuh headtop

All you Black folks, you must go
All you Mexicans, you must go
And all you poor folks, you must go
Muslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways
So all you bad folks, you must go49EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Street poetry is my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was working at the club, you would not pay
Ayo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say

I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now, let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little something on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talking 'bout you
Yo, I took you out
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
But I couldn't drop dimes 'cause you couldn't relate
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down (You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down (You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down

Stretch out your legs, let me make you bawl
Drive you insane, drive you up the wall
Staring at your dome-piece, very strong
Stronger than pride, stronger than Teflon
Take you on the ave and you buy me links
Now I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy

Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood
But hon, you got the goods, like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik, the Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week
She simply said, "No", labelled me a ho
I said, "How you figure?" "My friends told me so"
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep in my Jeep
Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet
See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets

If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl, I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture

Shaheed, Phife and the Extra P
Stacy Beadle, PJ and my man LG
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice
The character is of men, never ever of mice
Shorty, let me tell you 'bout my only vice
It has to do with lots of loving and it ain't nothing nice

Relax yourself, girl, please settle down (It ain't nothing nice)
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down (It ain't nothing nice)

Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?

A-yo, Bo knows this (What?) And Bo knows that (What?)
But Bo don't know jack, 'cause Bo can't rap
Well, what do you know? The Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move-fakin'
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so
Sleep if you want, Nytol will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some; short, dark, and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fumin', I've had it up to here
My days of payin' dues are over, acknowledge me as in there
(Yeah!) Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meanin' from the get-go
Sit back, relax, and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know
Yes, yes, y'all! (Yes, y'all!)
Who got the vibe? It's the Tribe, y'all! (Tribe, y'all!)
Real live, y'all! (Live, y'all!)
Inside, outside, come arooound
(Who's that?) Brooooown!
So, may I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb, and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve, rotate the gates (Contact!)
Can I get a hit? (Hit!) Boom bip
With a brother named Tip, and we're ready to flip
East coast stompin', rippin', and rompin'
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out!
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow-how-now-wow, how now, Brown cow?
We're ill 'til the skill gets down for the flex, next!
It's the textbook, old to the new, but the rest are doo-doo
From radio, to the video, to Arsenio
Tell me, yo; what's the scenario?

(True, blue!) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the s'mores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape, crushed grapes, apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an (L-ah-!), an (-eader!), simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace, see ya later
Later (Later!) Later, alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the urge to inflate her
So, yo, the D, what! The O
Incorporated I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped, flat back, first this, foul, fight, fight, fight, laugh
Yo, how'd that sound? (Ooooh!)
It's a Leader-Quest mission and we got the goods here (Here!)
Never on the left, 'cause my right's my good ear (Ear!)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime, so I ain't no (criminal!)
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test the water, little kid
Yo, Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell 'em what I did—
—I heard you rushed and rushed (and attacked!)
Then they rebuked and you (had to smack!)
Causin' rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear—
—You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on a played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario:

Watch; as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come, rewind
Powerful impact (Boom!) from the cannon!
Not braggin', tryna read my mind, just imagine
Vo-cab-u-lary's necessary, when diggin' into my library
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Eatin' Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Unh! Unh! Unh! All over the track, man
Unh, pardon me, unh! As I come back!
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town, I roll with the squadron
Rawr! Rawr! Like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers 'cause your pants are saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smellin' rank like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kickin'
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (Unh!), the rhymes are on time (Time!)
Rippin' up the sound just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Yeah, my man, mothafucka!
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo

Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove
(Can I kick it?)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)

Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

Can I kick it? To my Tribe that flows in layers
Right now, Phife is a poem sayer
At times, I'm a studio conveyor
Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major
Yes, the Tribe of the game we're the player
As you inhale like a breath of fresh air

Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, check the rhyme

Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I, The Abstract
And me, the Five Footer
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter
Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?
Um... um... a tidbit, um... a smidgen
I don't get the message so you gots to run the pigeon
Heh, okay, you on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
You on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
You on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
Well, then grab the microphone and let your words rip

Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack, that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that Buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On top remaining, no home training 'cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt, the Jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive, I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm, yeah, that's what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, play tapes y'all
Check the rhyme y'all, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out

Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I, the Phifer And me, the Abstract
The rhymes were so rumpin' that the brothers rode the 'zack
Aiyo Tip, do you recall when we used to rock What?
Those fly routines on your cousin's block?
Um, let me see... damn, I can't remember
I receive the message and you will play the sender
You on point Tip? All the time, Phife
You on point Tip? Yeah, all the time, Phife
You on point Tip? Yo, all the time, Phife
So play the resurrector and give the dead some life

Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed, I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must you go to gain respect? Umm...
Well, it's kinda simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy, sad and alone
Industry rule number four-thousand-and-eighty;
Record company people are shady
So kids, watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it, look at how they act
Well, off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll score 'em with decorum
And proper—what you say, Hammer? Proper
Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop
NC, y'all check the rhyme y'all
SC, y'all check it out y'all
Virginia, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out, check it out
In London, check the rhyme, y'all57EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity, never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
I never half step cause I'm not a half stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed
So won't you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out

Zulu Nation, brothers last creation
Minds get flooded, ejaculation
Right on the two inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across, so bust, the floss
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm
As I crack the, monotone
Children of the jazz so, get your own
Smokin R&B cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
For it's Abstract, original
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

Yo when you bug out
You usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding, always surrounding
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding
You don't really fret, you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind
But people seem to take that, as being unkind
"Oh yo he's acting stank," really on a regal?
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug
If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged
Yo, I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road, see, I was Boulevard status
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world?
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause you're feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
It's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out

Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz

Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound
Captivate the mass, cause the prose was profound
Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
Or your Honda, or your Bimmer, or your Legend, or your Benz
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends
So push it, along, trails, we blaze
Don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise
The tranquility will make you unball your fist
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist
A brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
So low-key that you probably missed it
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
When the guy takes the beat, they bowed
So raise up squire, adjust your attire
We have no time to wallow in the mire
If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed
Then cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk
I don't really mind if it's over your head
Cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
So pay attention, it's not hard to decipher
And after the horns, you can check out the Phifer
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz

Competition dem try fe come side way
But competition they must come straight way
Competition dem try fe come side way
But competition they must come straight way
How's about that, it seems like it's my turn again
All through the years my mic has been my best friend
I know some brothers wonder, can Phife really kick it?
Some even wanna diss me, but why sweat it?
I'm all into my music cos it's how I make papes
Try to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes
Me sweat another? I do my own thing
Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing
I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks
Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks
I sing, and chat, I do all of that
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack
I take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock
But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop
I got Tip and Shah (huh), so whom shall I fear? (Word)
Stop look and listen, but please don't stare (uh)
So jet to the store, and buy the LP (yeah)
On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's
Produced and arranged (huh?) by the four-man crew
And oh shit, Skeff Anselm, he gets props too (ha-ha)
Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers (Yeah)
So the new shit can rock (uh), from Bronx to Massapequa (uh)
Cause where I come from quality is job one
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done
So peace to that crew (yeah), and peace to this crew (Yeah)
Bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you
Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut
Back and forth just like a Cameo song
If you dig this joint then please come dance along
To the music cause it's done just for the rhyme
Now I gotta scat and get mine, underline
The jazz, the what? The jazz can move that ass
Cause the Tribe originates that feeling of pizazz
It's the universal sound, bless the brothers on the ground
And the ones six below, you didn't have to go
Some say that I'm eccentric cause I once had an orgy
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies
If this is a stinker, then call me a skunk, I ask
("What's, wrong?") Now check it out

All my peoples in Queens ya don't stop
Now all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop
And all my peoples uptown ya don't stop
That includes the Bronx and Harlem ya don't stop
Now to that girl Ramelle ya don't stop
I said because Ladies First ya don't stop
And to the JB's, ya don't stop
And De La Soul, ya don't stop
To my Brand Nubians ya don't stop
And to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop
To my man Large Professor ya don't stop
Pete Rock for the beat ya don't stop
Everybody in the place ya don't stop
You keep it on, to the rhythm, ya don't stop

We’ve got to get our shit together

It’s time to go left and not right
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformists, one hitter quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let’s get it together, come on let’s make it
Gotta make it to make it, to make it, to make it, to make it
To make something happen, to make something happen
To make something happen, let’s make something happen

And we grip our balls every time we stuntin' on tour
'Cause we never bore, responding to the ready crowd's roar
And promoters try to hit us with the art of war
We about our business, we not quitters
Not bullshitters, we deliver—we go-get it
Don’t be bitter 'cause we not just niggas
Jarobi, my fiber wove into different cloth
Ain’t nothing forbidden, this nigga get his written off
Hardest spit in the city y’all niggas spitting kitten soft
Confused and amazed, shook up with your brain missing lost
They planning for our future, people
None of our people involved
Pouring Henny and Smirnoff to get it cracking off
Cracking off a Smirnoff to quickly turn to Molotov
Molotov the spaceship doors before that bitch is taking off
It always seems the poorest persons
Are people forsaken, dawg
No Washingtons, Jeffersons, Jacksons
On the captain's log
They’d rather lead us to the grayest water poison deadly smog
Mass un-blackening, it’s happening, you feel it y’all?
Rather see we in a three-by-three structure with many bars
Leave us where we are so they can play among the stars
They taking off to Mars, got the space vessels overflowing
What, you think they want us there? All us niggas not going
Reputation ain’t glowing, reparations ain’t flowing
If you find yourself stuck in a creek, you better start rowing
Used to see the TV screen as the place to land my dream in
And the car stereo where they would promote the show
Optimistic little brother with a hope you know
(Move on to the stars)
There ain’t a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck here, nigga
(Move on to the stars)
There ain’t a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck here nigga
(Move on to the stars)
There ain’t a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck here, nigga
(Move on to the stars)
There ain’t a space program for niggas
Yeah, you stuck, stuck, stuck
(Move on to the stars)

Sit and wonder sometimes, I read the paper every day
All these happenings is cycular, just happen different ways
And the president's refined, in her wing she's confined
With about thirty Percocets and five bottles of wine
Carolina nothing finer than a Black woman who climbs
To the top of the State building claiming that that flag is mine
Now, people on top of people, feels like we can’t breathe
Put so much in this muthafucka, feel like we shouldn't leave
Put it on TV, put it in movies, put it in our face
These notions and ideas and citizens live in space
I chuckle just like all of y'all, absurdity, after all
Takes money to get it running and money for trees to fall
Imagine for one second all the people are colored, please
Imagine for one second all the people in poverty
No matter the skin tone, culture or time zone
Think the ones who got it
Would even think to throw you a bone?
Moved you out your neighbourhood, did they find you a home?
Nah cypher, probably no place to
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude
Time to go left and not right
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformers, won’t hear the quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Let’s make somethin' happen, let’s make somethin' happen
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformists, one-hitter quitters

The danger must be growing
For the rowers keep on rowing
And they’re certainly not showing
Any signs that they are slowing!
"We’re there!"
"Where?"
"Here!"
A small step for mankind
But a giant step for us
Oompa, loompa, doopa dee doo
I’ve got another puzzle for you31EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
New York, NJ, NC, VA
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Oaktown, LA, San Fran, St. John

People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and your concubines
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies act like gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J.B.'s on "The Promo"
In my never-ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second son, 'cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do that, that, that (come on)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that (OK)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that
I'm bugging out but let me get back 'cause I'm wetting niggas
So run and tell the others 'cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas

Back in '89 I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
SC, Maryland, New Orleans, Motown
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
New York, NJ, NC, VA

Seven times out of ten we listen to our music at night, thus spawned the title of this program
The word, maraud, means to loot
In this case, we maraud for ears44EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Handle rocks with the capital G, ball on the beat
Status, Chris Paul and John Wall in the league
Grabbin' mics till the knuckles would bleed
('Cause I believe
The potent that I'm quoting will have you geeked like speed)
If rationale is naturale or a weave
It's all edges and peas
Settin' press, we on a permanent steeze
I'm in a world where my princess is Leia
And she's feeling my Vader
And my lure grows greater and greater
Chem trails, droppin' poisonous vapors
Have you shaking like Gator
Been trill, nigga, process the data
Blu-ray, wave file, or a Beta, I'll DVR it for later
Kappo Masa with a G to my waiter
You can't define us, XY us, or Z us
You generational elitists
Have your chi in virtual think pieces
(See, these written words are poetical science
Brain's defiant, thoughts heavy, baby
They're a major appliance)Leave a dent when drop with the flyness, fluent giant
Dude's nice, he tight, screwed in with some pliers
Cool with some buyers
Yeah, nigga, cool with some growers
(Never no tattletales, only I don't knowers)
We a show me generation, show us what you gon' show us
So listen, mami, see we could collude with a boing
Mouthpiece like Goines, with a jubilant noise
Dudes rude and as useless as coins, shoot 'em boys
Versed in, rehearsed in the soothing of loins
Talk to Joey, Earl, Kendrick, and Cole, gatekeepers of flow
They are extensions of instinctual soulIt's the highest in commodity grade
And you could get it today
Dis generation, dis generation, dis generation
Dis generation, dis generation, dis generation
Rules di nation

One hitting reading pages of Poe
Telly is low, cuddle bunny ready to go
Day of the dead
Bury all the zombies instead
And it's just your aftermath, Busta cuttin' your dreads
Bruce Leein' niggas, while you niggas UFC
Smoke tree on niggas, sizzle out your USB
(Surge pricing on these Ubers, I'mma get me a cab)
Yo, where Jarobi at?
Imbibing on impeccable grass
I be in NYC waiting for that law to pass
(Pass shit, been waiting for a Jet's title since last
Richard Todd, Todd Bowles, gang green on that ass)
Magic Mike on the mic, David Blaine, Douglass Henning
In the church of Busta Rhymes, it's my sermon you're getting
Horizontal spittin', I'm the exorcist of your writtens
Don't interrupt me, nigga, sorry, that's a sin unforgivenLike how we be skipping on beats like cooking crack in the kitchen
B-b-b-b-b-b-but wait
Just spit the package, dry it, bag up the wet
This mad city's not a game, easy, quiet on set, Phife
(Student of the past trailblazing a daze
Not acknowledging a trend or swept up in a phase
We still the highest of commodity grade
And you could get it, get it, get it, get it today)
Dis generation, dis generation, dis generation
Dis generation, dis generation, dis generation
Rules di nation

This is our generation, generation, uh huh, yeah

Back in the days when I was a teenager
Before I had status and before I had a pager
You could find the Abstract listenin' to hip-hop
My pops used to say, it reminded him of Bebop
I said, "Well, Daddy, don't you know that things go in cycles?
Way that Bobby Brown is just amping like Michael"
It's all expected, things are for the lookin'
If you got the money, Quest is for the bookin'
Come on everybody, let's get with the fly mode
Still got room on the truckload of black boom
Listen to the rhymes, then get a mental picture
Of this black man, and black woman fixture
Why do I say that? 'Cause I gotta speak the truth, man
Doin' what we feel for the music is the proof, and
Planted on the ground, the act is so together
Bona fide strong, you need leverage to sever
The unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is
Delivering each year an LP filled with street goods
You can find it on your rack in your record store
If you get the record, say your thoughts are adored
And appreciated, 'cause we're ever so glad we made it
We work hard, so we gotta thank God
Dishin' out the plastic, do the dance till you're spastic
If you diss—it gets drastic
Listen to the rhyme, 'cause it's time to make gravy
If it moves your booty, then shake, shake it, baby
All the way to Africa, A.K.A. the Motherland
Stick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand
That's the right hand, Black man
Only if you are noted as my man
If I get the credit, then I think I deserve it
If you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it
Get in the zone of positivity, not negativity
'Cause we gotta strive for longevity
If you botch up, what's in that 
(What?) A pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half
We gotta make moves (words)
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves (words)
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

"Time, time is a ship on a merciless sea
Drifting toward an abyss of nothingness
Until it can be recharted for its own destiny
Time is an inanimate object paying and paying and paying for no justification for belief
Time is dancing, boogalooing-away all memories of past—"

We gotta be a winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a hip-hop crime
With the dope raps and dope tracks we move blocks
From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
Musically the Quest, is on the rise
We on these excursions so you must realize
That continually, I pop my Zulu 
If you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip
So what can you do in the times which exist
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
But if your sis is a , brother is a jerk
Leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
Whatever it may be in today's society
Everything is fair, least that's how it seems to me
You must be honest and true to the next
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex
Especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen
Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend
All it is, is the code of the streets
So listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats
Beats that are hard, beats that are funky
They could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
What you gotta do is know the Tribe is in the sphere
The Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare
(Or Edgar Allan Poe, or Langston Hughes, or...)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

"—time is running out on black power advocates in the day and white thighed supporters at night
Every time you see them, they're chasin' some white woman with their tongue hangin' out
Time is running and passing, passing and running, running and passing, passing and running—"

Just done mash a show, Dawg is off on sabbatical
Rather watch the Nixon shit than politicians politic
CNN and all this shit, gwaan yo, move with the fuckery
Trump and the SNL hilarity
Troublesome times kid, no times for comedy
Blood clot, you doing, bullshit you spewing
As if this country ain't already ruined
In lieu of these mumbling, fumbling
Swearing they're the greatest
Online they debate us, if we different, then we're haters
We ended our hiatus, the dogs looking for food
The nucleus is here now (ooo)

Toleration for devastation, got a hunger for sin
Every nation Obama nation, let the coroner in
Crooked faces, red and blue laces for the color of men
Just embrace it and die alone, song of Revelation
Reverends and cattles racing
Devils and demons and Deuteronomy
Fumigate our economy, 'lluminate broken dreams
And manifest all insanity, look around
Sayonara tomorrow, it's just blood on the ground

Aiyo, put one up for the Phifer, long time no hear from
Suckers walkin' around talkin' about they could get some
But that vibe is non-cypher, no can do
And if you take I fi' joke, then ask the other two
And I proceed to let you know, exactly how to flow
I'm not Lawn Doctor so just seckle with the hoe
Oops... my mistake, I didn't know you went with her
Should I run down the line of all the kids that done hit her?
Don't be bitter, I hear that honey resembles a critter
Heard she likes the two-on-one like my man John Ritter
But back to the subject, you can't catch wreck
You must get respect, to earn respect
Suckers think they could hurt me, 'cause now I wear specs
You're full of jokes, but yo, your name ain't Flex
I got the riches, the bitches, I'm large like a Huxtable
You think you're all that, but your girl's quite doable!
Yeah, I'm tellin' you G, to back up off me
I’m not a man called Hawk, but I ain’t Mr. Softee
Rappin' is an art comin' straight from the heart
So forget the chart because the action can start
Hot sex on a platter
Hot sex on a platter
Hot sex on a platter
Hot sex on a platter
Hot sex on a platter
Hot sex on a platter

Uh ha... where ya at? To all my people with the funk
I'm the undercover brother, dump your hoe in the trunk
Save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers
Niggas, step back, it's the lyrical worker
The poems that I create ain't in paperback books
The poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks
My mental is excellin' 'cause I dabble in the books
I'm not the one to front on, so suboops-suboops
Yo, I gets the pickin's, I'm such a damn Dickens
If you step to this then the plot just thickens
I'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog
To me, your just another MC on the log
A link in the chain, fluid on the brain
I boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mundane
See, I can't maintain, especially if you come back
I'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah, I could do that
I could also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home
'Cause when I get done, I'll have her strung on bones
It's the no-joke pressure that elevates my mind
Make me pick up and go when it's time to drop my rhymes
My title is rock, the Abstract Poetic
I'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic
So smooth and debonair, special for the ear
Gotta keep my thing in gear
'Cause it's evident and clear that I will rock, rock, rock...

If you wanna take it further your Huckleberry is here

I ain't even gon' lie, I was probably high
Just forgot to call you back, simple as that
I ain't no almanac, so lick my dictionary
I might just call a cab 'cause I dig canary
Yellow accents on a dark bitch
I met her back when she kept all her carpet
I'm well aware all that shit is fantasy
I double dare y'all to fuck your plan B
That's demeanor, momma's mannerisms
That mean, don't mean to get vulgar, but it's some
Hoes in this bitch like a box of donuts
It's cold out in this bitch, standing on the corner
Condolences to niggas that got erased
I pour out some liquor on a cop's grave
Mmm, digital church bells
Ringin' 'cross the street, sure work well

(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?
(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?

(Kids) For real (For real?) For real (For real)
I don't wanna get up now, I don't wanna go to school
I don't wanna be the best, don't wanna follow rules
Mom, I think you fuckin' lied to me
Three stacks said all this shit is fantasy
It's my time, gon' put a little life to it
If life's a obstacle then I'mma bike through it
I see it like a kiddie on the carousel
If I 'url while I go around, what the hell
And that went well, so I'm compelled
To have visions of getting chicken while my friends get jel
My young nigga motto was, "Fuck it, I'm already grown"
And I dream of when I'm sixteen, I'm out my home
That petty though, 'cause my mama boyfriend dough
It's kinda long like this old head hustle, yo
He cognizant of a nigga ride and die
I see us getting money through my green eyes

(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?
(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?

Yeah, all the kids, all the what, uh
Yeah, all the badass kids, uh
Kids, say I'm the shit
I'm Chick-fil-A nuggets, McDonald's french fries
The spicy Popeye's and Red Lobster biscuits
And girls scout thin mints
Pardon my penmanship, but oh shit
Feel like I'm hungry now again
And I can't do nothing about it because my teeth are all rotted
And my mom and my pop, they just grin
And empathize with me 'cause they were little like Pygmies
But too bad they can't get back they 'member whens
Them grown-up stories don't work
In the court of the kiddies', the judgement is in
And while y'all doing all y'all your bids, y'all reminisce as kids
Fuck it, kids, the grown-ups won't own up
They stood on the corner
Like you once upon a, time
And probably felt like a loner
And smelled like a stoner, and snuck to Daytona
So when they questioning you 'bout who or who you ain't boning
Complaining that you always moaning
Never saying good morning
Storming out my house
And slamming doors like you paying bills
They been through it too, though
They were kids like you, though
But what if they knew though
And hit you with the cheat code
To a game you just start playing, no extra man
Leave you reckless on the court
With no high percentage shot
Just a bunch of, "You got 'em, nigga, just give it what you got"
Yeah, it look a little different on a yacht
But ain't gon' lie, I miss kayaking
I love the young niggas, and they do too, they just be acting
Like a bunch of retired tired thespians, a bit too salty
Shit, their blood pressure high, why?
They don't play no more, probably
(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?

Now you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way

Messing me up, my whole head
Teasing me, just like Tisha did Martin
Now look at what you're starting
Schoolboy's crush and it ain't on the hush
The whole world sees it but you can't (uh)
My peoples they complain, sit and rave and rant (come on)
Your name is out my mouth like an ancient chant (say what?)
Got me like a dog as I pause and pant
*heavy breathing*

Speaking of which
Got a leash and I wish just to rock you miss (C'mon)
Make a militant move, peep my strategy (What?)
End of the day you're not mad at me (Ugh)
Not dealing with nobody, now that's what you told me (What?)
I said, "Hey yo, it's cool, we can just be friendly" (C'mon)
'Cause yo, picture me messing it up
Her mind not corrupt, with the ill C-cups
Shit, I'm on my J.O. (C'mon)
Bullshitting, hoping that the day goes slow (what?)
Got me like a friend, what confuses me though
Is kisses when we breeze, tell me what's the deal, yo?
(Deal yo, yo, yo...)
Now you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way (ha-ha!)
Now you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things (come on)
Should I just sit out or come harder? (huh?)
Help me find my way

Now why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Making things for me towards you harder
Killing me, just when I think we're there
You douse the whole vibe and the flows in the air
Telling me 'bout next man
But next man ain't the nigga with the plan
Who got your heart in mind?
It's about time that you just unwind (C'mon)

And let it just happen, make it front-free (uh)
Just sweat me like Moneypenny (uh)
Digging you, getting inside of your stee (what?)
It's the Quest cat keeping you company (ha)
Forever, or however you want it
Word, word
Now wait a minute, ma, before you jet into the curb (Yeah, yeah)
Start to make affections, which is goo,d not the herb
But it, it ain't me, and I, I ain't blurred (Ugh)
I'ma still just chill with you
Maybe things could change if you change your view (C'mon)
If not, then, I guess it is cool (Yeah)
Just to keep to yourself and abide by the rules, right

Like that y'all
Check it out now...
Check it out now...
Like that now...
Check it out now...
Wha wha now...
Check it out now...
Yeah yeah now...
Check it out now...
Check it out now...
It's like that now...
Check it out now...
Yeah yeah now...
Check it out now... (Ahem)
What you say, what? what?
Now you caught my heart for the evening (Talk it out now)
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way (Now sing it)
Now you caught my heart for the evening (Sing it out)
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things (Take your time)
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way (Now talk it out)
Now you caught my heart for the evening (Talk it out now)
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way (Now sing it)
Now you caught my heart for the evening (Sing it out)
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things (Take your time)
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way (Now talk it out)23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yo, ATCQ, Massive and crew
Bars to any beat, we beat the beat for true
Massengale MC’s, you smell like pussy stew
Don’t let it be you, man up my youth
Phife, you should've spoke of, man you'rein the mode of
Leave that to me, el-Hajj Malik
The man with a plan who went for it all
Like Marauders on a mission when we killin' dance halls
Mmm, Saga boy, Trini man
Ride out when mic is in mi hand
Loved all of mi fans, one, two, three of dem all of the gang

With a couple pound a weed and a couple dollar van
Hmm, broke pockets, find another plan
Yeah, cyan dun, push up on the one
And big up the sound man, dibby dibby DJ walk
Ayo Bus with them a talk
They don’t want no prob, they don’t want no issue
Outline them in bloodclaat chalk
Earlier in the night when we bring out the music
With a box and a band killer sound boy movement
Live and direct when it all goes down
You an idiot boy, you don't wanna fuck round
Big tune make the world go round
Make way for the sound boy crown
Don't you know we're the wickedest sound
One box off in your face make a sound boy frown
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound
Solid wall of sound, solid wall of sound

Sound checking, a million watts are shaking the room
In just a few hours you're gonna feel the burn
All of the goons are checking their guns at the door
A solid wall of sound is here on tour
It's gonna get loud—so no phones allowed

Listen up, everybody, the bottom line
I'm a black intellect, but unrefined
With precision like a bullet, target bound
Just living like a hooker, the harlot sounds
Now when I say the harlot, you know I mean the hot
Heat of the equator, the broth that's in the pot
Jalick, Jalick ya wind up ya hip
Drafting of the poets, I'm the #7 pick
Licks, licks, licks, boy, 'pon your backside
Licks, licks, licks, boy, 'pon your backside
Listen to the fader, Shaheed lets it glide
Tip the earthly body, heaven's on my side
Even in Santo Domingo when I got a Gringo
We got mics, when do we go?
Know a little nigga who can rhyme when you ask me
Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy

1 for the treble, 2 for the bass
You know the style, Tip, it's time to flip this
I like my beats hard like two day old shit
Steady eating booty MCs like cheese grits
My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me
But just in case, I own more condoms than T.L.C
Now the formula is this: Me, Tip, and Ali
For those who can't count, it goes 1-2-3
The anti-batty boy, big up is who I be
Brothers find this hard to do but never me
Some brothers try to diss but Malik, you see 'em bitching
Me no care about them dibby MC, my shit is hitting
Trini gladiator, anti-hesitater
Shaheed push the fader from here to Grenada
Mr. Energetic, who me sound pathetic?
When's the last time you heard a funky diabetic?
I don't know, man, I don't know, man, I don't know, man
I don't know, I don't know
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!

Complementary are we, the three for poetry
I got a humdinger coming hook, line and sinker
The Timbo hoofs with the prints on the ground
Timbos on the toes, I like the way it's going down
Down like a lady of the evening
When it goes in Toots, just believe it's in
'Cause Queens is the county, Jamaica is the place
Take off your cleats 'cause you can't run the race

Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!

-gy

1988 senior year at Garvey High
Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
Lounging with the Tipster, cooling with Sha
Scoping out the honeys—they know who they are
I was the b-ball playing, fly rhyme saying
Fly girl getting but never was I sweating
'Cause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll
Until I met my match—her name was Flo
Yeah, I messed around with the one called Flo
All the troopers 'round the way used to call her a ho
But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go
'Cause I thought it was me like Bell Biv Devoe
But little did I know that she was playing with my mind
The only thing I learned is good girls are hard to find
I feel like Heavy D, I need somebody for me
Not someone whose mind is blank and tryna juice me for my banks
Swinging with my main man Lucky behind my back
What type of crap is that—yo, how's about a smack?
Word life, I can't front, thought I was all that
But now it seems, I've met my match
I was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack
Settling down with one girl, wasn't trying to hear that
I had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen
Tina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy
Used to love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em
Find 'em, lose 'em - also abuse 'em
My whole attitude was new day, next hon
And believe it or not, they all got done
Well here comes Flo with the crazy whip appeal
And I'm all true man like Alexander O'Neal
Is this really love, then again how would I know
After all this time trying to be a super ho
She finally played me, but yo I'd find another
'Cause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter
Ayo, it's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like butter baby
It's like butter, it's like the butter baby
Not no Parkay, not no margarine
Strictly butter, strictly butter, baby

I remember when girls were goodie two shoes but now they turning freaks
All of a sudden (we love you Phife!) ease off ho, my name's Malik
Phife this, Phife that, where you going, where you at
These girls don't know me from jack, yet I feel like the Mack
You didn't want me then, so yo hon, don't want me now
Here, Here - take the towel, wipe off your brow
And take the contact out your eye, you're far from looking fly
You get an E for effort, and T for nice try
Now tell me what's the reason, for dying your hair
Slum village gold still dangling in your ear
You barely have a neck but still sporting a rope
Four-finger ring just so Phifer can scope
You looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do
Yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
Your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
And if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you
If your hair and eyes were real, I wouldn't have dissed ya
But since it was bought, I had to dismiss ya
But if you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it
If you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it
If you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it
I asked who did your hair and you tell me, "Diane made it"
If you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe
But I can't stand, no bionic lady
Trying hard to look fly, but yo, you're looking dumber
If I wanted someone like you I would've swung with Jaime Sommers
You wanna be treated right, see Father MC
Or check Ralph Tresvant, for sensitivity
'Cause I am not the one, I got more game than Parker Brothers
Phife Dawg is on the mic and I'm smooth like butter17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
