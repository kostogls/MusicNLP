Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

Niggas wanna try, niggas wanna lie
Then niggas wonder why niggas wanna die
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain
How can I maintain with that shit on my brain?
I resort to violence, my niggas move in silence
Like you don't know what our style is, New York niggas the wildest
My niggas is with it, you want it? Come and get it
Took it then we split it, you fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gon' do when we run up on you?
Fuckin' with the wrong crew, don't know what we goin' through
I'ma have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas
Lemme find out there's some more niggas that's runnin' with your niggas
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle
Light it up like a candle just 'cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes like you bustin' grapes
Think you holdin' weight then you haven't met the apes
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

Is y'all niggas crazy? I'll bust you and be Swayze
Stop actin' like a baby, mind your business, lady
Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' to get rid of you, yeah I know, it's pitiful
That's how niggas get down, watch my niggas spit rounds
Make y'all niggas kiss ground just for talkin' shit, clown
Oh, you think it's funny? Then you don't know me, money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it, dawg, I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean, come up off that green
Rob niggas on Ravine, don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
And, yo, I'm a slave 'til my home is the grave
I'ma pull capers, it's all about the papers
Bitches caught the vapors and now they wanna rape us

Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Look what you done started, asked for it, you got it
Had it, shoulda shot it, now you're dearly departed
Get at me, dawg, did I rip shit? With this one here I flip shit
Niggas know when I kick shit it's gon' be some slick shit
What was that look for when I walked in the door?
Oh, you thought you was raw? Boom, not anymore
'Cause now you on the floor wishin' you never saw
Me walk through that door with that four-four
Now it's time for bed, two more to the head
Got the floor red, yeah, that nigga's dead
Another unsolved mystery, it's goin' down in history
Niggas ain't never did shit to me, bitch-ass niggas can't get to me
Gots to make a move, got a point to prove
Gotta make 'em groove, got 'em all like, "Ooh"
So 'til the next time you hear this nigga rhyme
Try to keep your mind on gettin' pussy and crime

Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop

Talk is cheap, motherfucker!128EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You wack, you twisted, your girl's a ho
You broke, the kid ain't yours and everybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, "So?"
"I love my baby mother, I'll never let her go"
I'm tired of weak-ass niggas whining over puss
That don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?

You keep walking, 'less you tryna end up red
'Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
'Cause you's a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Get pushed like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brung out
Run up in there, everybody come out, don't nobody burn out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga running his mouth, I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, your ass is about to be missin'
You know who gon' find you? (Who?), some old man fishin'
Grandma wishin' your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest

This life shit, this life shit is like
Is like bugged the fuck out, son, for real
See, to live is to suffer
But to survive
Well, that's to find meaning in the suffering

Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

I've been through mad different phases like mazes to find my way
And now I know that happy days are not far away
If I'm strong enough I'll live long enough to see my kids
Doin' somethin' more constructive with their time than bids
I know because I been there, now I'm in there
Sit back and look at what it took for me to get there
First came the bullshit, the drama with my mama
She got on some fly shit so I split and said that I'ma
Be that seed that doesn't need much to succeed
Strapped with mad greed and a heart that doesn't bleed
I'm ready for the world or at least I thought I was
Baggin' niggas when I caught a buzz
For thinkin' about how short I was
Goin' too fast, it wouldn't last, but yo I couldn't tell
Group homes and institutions prepared my ass for jail
They put me in a situation forcin' me to be a man
When I was just learnin' to stand without a helping hand
Damn, was it my fault, somethin' I did
To make a father leave his first kid at seven doin' my first bid?
Back on the scene at fourteen with a scheme
To get more cream than I'd ever seen in a dream
And by all means I will be livin' high off the hog
And I never gave a fuck about much but my dog
That's my only mothafucka I hit off with my last
Just another lil nigga headed nowhere fast
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

That ain't the half, shit gets worse as I get older
Actions become bolder, heart got colder
Chip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch
Didn't need a clique 'cause I scared a nigga that much
One deep with the pit startin' shit for kicks
Catchin' vics, throwin' bricks, gettin' by bein' slick
Used to get high, just to get by
Used to have to puff my L in the morning before I could fly
Ate somethin', a couple of forties made me hate somethin'
I did some coke, now I'm ready to take somethin'
Three years later showin' signs of stress
Didn't keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed
I'm possessed by the darker side, livin' the cruddy life
Shit like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife
Wanna make records but I'm fuckin' it up
I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Wasn't long before I hit rock bottom
Niggas talkin' shit, like, "Damn, look how that rock got him!"
Open like a window, no more indo
Look at a video, sayin' to myself: "That coulda been yo
Ass on the TV," believe me, it could be done
Somethin's got to give, gots to change 'cause now I've got a son
I gots to do the right thing for shorty
And that means no more gettin' high, drinkin' 40s
So I get back lookin' type slick again
Fake niggas jump back on my dick again
Nothin' but love for those that know how it feel
And much respect to all my niggas that kept it real
Kept a nigga strong, kept a nigga from doin' wrong
Niggas know who they is and this is your fuckin' song
And to my boo who stuck with a nigga through

Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up

Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up

You tryin' to fuck all these bitches? I'ma show you how
But whoâ¦? Name's D like you, but my friends call me Damien
And I'ma put you hip to somethin' about this game we in
You and me could take it there, and you'll be
The hottest nigga ever livin', that's a given? You'll see
Hmm, that's what I've been wantin' all my life
Thinkin' about my little man so I call my wife
Well, your dada is about to make it happen
(What you mean, my nigga?) I'm about to make it rappin'
Today I met this cat, he said his name was Damien
He thinks that we're a lot alike and wants to be my friend
(You mean like Chuckie?) Ha ha, yeah, just like Chuckie
(Dada, looks like we're both lucky) Yeah

The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?

You sure? I coulda swore it was over a ho?
Nah, nah, that ain't my style, nigga, you stay frontin'
But you're still my man, and I ain't gonna say nothin'
Got some weed? Go 'head, smoke it! Go 'head, drink it!
Go 'head and fuck shorty! You know I can keep a secret (aight)
I'm about to have you drivin', probably a Benz
But we gotta stay friends, blood out, blood in
Sounds good to me, fuck it, what I got to lose?
Hmm, nothin' I can think of, any nigga would choose
Got me pushin' the whips, takin' trips across seas
Pockets stay laced, nigga, I floss G's

But yo, I need a favor, these cats across town hate me
Plus their behavior hasn't been too good lately
What? Anything for you, dog, where them niggas at?
38th from Broadway, aight, let me get the Gat'
Run up on 'em strapped, bust off caps in four niggas
Laid low for 'bout a month then killed two more niggas
Now I'm ready to chill, but you still want me to kill
Look at what I did for you! Dog, come on, keep it real!
Aight, fuck it, I'ma do it, who is it this time?
Hey yo, remember that kid Sean you used to be with in '89?
Naw, that's my man! I thought I was your man?

If you love somethin', let it go
If it comes back to you it's yours
If it doesn't, it never was
Hold me down, baby

Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day

Hold me down, niggas wanna know me now
Didn't want to play with me when to show me how
No meow, 'cause it's all about the bark
Let the dog loose, baby, it's about to spark
Light up the night like the 4th of July
Niggas know, when I let go, niggas die
With this Y and you don't know, you slow
Like Baltimore, if you ain't tryin' to go you blow
I soak up all the pain and accept it in silence
When I let go it's violence, 'cause the wildest
Is the dog barkin' up the tree for the cat
In the fog, what y'all niggas see is the bat
Flappin' away, but I'm blind like Stevie
Niggas don't hear me, still tryin' to see me
Stop bein' greedy, you heard what I said
Let me go, let me flow, or I'm dead
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day

I sold my soul to the Devil, and the price was cheap
And yo, it's cold on his level, 'cause it's twice as deep
But you don't hear me, ignorance is bliss and so on
Sometimes it's better to be thought dumb â shall I go on?
Yo, on the real, what the deal? It's a mystery
How is it I can live and make history?
If you don't see it, then it wasn't meant for you to see
If you wasn't born with it, it wasn't meant for you to be
But you can't blame me for not wantin' to be held
Locked down in a cell where the soul can't dwell
This is hell, come meet the Devil and give me the key
But it can't be worse than the curse that was given to me
It's what I live for, you take away that and I'm gone
There's a difference between doin' wrong and bein' wrong
And that ain't right, just keep it fair, baby
Put me in the air and I'll take it there, baby, yes!
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day

I'ma flow regardless because I'm an artist until I'm trapped
I'ma continue to hit the hardest whether I scrap or rap
Give me dap, but you ain't my friend
I see it in your eyes, you contemplate my end
You waitin' for that bend in the road where you were told
That you would go when you were old and if you died young, it was cold
Sold, not for nearly what it was worth
Think back 26 years, be like, "What if his birth
Was a miscarriage and I never existed?"
Have I given somethin' that if taken away you'd have missed it?
Didn't know, yet I persisted, it was the call of the wild
I merely say what's in my heart and you call it a style
Don't put it in a cage, don't mistreat it
You say you hunger for knowledge? Here it is, eat it
Another song completed is another thought captured
Let me do my thing, I got it locked with this rap shit
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day

Or give me death
Or take my breath
I'ma die anyway
But I'll be gone any day
Or give me death
Or take my breath
I'ma die anyway
But I'll be gone any day
Where my niggas?

And never give a dog blood, 'cause raw blood will have a dog like what? (What?)
Biting whatever, all up in your gut (Come on)

Ten niggas on him, hope God's with him
Give me the bat, let me split him
I'll have 'em where the pillow and the casket won't fit him (Come on)
Only reason I did him, he wouldn't fight back
Tried to strike back, left him like that
Laying up with the white hat
Getting right back at ya when I snatch ya
Up out the grave, nothin' but bones and ashes (Get 'em)
Hittin' niggas with gashes to the head
Straight to the white meat, but the street stay red
Bitches gon' give me head for free 'cause they see (Uh-huh)

And eventually found that's what you get for stinking (Uh-huh)
Blowing up the spot when you rot (Uh)

Yo, ayo let's get papers and pop Mo' with hoes up in skyscrapers
In condominiums, overlooking our drug capers
New York City, know only way to play is gritty
I want cheddar, so we can front up in the 850
My whole committee like to puff L's and look jiggy
Who wan' test this? My semi leave you chestless
And ain't shit that you can say to me when you be breathless
Young, but I done did shit that you won't do
So go ahead wit the bullshit you blab about goin' through
I got niggas who pump on yo' block and in your spot
Who sit next to you? Protectin' you?
But they'll murder you, playa
Don status, nigga we gettin chipsesis
And bad bitchsesis, fronting, fronting in eclipsesis

Ayo, Ma$e and The LOX
We taking knots from the out of state spots
Any nigga make it hot, get found in vacant lot
You don't really wanna come try, the one guy
Who stay dumb high from blunt lye
The Rikers, Sing Sing alumni
Who got more beef than a Islamic farm
So I pack enough sonic arms to neutralize atomic bombs
It's not a nigga in your gang want it
My AK slay gays, spray strays wit niggas' names on it
Often I bug, then bust off on a thug
Have a chump coughing blood, fill his coffin with slugs
Yo, you know I got enough guns to wreck a nation
Any nigga wave a TEC at Mason, have a explanation
You bring your crew and 'em and I'm doing 'em
Then I'm beating 'em down with aluminum
Then I'm putting two in 'em
You can't touch me, I've been devil sent, wanted for embezzlement
A lot of other things, but that's irrelevant
If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started something
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started something
If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started something
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started something

Yo, check out the kid that get coke like Sosa
Never turned down chocha, be in the Costa
Rica, sipping margaritas with a mami
Cleaning my Tommy, showing love to my army
Whenever The Lox find rippy blocks, we kill 'em
Yeah I hear niggas, but I still don't feel 'em
And this for the listeners, and prisoners
And them jealous rap cats that prefer dissing us
My 16's be so real
You can feel 'em in your vein
Like Ramello's pops from Sugar Hill
J be the cause for the kiss at your wake
Cartel lips, spitting clips at your face
We started from the bottom, you'll see beg niggas' pardon
Whatever, we can do it at the Garden
Word life, this shit is real, B
I'm making niggas blow trial even if they not guilty
I want a palace for my thugs, with oriental rugs
Green bags from drugs, get whacked for the love
Twenty niggas batter me, still couldn't shatter me
I'm only getting up, splitting up your anatomy
Official LOX family, grants niggas handing me
I want the finer things, and I hope you understanding me
Sitting at the table, planning and plug the fan in
Let the sweat dry off and then grab your cannon
Think you're smartest, and retaliate the hardest
Regardless, if you're a thug or a rap artist
Respect me like Pesci
And if rap was hockey, I be Gretzky, puffing Nestle
And y'all niggas done starting something
Acting invincible like you God or something
If you God, then I'ma make salat 'til you rot
And if you a playa, then play for everything you got
And if you a thug, then start busting off shots
And if you a dog, you better bite before you bark

If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started something
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started something
Don't come at me with no bullshit, use caution
'Cause when I wet shit, I dead shit, like abortions
For bigger portions, of extortion and racketeering
Got niggas fearing, fuck whatchu heard, this what you hearing
How much darker must it get, how much harder must it hit
See if your hardest niggas flip, when I start a bunch of shit
I like pussy, but not up in my face, so give me 3 feet
'Cause when we creep, no more than 3 deep, niggas see sheep
Bloodhounds found your shit buried in the mud
Following traces of gun powder, residue and blood
A positive ID is impossible, so you know
John Doe is what they gon' be putting on that tag on your toe
Now who gon' tell your mother, her baby's under a cover
In the morgue, stiff as a log, sniffed out by the dogs?
Another hardheaded nigga that wouldn't listen
So you got what you came for
(What's that?) Surgery with the chainsaw
I hit the fucking streets
'Cause, like I said before, ain't nothing going down until I eat
Muh'fuckers think it's all about impressing bitches and stressing bitches
Well, I'm testing bitches game, undressing bitches, and caressing bitches
And dealing with muhfuckers on all levels, what I'm dealing with is all devils
Fucking with snakes running with niggas you call rebels
I got an army of 730 niggas, dirty niggas
That come through and worry niggas
30 niggas that like to bury niggas
And scary niggas get it all the time
'Cause what they got is all of mine, your man was talking shit until I pulled the nine
And if I don't know you, I don't fuck witchu
And if you with my man, then he getting stuck witchu
And gave it the money, 'cause I just lost my mind when he crossed the line
Sent his back through his chest then I tossed the nine
Boss of crime, black Gotti, I stack bodies with the black shottie
Bitch-ass niggas that act snotty
Get it

These niggas is for real
These niggas ain't playing
This ain't no fucking game
She think we playing?

It's like he's gotten worse than before, son of "I wonder"
What type of dirt this nigga got in store for me to get under?
Then I get the call: "Yo?" â "X!Police just killed your cousin, underneath the projects
Don't get vexed, niggas'll pay, 'member I got you
Told you I got you; Dawg, I got you!"
I'm in a catch twenty-two, but them niggas got to pay
But I know he gon' be askin' for a favor one day
But fuck it, I ain't got no choice in the matter
Them faggots killed my peoples, and I wanna see 'em splatter
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, we ain't on no kid shit
And I'ma use the same gun that you killed them two kids with
Is that hard to live with? â Nah â See, you still a playa

Nah â What's the bag for? â Fuck it, what you want?
Can your nigga come inside, for a minute and puff a blunt?
Here we go again... â After what I just gave you?
Wasn't actin' like that, when you asked for that favor
Yo, I ain't asked you for shit! â Oh, yes you did!
When you really needed somethin' then you allowed me to give
You sold me your soul when you didn't say no
Just let a nigga go; now gimme what you owe!
Fuck were you thinkin'? Ain't shit for free!
Ain't a motherfucker you know can defeat me!
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned
And with your help, I know the Devil won't win!

Y'all lookin' for names, I'm lookin' for beats
Y'all lookin' for fame, I live in the streets
Y'all talk the talk, but I walk the walk
School street, home of the brave, New York
Y'all make movies, but I make moves
Straight up, y'all got somethin' to prove
Y'all niggas duck, but I swing back
Y'all niggas run, but I bring gats
Y'all niggas whisper, "X is a crackhead"
Aight fuck it, I'mma just crack heads
I bang niggas that cross the line
Y'all niggas talk shit from way behind
I stand my ground, but y'all niggas don't
Shit I go to jail, but y'all niggas won't
Y'all niggas walk around and get scared
But I don't give a fuck, I don't care

I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all

Kells get it crackin', y'all play chess
Kells gets to scrappin' and y'all just flex
Why is y'all rappin, when I got next
You roll with them and I'll rock with X
Eastside motherfucka, Cleveland Brown
Burning leaves in the gutta, make it Cleveland loud
All I know is when the beefs on, the beast comes out
EST is in the buildin, we run this town
Ruff Ryders, you got a problem come find us
Hop up like the sand man right behind ya
Like where the cheese bitch fuck lasagna
Pair of shoes size bags, loot stuffed inside 'em
Grimey, bare hand, no tool beside me
I don't talk online, hater come here find me
Me against the world, underdogs new Rocky
Givin a fuck if anyone co-sign me likes that uh!
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all

Y'all niggas is pussy, straight up ass
I keep that thing, and I'll blast
Letcha man know, he don't wanna push me
Remember, it's you not me that's pussy
Y'all niggas walk light on your toes
I come through hard, kickin' down doors
I spit a mean 16 without a pause
Then let 16 go just because
You in it for the dough, I'm in it for life
You in jail beatin' your dick
I'm fuckin' your wife
I bring the drama, I bring the noise
Kidnap yo mama, bring her to the boys
I make shit happen with one word
You take shit laughin' nigga, you's a bird
I take niggas for everything they got
That's why I'm the dog, and you not

I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
