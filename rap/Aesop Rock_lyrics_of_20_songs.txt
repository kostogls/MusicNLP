I'm— trust me, I'm— trust me, I'm trying to help
I'm— trust me, I'm— trust me, I'm trying to help

Flash that buttery gold
Jittery zeitgeist, wither by the watering hole, what a patrol
What are we to Heart Huckabee, art fuckery suddenly
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like, "I'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt"
Fine, sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like, "That's not a riot; it's a feast, let's eat!"

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass"
None shall pass, none shall pass
Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
‘Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch
And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz
Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Like, "Wait, let it snake up out of the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go"
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass"
None shall pass, none shall pass
You tried, you tried, you tried to trick me
You've got a, you've, you've got a, a lot of nerve
I'm, I'm not, I'm not, trying to trick you
I'm try, I'm try, I'm trying to help
Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this:
Duty and Death
Anyone object, come stand in the way
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
Fine, sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up
To make a dark horse rush, like, "Enough's enough!"
It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff
'Til all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wingspan
Even when the cubicle shrink
You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
N.Y. Chew through the machine

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass"
None shall pass, none shall pass87EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Put one up for Shackle Me Not, clean logic procreation
I did not invent the wheel, I was the crooked spoke adjacent
While the triple sixers' lassos keep angels roped in the basement
I walk the block with a halo on a stick, poking your patience
Y'all catch a thirty-second flash visual
Dirty cooperative med platoon
Bloom, head-trip split ridiculous
Fathom the splicing of first-generation fuck-up
With trickle-down anti-hero smack (Kraken!)
I pace my game for zero hour completion cretin, splash
Duke of early retirement picket dream
American Nightmare hogging the screen
I'll hold the door open so you can stumble in
If you'd stop following me around the jungle gym
Now it's honor, and I spell it with the 'H' I stole from heritage
Merit crutched on the wretched refuse of my teeming resonance
I promise, tempest-tossed breed with a bleeding conscience
See, the creed accents responsive but my sports divorced the wattage
And I'm sleeping now — wow! —yeah, the settlers laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when the buzzards drag your brother's flags to rags
You won't be laughing when your front lawn is spangled with epitaphs (You won't be laughing!)
Then I'll hang my boots to rest when I'm impressed
So I triple knot 'em and forgot 'em
His origami dream is beautiful
But man, those wings will never leave the ground
Without a feather and a lottery ticket, now settle down
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day

Slacker-bound intimate tabloid headline with a pulse
Shimmy cross the centerfold, enter dead time engulfed
Divvy crumbs for the better souls
With seven deadly stains, adhere the blame to crystal conscience
The result's a lowlife countin' on one hand what he's accomplished
Okay, link me to activism chain activate street sweep
Plug deteriorating cenobite pendragon
I hock spores coursed by the morbid
Spreading of mad men, Alley gospel
Sinking your Lincoln-Log cabin and Charlie Chaplin waddle
I could zig-zag and zig 'em again
For the badge dreams sparkle in my brick wall windows
Another thick installment of one night in Gotham
Without the wretched; Houston, we have a problem
Attached to the festive batch of city goblins
Who split holiday freaks on a box cut cinema high road bellow
Head gripped, watch red bricks turn yellow
Sort of similar to most backbones at camp Icarus
Where all fiddler crabs congregate and get pampered for bickering
Life's not a bitch, life is a beautiful woman
You only call her a bitch 'cause she won't let you get that pussy
Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests
Or maybe you're just an asshole who couldn't sweet talk the princess
Kiss the speaker wire Peter/pacifism pegging threshold
Stomach full of halo kibbles
Wings span cast black upon vigils
Here to Duck Hunt ticker tape vision and pick apart the pixels
I got a friend of polar nature, and it's all peace
You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
Metal Captain, this cat is askin' if I've seen his bit of lost passion
I told him: "Yeah," but only when I pedaled past him
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day

Used to draw
Hard to admit that I used to draw
Portraiture and the human form
Doodle of a two-headed unicorn—it was soothing
Movin' his arm in a fusion of man-made tools and a muse from beyond
Even if it went beautifully wrong
It was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong
No name nuisance, stews in a bedroom
Oozing a brand-new cuneiform
Barely commune with the horde
Got a whole grayscale ungluing his world
Might zone out to the yap of the magpie
Unseen hand dragging his graphite
Cross contour, little bit of backlight
Black ink after a Bristol to baptize
You can't imagine the rush that ensue
When you get three dimensions stuffed into two
Then it's off to a school where it's all that you do
Being trained and observed by a capable few
Back in New York, five peeps and a dog
In a two-bedroom, doing menial jobs
Plus, rhymin' and stealin' and being a clod
Distractions free to maraud
I left some years a deer in the light
I left some will to spirit away
I let my fears materialize
I let my skills deteriorate
Haunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing
A mission that was rooted in a twenty-year affinity
In rickety condition with an ID crisis
Nap on the front lawn, look up in the sky, it's…
Shapes falling out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
And there were colors pouring out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
Used to paint
Hard to admit that I used to paint
Natural light on a human face
Stenciled fire on his roommate's bass
It was blooming addiction
Amiss in the pushing of pigment
Book like a tattooed pigskin, look
Pinhead kids of the minute
Drank Kool-Aid from a tube of acrylic
And it grew up into linseed oil over linen
Joy to the poison, voice of the resin
Capture a map of the gesture
Back up, add a little accurate fat to the figure
Redo that, move that inward
Zinc white lightning shoots from his fingers
Studio strewn with illusion and tinctures
Stay tuned for the spooky adventures
You can't imagine the stars that align
When a forearm starts foreshortening right
Or a torso hung on a warping spine
In proportion reads as warm and alive
Routine day with a dirt cheap brush
Then a week goes by and it goes untouched
Then two, then three, then a month
And the rest of your life, you beat yourself up
I left some seasons eager to fall
I left some work to bury alive
I let my means of being dissolve
I let my person curl up and die
Eating up his innards, an unfeasible anxiety
Has brutally committed to relinquishing his privacy
Aligning with the trials of the anti-Midas
Nap on the back lawn, look up in the sky, it's…
Shapes falling out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
And there were colors pouring out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings

I'm getting sick and tired of never understanding
Where is the truth you promised?!30EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Look…
Unsigned hype, front line aeronauts flurry
Zero dark thirty
Zero Friends minotaur-fugly stepchild
Evoke lunch jumped over plunging necklines
Up, beside tongue-tied hungry enzymes
Devolved into mothmen munching textiles
Punisher, out past go-time
Back 10 fried worms chubbier
Brown grass both sides
Canned food, manmade tools
Lanacane, band aids, mandrake root
Bindle on a broomstick, pancaked shoes
And a handshake-proof campaign, can’t lose
Can’t gain
Smoke out moles like a force of nature
Pray fortune return to his favor, swiftly
Maybe in the form of a nest egg
Maybe in the form of a Tesla death ray
Or a solid gold scene with something better to celebrate
Than powder on a face like a flatfoot on jelly day
M-m-moral compass all batshit
Spinning in the shadows of immoral magnets
Are we supporting the artist or enabling the addict?
I mean, I guess it matters to me, I wish it mattered to you
How a thousand virtues
Kick the same bucket like chinatown turtles
Roving packs of elusive young become
Choke-lore writers over boosted drums
In the terrifying face of a future tongue
(Down) Down from a huntable surplus to one
Down from a huntable surplus to one
(Down) Down from the huntable surplus to one

Check his own breakneck pulse over colors in a drain
That emote sugar skulls in the rain
Flower-eyes melting
Guided by a levee made of bath tiles, tilting
Quarter up and headed for the kill screen
No corner cut, no build team
Only a particularly menacing
Angle perpendicular to everything
Boys room cherry bomb
Boy/goon very much runnin' with the devil in the mellotron
Hello! Here’s where a tale of caution
Pounds coffin nails to bootlegs of Hawkwind
Saw tooth, nevermind straw to gold
Spin hearts on sleeves into heads on poles
Arm in the maw
Fish out pith like a business card from a jar at the mall
A-alike androids dreaming of carbon applause
Get stuffed with cartoon cigars
Cold pack, neti-pot, home to roost
Around folk backed into what they most lampoon
Shook to the fevered brow and broke ankles
Daisy, declawed pound, no thank you
Fade me, failed all basic training
But I spent a couple groundhog days with a changeling
Silhouette,  the god’s last cigarette
Anything less would be ri-god-damn-diculous
Roving packs of elusive young become
Choke-lore writers over boosted drums
In the terrifying face of a future tongue

We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies
We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee
No, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies
We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go

And the last shall be
First to immerse in the pass out heat
Face in the mud where the moxie melt
'Till he woke up drowning in tchotchke hell
More in a cave with a torch on the wall
Than a window arrangement of porcelain dolls
On a brand new day, saw what he saw
Property owners who crawl to the mall
With a bad toupee and a face like he author the law
Pace like he mourning a loss
Right hand on a can of worms
Left full of gold he will trade for turf, I mean
That's ok, you got to answer to you at the end of the volatile day
But a model of mercy and might, no way
Marionette who will clap and obey
Dude, look, all that noise
Call that flight of the water boys
Meet and greet and they all slap five
Cheek to cheek when they colonize
And a grown-ass man shall abide as he wish
Walk that path with a dime and a stick
Walk that path with a diamond and wine
Walk that path to the firing line
Just walk, pay no mind
To the new recruit with the play-doh spine
Let's be friends from opposite ends
Wave to the kid don't hop on the fence
Play to the radius far and away
Orbit wide don't park in his space
One little martyr who talk in his face
Make one little Weathermen sharpen the blades
We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies
We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee
No, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies
We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go

And the last shall be
First to the curb with the mad cow meat
Face in the bars of a regular cell
When he woke up high in collectible hell
Boom town kid who was taught by the binge
That a man who expire with the most shit win
That's warpy American nonsense penned by the rich
Not a routine friend in a pinch
Still not used to the stench
How it throws off otherwise lucid events
In the case the afraid observe
I got a Pro-Keds box full of layman's terms, it goes
Hey, peace, pray for the plagued
Major relief and capacious rains
But just cuz I don't want to war with you
It don't mean go warm up the barbecue
I'm like pardon you, sawed off limit
My high noon is a quick little minute
I don't wanna spend it sitting with a critic
Who simply isn't going to ever really get it
This HQ is alive and alone
No driveway no sign of a home
No dial tone, no line for the phone
No world's tiniest violin song
And I might just lie to them all, lie in the morgue
With a deep breath hiding and bored
Fighting a smile, highly annoyed
When the timing is right I will rise and record
Call for the monster beats and Blockhead got
Animal drums like he's doctor teeth
It goes red light green light 1 2 3
One large coffee, fuck you, peace
T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S
T-A-K-E-N-O-P-R-I-S-O-N-E-R-S

I crawled down to the basement
When the weather got cold
Like a lost lamb returning to the fold
And when the outside world recedes from view
It's just a year's supply of make-up
And memories of you
1967 Colt 45, holding back the vampires
Keeping me alive
There's an envelope with some cash in it
Out by the front door
This is what they make you take the medication for22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Uh, greasy grimy gopher guts
Poolside, O for 1 and don't forget spoons twice
Lukewarm Folgers, mold on his moonpie
Rooms in his home that dissipate into fruit flies
Suicide lane wide load ride looting in the wake of an amicable marooning
My duty go from moving in packs to sharing food with a cat
To Mom "It's me, I accidentally sawed a woman in half"
She said "I'll keep you in my prayers," I said "I need to hide a body"
She said "Ok, honey, talk to you on Friday"
Apparently we share a common plasma so the growing disconnection doesn't matter, according to the blood-and-water chapter
Weird, who wrote the blood-and-water chapter anyway?
Probably some surly dad, only child, 30 cats
Looking for a way to reconnect with an averted past
Except it doesn't always work like that

Today I pulled three baby snakes out of moss and dirt
Where the wild strawberry vines toss and turn
I told them, "You will grow to be something inventive and electric;
You are healthy, you are special, you are present"
Then I let them go
Oh...

You were sitting at the gate awaiting spirits and provisions
I was privy to a headache over pirouetting innards
In the mirror sweating pitchers
Who's there: simian or lizard?
As it were there is a disappearing difference
In ambition and material
Antiquated gentleman outlaws reduced to a ferris wheel of vitriol
Move as a godless heathen: black gums, tooth gone, bootleg 'Yukon Cornelius'
I'm a... That's better, here we here we go
Disenchanted face printed on a zero-dollar bill
Got a little plot of land where authority isn't recognized
Contraband keeping the core of his Hyde Jekyll-ized
Check! Never mind a misanthrope vying for affection to the wretched sound of mysticism dying
It is something he must handle on his own
The windblown way
Wanna win? Don't play
Today I pulled three green frogs out of leaf and bark
Where the grapevines climb a convenient barn
I told them, "You will grow to be something tenacious and exalted;
You are mighty, you are gracious, you are lauded"
Then I let them go
Oh...

I have been completely unable to maintain any semblance of relationship on any level
I have been a bastard to the people who have actively attempted to deliver me from peril
I have been acutely undeserving of the ear that listen up and lip that kissed me on the temple
I have been accustomed to a stubborn disposition that admits it wish its history disassembled
I have been a hypocrite in sermonizing tolerance while skimming for a ministry to pretzel
I have been unfairly resentful of those I wish that acted different when the bidding was essential
I have been a terrible communicator prone to isolation over sympathy for devils
I have been my own worst enemy since the very genesis of rebels

Today I pulled three ghost crabs out of rock and sand
Where the low tide showcased a promised land
I told them, "You will grow to be something dynamic and impressive;
You are patient, you are gallant, you are festive"
Then I let them go
Oh
(On and on and on and on...)17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Whatcha doing there

Hobgoblin, shots of hot Strongid
Vaccine queen deem church socks hostage
9 weeks awesome, hides in a slipper
Look in her eye like she might be a wizard
Cold met a cat lady in a parking lot
She got the heroes of tomorrow in a cardboard box
And probably hoarding 40 more in the corners of Fort Knox
Swapped 20 on the spot and cop the warlock
Back at the haunt, found God in the hamper
Briefs on her head playing Walking With a Panther
Good around misery and golden era samplers
Jeopardy and Wheel at the heels of her handlers
Bet, more than a pet to worship
It's an MD recommended sense of purpose
Here to bat around keys and the means to euphoria
Soon to be hailed, the greatest of all warriors
Hey Kirby
Whatcha doing Kirby
Whatcha doing there (I'm not takin' no shorts)
Hey Kirby

Why'd you eat that leaf (Yo, yo, yo)

Homie don't fetch, only woke to stretch
Under a thought bubble rich with bowls of goldfish
Skittish in the company of stranger danger
Otherwise, chase draw strings, tails and lasers
In a steel cage match with a maze of cables
Brazen, game-face based on Azazel
Oversized ears up, puke in the Meow Mix
Shred a pair of earbuds, remedy his cowlick
: Thanks Kirbs, looking like a milli
Keep an old man sharp, keep a cold Chantilly
Spun plum dizzy in a frisky moment
Never lands on her feet though, I think she's broken
Mouser in training, nap on the toaster
Decorate her cubicle with dogs playing poker
15 years taking prescriptions
Now a shrink like, "I dunno, maybe get a kitten"

Question: If I died in my apartment like a rat in a cage
Would the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face?
I used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain
I'm trying to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste
The kid is comfortably numb, routine a tedious crutch
Steep in a self-imposed Stockholm and Lima in flux
Maybe an occupation popular with demons and ducks
Made any mingling akin to being seasoned and stuffed
It's a theatre of jumping jellyfish, jealous little sycophants
Miserable and flimsy from the skippies to the pissy pants
Each one separately convinced
They're sketching with Da Vinci's hands
Delusion turned the communication to prison camp
You fucking dorks ain't a threat to the cause
There ain't a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost
I think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts
Step out the tempest, a measure of what the spectrum involves
Maybe no one cares
Party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

I used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene
It meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe
Maybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive
I know some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe
I think we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong
This song's our echolocation up in impregnable fog
That's why it's odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws
Ascend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs
In a mess of obnoxious fantasy, posturing and pageantry
I ain't even mad, I'm impressed, shit it's baffling
God almighty, chop an ivory tower to piano keys
Play your own dirge on the way to surfing maggot beach
You fuckin' dorks ain't a source of the art
You can't be cooler than the corners
Where you source all your parts
The poker-faced, all it takes a couple sordid remarks
We let the manticore out, We make the sorcery bark
Life is so unfair
Party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

I view the rattling of sabers like a show to expose
Insecurities exploding in emotional code
When braggadocio to go from mostly jokey to gross
Corrode a homie 'til his probity is notably ghost
Before the hobby was a job, he was a miniature hell
You would wobble round your momma like an infant gazelle
The disillusionment has truly been a difficult pill
But you as anything menacing is a difficult sell
In a whistle and bell-o-rama
Black mollies that dress up like piranha
It's not even compelling melodrama
It's a comedy, somebody wanna shop you as a saga
I'm very voluntarily persona non grata
You fuckin' dorks ain't the leaders we need
This ain't the medium for divas out to weasel and breed
I'm offin' coffee with the paupers over tea with the queen
Don't make him show the regency what disobedient means
Heavy load to bear
Party over here, I'll be over there
Don't need no help, all by myself9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Tech support, feral army
In a cave on a failed bit of terraforming
Four corners of paranormal
Get shorn for a thermos and pair of thermals
In the warehouse air where his dairy curdles
St. Vincent de Paul trying to square the circle
Circle the source of his power
Foresight born at the corner of Howard on sale
Cherry pick blue in the pale
It's a blue-nose chewin' his tail, losing his coat
Schmoozing a high and a head-rush
Hack up bile over H1N1, and then some
One eye on the breadcrumbs
Other eye on the Drencrom
Other other eye on the income
Good knife and a grin
Shoot dice with the lice and the ring worms
Peg leg, smells like Medellin
Wake in the night, make a pipe out of anything
Take 5, take a dive in the cellophane
Turn 5 into 5 6 7 8
Back out, black out somewhere fancy
Shaped like the backseat of Aesop's Camry, dude...
Seat full of chips and sandwich meat from the crypt
In the end if you give an address in a river of piss
Don't question the mystery fish
Just picture shrimp on a pillow of grits
Close your eyes, lick your lips
I'm at the cafe ordering a cup of fresh
Sara gave me 2, I gave one to Rex
He said, "Fools ain't shit plus fuck the pigs
They could never understand what Sumner is"
(Word up, word up, word up)
I'm off the grid
I'm through the gate
I fly these kites into the fray
(Word up, word up, word up)
I'm out the box
I'm through the mud
I fly these kites into the cut

NorCal fried bacteria
No ID survive the vivarium
Try soft wheels, sourdough and heroin
Eat with the chimera, fly with the seraphim
Might hold court with the cats and dogs
Who hold Kools like an orb in a dragon's claw
In terry cloth robes outside detox surly
Curse at a beat cop, doctor a Slurpee
Adopt no Xerxes, fear no moon man
Stay true like a wolf wearing wolf pants
Oooh, never could avoid himself
For long enough to contain or employ as help
And now he look both ways at the asteroid belt
Buzzed, gross and wholly unloved
Still hear an ex in his head yelling, "kiss the ring"
From a fortune to Fisher King
Or from assisted care, blisters in his hair
New day, new diary of disrepair
Soups on, 2-ton crucifix to bear
No shoes, no shirt, no fiscal year
I said hello to Marshall every morn for 6
He yelled at me every time, that's amore, bitch
It only took one tooth to crack the bug juice and chug
Turn a bum to a Sun Tzu, it's bug
Outside home is an open swim
Occultism in the throes of corrosive wind
A cold meal with the ghosts of friends
A whole host of meds, a deal on a Tone Loc cassette
I stepped over a body in the door
I pretend he asleep but it's probably more, God damn
Profound apathy, heart with a crack
I'm ships in the night, I'm darts at a map

My first name is a random set of numbers and letters
And other alphanumerics that changes hourly forever
My last name, a thousand vowels fading down a sinkhole to a susurrus
It couldn't just be John Doe or Bingo
My address, a made-up language written out in living glyphs
Lifted from demonic literature and religious text
Telephone, uncovered by purveyors of the ouija
When checked against the CBGB women's room graffiti
My social, a sudoku, my age is obscure
My in-case-of-emergency is in the daisies, chasing birds
Employed by trillionaires with perfect teeth and pores
And people who open doors for the people who open doors
My medical history is a course at SUNY Buffalo
Charlatan psychiatry and troubleshooting undertow
Nervous in the service, still, I'm burger meat and purple pills
—"Here." —"Thank you. We'll call your name." —"Sure, you will."

Skipped lunch
I'm shrunk

You pack up all your manias, you're sitting in the waiting room
You're dreaming of arcadia, you're feeling like a baby tooth
Awaiting panacea, channeling your inner Beowulf
In purgatory, just before you pay up to filet yourself and others
In the name of help, coal on a conveyor belt
Into ego death alone, no telephone from Gabriel
I'm half a human, combin' over Home and Garden stoned
Gold chains over turtleneck, cigars over cologne
A thousand shitty paintings wrapped around a wounded animal
Woo him with the Schubert, he's a future human cannonball
Little fuckers fighting, mother hiding in her Hulu
I'm climbing up the stucco, let's get to the seppuku, uh-oh
That pretty penny turned the prickly into Benji
If you save up all your winnings then you get to count your blessings
I finally crunched the budget up and punched the button
She called my name out and pushed me into an oven
The fuck?
I'm shrunk

She says, "I'm not your enemy."
I said, "That sounds like something that my enemy would say."
Instead of playing off the chemistry
She said, "You're being difficult." I said, "I'm being guarded
You're a quarter-mil' in debt; I get more guidance from my barber
Look—I'm not good at this, I grew up in a noogie-fest
You built your walls up high or said goodbye to all your Cooky-Puss
Here's one: every time my telephone buzzes
I see images of hooded riders setting fire to hundreds."
She said, "When you start getting all expressive and symbolic
It's impossible to actualize an honest diagnostic."
I said, "When you start getting all exact and algebraic
I'm reminded it's a racket, not a rehabilitation."
Okay, agree to disagree as grown-ups from opposing clans
Honoring the push and pull, I should've called the Scholomance
Oh well, preservation is a doozy
—"Will you be needing another appointment?" —"Absolutely."
I'm shrunk!5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yup! Steps up to the plate
Little brother, Little League, '87—he was 8
Rookie season for the skinny slugger newly out of T-ball
Pit against a pitcher with a ripper you could eat off
Church, then a grip of loons run to third first
Granny yelling, "Go Cubs!", nose in her word-search
Seen MILFs like apes on a monolithic bleacher
Into advocating war and peace in lieu of sport and leisure
"Hi, Peggy!" I was 10, chewing on a Sweet Tart
Little brother, left field, queen's guard, mean arm
Knees bent, two out, two on bags
When I caught him staring down at something moving through the grass
Hold up; tagged runner, and the whole cast rotate
Not before he could identify the culprit
Granny yelling, "Go Cubs!" Graham yelling, "Gopher!"
New left fielder give a fuck about a homer
Got a homie, little rodent, head and shoulders out his hovel
No baseball in the bubble, ruh-roh
Parents thought it adorable, the players followed suit
Inning crawling to a close, head coach not amused
Coach seeing red, coach on the diamond
Dragging 27 inches of aluminum behind him
When he transverse third, the families turn nervous
The following is a transcript of "Man vs. Vermin"
Here we go: man stands out by a hole
Pest pops up to patrol
Man plays live Whac-a-Mole
In a scene that would try every child as adults
Whoa, pall-bore with a ball mitt
Thrown over the fence, coach hit the bench
Both teams lose, "Good game, good game"
Granny yelling "Go Cubs!" Cubs ain't playing
My little brother is a funny dude
A lot of funny shit happened to him
My other brother pretty funny, too
Ain't seen him in a minute, though

The one, the— Th—Th—The one, the—
Th—The one, the— The one, the two, the three
Just in case of rough waters
I want to put one up for my brothers
Th—The one, the— Th—Th—The one, the—
Th—The one, the— The one, the—the two, the three
Just in case of rough waters
I want to put one up for my brothers

Yup! Not a part of the machine
Big brother, big idea, '9-0, 16
Neubauten tee, plaid flannel-laden, adolescent art kid
Tony Hawk hair, Skinny Puppy denim
And a record player vomiting Alien Sex Fiend, Peel Sessions
In a Christian home for field testing
It's real youth in the palm of your hand
When your mom thinks Satan is involved in a band
We were buried in the Village Voice, checking who was playing where
Pulled his head up out the paper, pushing out a single tear
Five words, like a beacon of light in the mist:
"Ministry live at the Ritz"
It was "Christ Has Risen" to Chris, three loaves, two fish
Miracle of mechanized loops on two-inch
Coming to a theater—he would be there in the flesh
Moms didn't say "No," but she didn't say "Yes"
Cop tickets—ah, the plot thickens
Countdown to ultimate concert experience
Ma still wary: "And why are they called Ministry?
Are they a cult?" Maybe she would probably investigate
Bought a mag with an Al Jourgensen interview
Read a couple sentences, glanced at a pic or two or three
That's all—no fair trial
Simply, "You will not be going to the show, and that's final!"
What occurred next were the top of the lungs
Of a son who, unjustly, had lost what he loved
In a moment that would transcend anger to high art
Said, "This is something I am willing to die for!"
Can you even imagine?
A death in the fam from industrial fandom?
Anyway, no body count, no concert
And Chris kicked rocks in his mismatched Converse
My older brother is a funny dude
A lot of funny shit happened to him
We hadn't spoken in a couple moons
I called him last night: "How you doing?"

The one the— Th—Th—The one, the—
Th—The one, the— the two, the three

I  see how y'all be trying to front, man y'all be fronting, man

Been a bit since Mu died
Been a lot more loss in the wake
I recall thinking, "Someday, someone's gonna say it's all from the same cause and effect"
And I just couldn't fathom blaming a whole new page on a made-up chain reaction
Each claim individual peaks and pockets
Pains and a slew of unique nuances
Nah mean? When you wake up eight years non-responsive
It's a lot to process
Gone from a happier jack-in-the-box
To a package of clogged up chakras
Oh, shazbat! Not the "ever after" he wanted
From the "Once upon a time, dot, dot, dot"
Once upon a time, he was so much more
Than a punchline for his own potshots, ah
Watch the Impossible Kid
Everything that he touch turns promptly to shit
If I zoom on out, I can finally admit
It's all been a blur since Mu got sick
None of the subsequent years stood a chance
Whether you his moms or his mans
Whether you his pops or his girl, I was poison
Heart full of canines, head full of voices
Whole life trying to quiet 'em down
Like a suicide king with a knife in his crown
Hounds at bay, but they just won't stay
True friendship in a tugboat way
A go dark in the face of the fucked
When the fucked was a friend, that was basically done
Into the woods go his alien tongue
It was that or a textbook faking of funk, and I can't
Here go the hindsight:
Eight years been one long blindside
I could pinpoint seven more turns that occurred 'cause he never really healed from the first
Oh, what a world, any hack is a myth
Any dap is a joke, any map is a trick
Any graph is a hoax, ease on down
I'm burning up, I'm bleeding out
Knowing ain't half the battle—that's a bullshit quip written by some asshole
You can own what you are and still sit around stoned in your car
Not doing shit, halfway to nil
Cranky and waiting for a boss key and hat full of bills
Get out the car, Aes7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Somebody in a cultivated moment of distress
Composed themselves enough to artfully carve "Zoso" in his desk
They was probably thinking "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!" in they head
With a hell bound arm in a acidy wash
Homemade curfew a thousand o'clock
And the pot leaf tattoo his friend did drunk
Like a badge of mystique though it technically sucked
Taking the name of the father in vain
On the way to the blade in his locker
Estranged
A switch he lifted from a sibling's skivvy drawer
Who'd branched off into ninja stars
And never knew his shit was sharked to
Here with a higher purpose
And a primal urge of juvenile berserkers
Like Crocea Mors in a arcade drop claw
Gouging a valentine for Miss Othmar
Watch
Capital Zed, slowly maneuver the O
S is the most difficult to control
Finally O
Into the eye of Goliath you go
That levy crushin' percussion'll pull the monkey upright
Twelve or ghetto blaster
Black or technicolor telecaster
Lecture at a faster rate than class was making them develop backwards
It would appear you spelled out all the answers
When they ask how you, feeling you, tell em you, feeling like
Something important died screaming, you, tell em you, feeling like
Something even more important arrived breathing, something you should probably try feeding
When they ask how you, living you, tell em you, living like
Something important died hissing, you, tell em you, living like
Something even more important arrived giving
Something you should probably try willing
(alright, same here)

Somebody in a cultivated moment of distrust
Composed themselves enough to magic-marker “Zulu” on these chucks
They was tryin to do the buckle font from ‘Renegades of Funk‘
In a 3d frame of exploding brick
And whiz-lines for the locally motion sick
Beyond gross but evoked a host of “oh dip”
Where a social neurosis owned the whole strip
Heart of a cat with a lark in his mouth
In the marrow of waiting his guardians out
Flashlight
Chisel tips
Milked venom
Pistol grip
Images relocated from milled vellum to scissor kick
Silent agreement at hand
King of the hill for a queen of the damned
She in the doorway seething began
“That clean white pair had a 3-year plan”
Oops
Capital “ZED” Radical “U” in the cut
Truly to beautiful “L"oser it up "U" and he done
Collateral damage a future alum that key to Shambala
Planet rocking Bambaata
Sample chop
Churning out a cancer for the vandal squad
Analog
And he finds
Animated colors on a page
Like synthesized cultures on a stage
When they ask how you, feeling you, tell em you, feeling like
Something important died screaming, you, tell em you, feeling like
Something even more important arrived breathing, something you should probably try feeding
When they as how you, living you, tell em you, living like
Something important died hissing, you, tell em you, living like
Something even more important arrived giving
Something you should probably try willing

Somebody in a cultivated moment of resolve
Composed themselves enough to publicize "the Zeros" in this stall
They was scoping every dog and pony previously scrawled
With a festering hate for the gum drop edge
‘Disco sucks’ tee, punk‘s not dead
But a transient teen unsung godsend
Via 3 bar chords and a mugshot grin
(Cheese!)
Sign of a runaway tone in the face of authority, thumbing it's nose
Cutting it's teeth
Pretzled up in special order vinyl, and
Birds that dip their belts in little metal porcupine quills
2 dutch at a show in the front, low-key to the can
For a smoke and a fuck, Trixie, fixing her lipstick up
When his mitts got bit by the mischief bug
Snatch
Capital “zed”, terrible “e” in vermillion red
Gimme an “R", "O” and a slippery “s”
Over a web of the shittiest bands
That beat your heart out
Never bleeped your favorite parts out from a learned curve
Of bird fingers bursting out of germs burns
Urgently
Offered through the circuits of an earlier plot
I’ll see you at the bottom ZZZ top9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Baseheads locally approach all spark plugs
Total disregard for a dying man's shark jump
Post-meridiem pretty tungsten attracts any once-pale horse painted gunmetal black
Face masking, hard-shelled ebony propeller hat
Clubmans, gloved rakes grappling the clutch span
Tuck go the steel toe, metal gate spreading
For the dead-alive that rented parking space 37
2000 out the weekly under "Cycles to Gehenna" gets him floating over 20 buses
Fireproof and festive
Corners like a two-tired tiger so a too-tired rider can accumulate a few excited fibers to assign
Knows no zen in the art of maintenance
Only as the orchestrated patron saint of changing lanes baby
Here is how a great escape goes when you can't take your dead friends names out your phone

Eyes and teeth, new moon on a scale that defies belief
Outside what our fundamental sciences teach, every other mighty lion asleep
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth

The man-ape translates glam thru the visor
Goes in water lillies
Am-scrays Giger, and man-ray
Crammed in a one-player campaign
Blinker like a hallowed bonfire over Samhain
Span where the praying hands mandate
Bars an extension of the arms
They're mutating instead of being farmed
Tonight beneath a marmalade Venus
Haunted mowers chewing every glowing yard of mud between us
Going Ford, Jag, Datsun, Corvette, Lotus
All cones you can slalom when your Zorlac's focused
Via mechanical Dartmoor Frankensteined poorly
And sanctioned by a New Yank Yorkee
Who knew that any moment he could lose it to the decopaged suicide flooring
And still he keep his fuel tank portly, the 30 odd year old gears thank Charlie
The scarf thank Mom's new hobby, kssssht! copy
Eyes and teeth, new moon on a scale that defies belief
Outside what our fundamental sciences teach, every other mighty lion asleep
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth

It was less of an act of hubris
More a lonely hearts club at the helm of a magic bullet
Away on a relentless bid for rarefied inertia
Rattletrap forks married to the patchy terra firma Ursa Minor getting warmer
I crowbar into the pecking order
The dreck between the whores and Betty Ford-ers
Hug a double yellow spine
Knobby rubber like a rat on a rope
Those little fuckers run on passion alone
This is the product of a DIY inadequate home
Grabbing a cabin in the-fuck-outta-dodge
Actin' a savage in the shadows of Rome
Traffic amassed against insufferable odds
Fashioning gallows out of plastic and bone
I got the motordrome walls of death splintering under me
All-city galvanized bikes white knuckling
Bright light, tunnel kings tuck in the devil
PS - I wrote this on a self-destructing memo14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Lucy was 7 and wore a head of blue barrettes
City born, into this world with no knowledge and no regrets
Had a piece of yellow chalk with which she'd draw upon the street
The many faces of the various locals that she would meet
There was Joshua, age 10, bully of the block
Who always took her milk money at the morning bus stop
There was Mrs. Crabtree and her poodle
She always gave a wave and holler
On her weekly trip down to the bingo parlor
And she drew
Men, women, kids, sunsets, clouds
And she drew
Skyscrapers, fruit stands, cities, towns
Always said hello to passersby
They'd ask her why she passed her time
Attaching lines to concrete, but she would only smile
Now all the other children living in or near her building
Ran around like tyrants, soaking up the open fire hydrants
They would say
"Hey, little Lucy, wanna come jump double dutch?"
Lucy would pause, look, grin and say
"I'm busy, thank you much"
Well, well, one year passed and believe it or not
She covered every last inch of the entire sidewalk
And she stopped-
"Lucy, after all this, you're just giving in today?"
She said:
"I'm not giving in, I'm finished," and walked away
1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed
A-B-C, that's the speed of the need
You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it, cause dreamers always chase but never get it
1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed
A-B-C, that's the speed of the need
You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it, cause dreamers always chase but never get it

Now Lucy was 37, and introverted somewhat
Basement apartment in the same building she grew up in
She traded in her blue barettes for long locks held up with a clip
Traded in her yellow chalk for charcoal sticks
And she drew
Little Bobby who would come to sweep the porch
And she drew
The mailman, delivered everyday at 4
Lucy had very little contact with the folks outside her cubicle day
But she found it suitable, and she liked it that way
She had a man now: Rico, similar, hermit
They would only see each other once or twice a week on purpose
They appreciated space and Rico was an artist too
So they'd connect on Saturdays to share the pictures that they drew
(Look!)
Now every month or so, she'd get a knock upon the front door
Just one of the neighbors
Acting nice although she was a strange girl, really
Say, "Lucy, wanna join me for some lunch?"
Lucy would smile and say "I'm busy, thank you much"
And they would make a weird face the second the door shut
And run and tell their friends how truly crazy Lucy was
And Lucy knew what people thought but didn't care
Cuz while they spread their rumors through the street
She'd paint another masterpiece
1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed
A-B-C, that's the speed of the need
You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it, cause dreamers always chase but never get it
1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed
A-B-C, that's the speed of the need
You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it, cause dreamers always chase but never get it

Lucy was 87, upon her death bed
At the senior home, where she had previously checked in
Traded in the locks and clips for a head rest
Traded in the charcoal sticks for arthritis, it had to happen
And she drew no more, just sat and watched the dawn
Had a television in the room that she'd never turned on
Lucy pinned up a life worth's of pictures on the wall
And sat and smiled, looked each one over, just to laugh at it all
No Rico, he had passed, about 5 years back
So the visiting hours pulled in a big flock of nothing
She'd never spoken once throughout the spanning of her life
Until the day she leaned forward, grinned and pulled the nurse aside
And she said:
"Look, I've never had a dream in my life
Because a dream is what you wanna do, but still haven't pursued
I knew what I wanted and did it till it was done
So I've been the dream that I wanted to be since day one!"
Well!
The nurse jumped back
She'd never heard Lucy even talk
Especially words like that
She walked over to the door, and pulled it closed behind
Then Lucy blew a kiss to each one of her pictures
And she died
1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed
A-B-C, that's the speed of the need
You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it, cause dreamers always chase but never get it
1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed
A-B-C, that's the speed of the need
You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it, cause dreamers always chase but never get it

Zoom in to the fuming of an aggravated breed
Via the study of post-adolescent agitated seeds
Half the patients wasted self prior to Commencement
So I focus on the urban Oxygen samples, the half that made it breathe
They sold Pompeii impression, waste infections
And twelve steps to lesson
Cretins swiftly tippy toe on hard to swallow, barter concepts
The give-it get-it, never let it self passport our stubbornness
Martyrs talks money causes in a harvesting Spartacus
And so on I've thrown long Hail Mary bombs
Toward cookie-cutter Mother Natures bedazzled synthetic fabrics
Life treats the peasants like
They tried to fuck his woman while he slept inside
Well they're merely chasing perfectionist emblems
When the clock strikes nine
I'll be waking with the best of routine caffeine team players
For the cycle of it
Under a dusted angel harp string Big Brother is watching
My odometer like buzzard to fallen elk, talking stealth
We got babies, rubber stamps, and briefcase parts
We on some door-to-door now
Order ten dollars or more, we'll shove it down your throat for free
I'll sacrifice my inborn tendencies
For copper pennies for one commanding "Gimme that"
So we can retain baby fat
Make the biter snake bedlam
Holocaust freak, heckle shiesty brain headroom shaped planet
Make a move, pause, make a move break cannon
Bent barrel one eight zero, U-Turn, squeeze, end it
It's on like it's never been
It's bleeding well
It's bigger than a breadbox
It corrodes my leaky finance
I'll take my seat atop the Brooklyn Bridge
With a Coke and a bag of chips
To watch a thousand lemmings plummet just because
The first one slipped
Sometimes I laugh at victory, kissing these little question marks
I tend to underestimate my average
Just another bastard savage
Someday you'll all eat out of my cold hand
Cuz every dog has its day
At which point, I'll pull it away
Now we the American working population
Hate the fact that eight hours a day
Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us
And we may not hate our jobs
But we hate jobs in general
That don't have to do with fighting our own causes
We the American working population
Hate the nine-to-five day-in day-out
When we'd rather be supporting ourselves
By being paid to perfect the pastimes
That we have harbored based solely on the fact
That it makes us smile if it sounds dope

It's the year of the silkworm
Everything I built burned yesterday
Let's display the purpose that these stilts serve
Elevate the spreading of the silk germ
Trying to weave a web but all that I believe in is dead
Nah brother, it's the year of the jackal
Saddle up on high horse
My torch forced Polaris embarrassed
Shackle up the hassle by the dooming legend marriage
I bought some new sneakers
I just hope my legacy matches
It's the year of the landshark
Dry as sand, parched, damn get these men some water
They're out there being slaughtered
In meaningless wars so you don't have to bother
And can sit and soak the idiotbox trying to fuck their daughters
Man it's the year of the Orphan
Seated adjacent to the firefly circling the torches on your porches
Trying to guard the fortress of a king they've never seen or met
But all are trained to murder at the first sign of a threat
Maybe it's the year of the waterbug
Cockroach utter thug specimen
Fury spawned from dreaming of your next of kin
I'm still dealing with this mess I'm in
I've been the object of your ridicule
You've been a bitch lieutenant
God, it's the year of the underpaid employee
Spittin' forty plus a week
And tryin' to rape Earth on my off time
You bored dizzy, I can't keep myself busy enough
So you can run run run
And I'mma let you think you won
EVERYBODY!
We the American working population
Hate the fact that eight hours a day

Hate the nine to five day-in day-out
But we'd rather be supporting ourselves

Fumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition and
Yawn and stretch and my life is a mess and
If I never make it home today, God bless

Postcards from the pink bath paint leisure
As a cloaked horse through a stained-glass Saint Peter
Hack faith-healer, cheat death to the very end
Cherry wooden nickels on his specs for the ferrymen
X-O, Zodiac a pentagram expo
Pet Cemetery in electric fresco
Abaddon threshold, flash forged in a galley
With undead orcs pulling oars through the algae
Smash cut to a smoke-bombed quarantine
Guards like, "All signs correlate with sorcery"
It's more a dormant cell of valor as awoken by the smell of sordid power
And defecting shortly after
Fist bump dry land, brackish
Cat nap 15, back to swiss-cheese the flagship, uh
Blue in the menacing grip of a day for which you're manifestly unfit

Final answer "not to be", "not to be" is right!
Next question - to build winged shoes or autophagy
Silk-screen band tees, take apart a VCR
Ringer off, canned peas, cabin fever mi amor
Patently adhering to the chandelier at key-in-door
To usher in the understated anarchy of leisureforce
Led a purple tongue and ratty Caballeros
Up over the black rainbow into the house of mirrors
To become a thousand zeroes, echoing a twisted alchemy
Freak flags, fluttering to circadian free jazz
Sleep apnea, scratching, "bring that beat back"
I doze off, clothes on, nose in the feedbag
Shhh... Om nom, nom, blinds drawn
Compost thrown to the spine pile, bygones
Mangy, intimately spaced pylons
On a plot of inhospitable terrain, "Hi mom!"
Midsummer, bit crusher, midwinter, bit shifter
Midsummer, bit crusher, midwinter, bit shifter
No sleep, gold mine, front door circled
Proceed, low light, 24 curfews

Crows beak, cold night, unmoored virtue
Proceed, snow-blind, 24 curfews

Raise up the bridge, lower the portcullis
Rain forks into mutton, no abort button
Core pump, assorted color sugar water
Poor lummox, unexplained ailments and doesn't work well with others
Wet nose on the glass, Garibaldi half cookie dough
Lock jaw, Don 4 walls like a wooden coat
Behold the rotting fruit of excommunication:
A ruby tide insubordinate to lunar phases
That maneuver past the beaches to the bosom of the pavement
Now the bow drill smolder in a flooded bit of basement
Grace of a misled teen who prefers his scenes with a little Wilhelm scream
The ambush predator edition
Skill set of Will Tell aim and speed over short distance
Part hatter-mad, part erratic habitat
Dark matter harnessing his heart attack-ack-ack-ack-ack

Day turns night, day turns night
Day turns night, day turns night
Day turns night, day turns night
Day turns night, day turns night
Night Light, sucka!!!

Put one up for shackle me not clean logic procreation
I did invent the wheel, in a previous generation
While the triple sixers' lassos keep angels roped in the basement
I locate modern halos and pass 'em out to the cavemen
Y'all catch a 30-second flash frame
Dirty cooperative med platoon
Bloom, head-trip split fantastic!
Fathom the splicing of major-league low-life
With anti-hero earthworm mentality – Godzilla!
I pace my game for zero-hour completion
See, a cretin's still a cretin, even speakin' altered moniker
American nightmare lost in the monitor
I'll hold the door open, so you can stagger through
Then send berserker-bred Jukies in after you
It's Gutter, and I spell it with the 'G' I stole from "Get the fuck up!"
Noise crutch stolen wretched refuse of my teeming dumb luck
Still I promise: temperance towards breed still bleeding Amish
See, the freaks sucked out the wattage
While three bears invade the cottage
And I can't sleep now! Yeah, the police'll laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when you're hosted
By the ghost of Christmas past
You won't be laughing when your blow-up doll's got a headache and won't give up the ass
I'ma lay my kicks to rest when I'm impressed
So I staple-gun 'em to my feet
This origami dream is beautiful: pull the tail, watch the wings flap
But you really can't do a thing with that
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Swallow up the pieces, spit 'em at your species
Beached in a city of lost barnacles and leeches
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
(Day turns night)
Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light
Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light
Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light
Night Light, sucka!!!

I'm pretty sure I got a pulse
Plus we Shimmy cross the centerfold, and our night light engulfed
Just let me keep the crumbs (Please!)
With seven deadly stains, adhere the blame to crystal conscience
The result's a dead-beat tryin' to make a dollar off a bomb threat
Okay, link me to activism chain, activate wild-style Pluto orbit
Set a course, then push the button
I swallow spores born by the laws
Of a morbid glutton– Alley gospel
I can spot a duck battalion by the Charlie Chaplin waddle (gone)
Zig-zag and zig 'em again
Before the pig can pull a badge out for the lash out
Another thick installment of one night in Gotham
Like, "Houston, we have a problem: they're buffing the trains the same day the graffiti writers bomb 'em!"
Who split holiday freaks on box-cut cinema high road bellow?
Head gripped, watch red bricks turn yellow!
I'm tryin' to meet the wizard, but a tailgating tin-man holding a oil can won't let a hermit crab break in his new shell-toes
Life's not a bitch: life is a beyotch
Who keeps the villagers circling the marketplace
Out searching for the g-spot
Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests
Or maybe you're just an asshole – maybe I'm just an asshole!
Kiss the speaker wire (*kiss*)
Sammy Swashbuckler pagan threshhold
Stomach full of diner food, wingspan cast black upon views
Here to help release the rabid hounds or pick apart your mood
I got this friend of polar nature, and it's all peace
You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
Metal Captain, this cat is askin' if I've seen his bit of lost passion
I told him: "Yeah," and gave him one last look and smashed him
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Swallow up the pieces, spit 'em at your species
Beached in a city of lost barnacles and leeches
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light
Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light
Night Light, Day Light, Night Light, Day Light
Night Light, sucka!!!

Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Night Light got me when the daylight went to evenin'
Day turns night, day turns night, day turns night
Day turns night, day turns night, day turns night4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

*Someone plays harmonica*
Ay
Whats this fuckin' guy doing?
What are you doing?
Right now, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Yuh
Yes sir (Yep)
Put change sh-put change in his cup
(Oh can you play it wi-with the other guitar)
Weatherman
(I like this one )
What's that weirdo with the fucking kazoo?
Ay

Sharks in the dunk tank, vipers in the garden
Locusts stole the groceries out the local Farmer's Market
All God's critters hold positions
Some are violent, some are victims
Each alive is an equal and vital piston I support
So when the piranhas honor New York
My daddy long legs dangled and mangled for sport
And while I bring in every dink in the kingdom with open wings
It all boils down to them shit-soaked pigs
The pigs (what), the pigs (what), the dregs of what y'all aim for
The gluttonous muddy stomachs under the pudgy cakehole
Two-track braniac using the food and payroll
To chew up and consume every cookie, crumb, and peso
And place a cloven hoof on the lucrative when convenient
As the bourbon-odor smokers' coughs smolder off the Cohiba
If Noah had the benefit of hindsight on his ship
He could've snatched two unicorns and left behind the motherfucking...
Pigs!
God damn... pigs!
Potbelly... pigs!
Punch-drunk... pigs!
Take money, money... pigs!
Loudmouth... pigs!
Wide load... pigs!
Let's make a deal...

When all the wolves in woolly wigs
Have huffed, and puffed, and blew the bricks
The skulls of Brooklyn's cruelest pigs
Will rain on Fulton's newest kicks
As mulish swine of all surrounding counties sniff the gruesomeness
We pass around the pineapples and pull the pins in unison
I will gladly feed you to the breed who wants you sacrificed
No pagan or sacrilege, just bacon for scavengers
I will gladly seat you with the chickens, not the passengers
Hopefully the crack in his armor spreads to his avarice
Never that, Wilburs multiply quicker than tribbles
And hunt their truffles in fistfuls, but it was all bells and whistles
Bougie this and Bougie that...
War pig or pussy cat...
Glitzy to the pork ribs, had to gold-leaf the booby traps
Powder-pink, double-breasted, mess of mud and money
Waddle off the fire to make his stubborn tummy wroggle
And while I don't really know the working details of your tribes
I know that that's one ugly fucking tie
Asshole...
Pigs!
God damn... pigs!
Potbelly... pigs!
Punch-drunk... pigs!
Take money, money... pigs!
Loudmouth... pigs!
Wide load... pigs!
Let's make a deal...

Apple in his mouth, Maraschino eyes
Party like the butcher boy's cleaver is alive
I mosey into sixteen hours of smoke in the misty winter
To see the county fair's blue ribbon winner as dinner
Then dance until the sun has kissed your blisters in the morning
As the misery was dormant and divvied in crispy portions
Corporates want to lure him in and whore him. Or does he whore the corparates to expand the more important forums for him
Push the mortar pestle past the ordinary orchard
When the frilly border's faded is the product mine or yours, pig?
Mine, plus I toss a token where I go:
Directly to the worms who shovel shit and yellow snow
This little piggy went to the market with a target
And will subsequently know the armor-piercing forks of farmers
Final words for the finer birds taking notes:
I dig a chick in pig tails, "That's all Folks!"
Pigs!
God damn... pigs!
Potbelly... pigs!
Punch-drunk... pigs!
Take money, money... pigs!
Loudmouth... pigs!
Wide load... pigs!
Let's make a deal...6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The kid that work down at the local Baskin-Robbins
Got a tattoo of a lipstick print attached above his collar
I watched him relocating pistachio to a waffle
Thinking I had lost the plot if not the passion for the novel
He asked me what I wanted, I ordered something daft
He said he liked the tattoo Alex drew me of the bats
Thanks; I like it too but modestly confess
In present company, my coloring is not the main event
Look at that neck
The message is immediate, the guy effs chicks
I spent a lot of years making friends with cool artists
So when they drew me tattoos I could truly feel important
Now some 22 year old inside a cube of brick and mortar
Got me questioning my morals and their corny pecking order
I should give a shit less
Cherry-No; Whip-Yes

Lotta years
Uh, lotta years

The girl that work down at the local juice place
Got a head full of dreadlocks down to her waist
I watched her add the spinach to the ginger to the grapes
My hair was underwhelming, my juice was fucking great
Some lady orders Maca, compliments the locks
She asked how many years it took the girl to grow the crop
"It took a lot of years and then eventually I cut 'em, kept 'em
Reattach 'em anytime I want 'em"
My mind's fucking blown
The future is amazing, I feel so fucking old
I bet you clone your pets and ride a hover-board to work
I used a folding map to find the juice place in the first
These kids are running wild, I'm still recovering from church
You should have seen me in the 90s, I could ollie up a curb
You should have seen me in the 80s
I was bumping New Edition, dragging acne into Hades
Lotta years
Naw mean? Lotta years3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
