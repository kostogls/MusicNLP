I can't tolerate your sadness
'Cause it's me you are drowning (You're drowning me)
I won't allow any happiness
'Cause every time you laugh, I feel so guilty (Guilty)
I feel so guilty

Am I forced to have any regret?
I've become the lie, beautiful and free
In my righteous own mind
I adore and preach the insanity you gave to me

Sell me the infection
It is only for the weak
No need for sympathy
The misery that is me

I've lost the ability to paint the clouds
'Cause it's me you're draining (You're draining me)
I'm stuck in this slow-motion dark day
'Cause every time you run, I fall behind, I fall behind

And so I hear my voice again
The tale of the bitter man here I am
Shake the silence and hear what it says
The tranquil pride that become the lie
Sell me the infection
It is only for the weak
No need for sympathy
The misery that is me

Sell me the infection
It is only for the weak
On bleeding knees
I accept my fate

Sell me the infection
It is only for the weak
No need for sympathy
The misery that is me

Sell me the infection
It is only for the weak
On bleeding knees
I accept my fate

Sell me the infection
It is only for the weak
No need for sympathy
The misery that is me
Sell me the infection
It is only for the weak
On bleeding knees1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Cut my throat and throw me to the wolves
I'm just too tired, too tired to reload
Don’t need your tears, I don't need your love
Don't need your sympathy, I am above
I’ll be the ghost that haunts you in your sleep
You have anchored the hate in me
Don't need your tears, I don't need your love
Don't need your sympathy, I am above

My God, I don't need you
I won't wait for you to come around
My God, as the pain inflates
I know I bleed, I bleed for you

We will never be, you aren't close to me
This is the feeling that I have been waiting for

Maybe it, just maybe it takes time to sink in
Did you not hear me loud and clear?
Don't need your tears, I don’t need your love
Don’t need your sympathy, I am above
My God, I don't need you
I won’t wait for you to come around
My God, as the pain inflates
I know I bleed, I bleed for you

We will never be, you aren't close to me

We will never be, you aren't close to me

My God, I don't need you
I won’t wait for you to come around

We will never be, (you) aren't close to me
This is the feeling that I have been waiting for

Rushing through thirty
Getting older every day
By two, drawing pictures
Of innocent times
Can you add colour
Inside these lines?

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day

Sure, if we change our perspective
I'm certain I would change today
I'm certain it would change our ways
Would things fall into place?

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere

From here, I can hardly see a thing
We're further off with every passing second
I will follow anyone that brings me to you
But the sense of time is catching up with me

Will you see me if I set fire to the sky?
If I act like I'm untouchable and golden?

Wonder when I'll hit the ground
Been to space, but I am falling
Wasting what is mine
For a voice that's calling

Who am I?
So many faces, dressed in rags for all to see
Here I am in the mask
The jester that wants to be free

I am done with watching graves grow mould
The sins are mine, I believe them to be
All the tears, they're draining me
We find the truth through tragedy
Give me a sign, I'm on my knees
Feel like you've forgotten me

Who am I?
So many faces, dressed in rags for all to see
Here I am in the mask
The jester that wants to be free

How could you leave me behind?
I'm tired, and I felt it for some time
I can't take this much longer
I'm stuck in a downward spiral
I'm stuck in a downward spiral
I'm stuck in a downward spiral


All the tears, they're draining me
We find the truth through tragedy
Give me a sign, give me a sign
Who am I?
So many faces, dressed in rags for all to see
Here I am, in the mask
The jester that wants to be free

Will you see me if I set fire to the sky?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's not so much the pain
It's more the actual knife
Pretending the picture is perfect
I cut myself to sleep
I close my eyes for a second
And meet a fragile soul
I scream to hide that I'm lonely
The echo calls my name

If I ever, if I never
Make me understand the thought whatever
Make me see, make me be
Make me understand you're there for me

Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in

The water drops just beg to hit me
Why now? Hasn't rained for days
No time to play hide and seek
I call upon you to take me on
Break me down to pieces
Put me back, do it right this time
Struggling to fill this empty shell
Burn all my efforts
In the end it means nothing
If I ever, If I never
Make me understand the thought whatever
Make me see, make me be
Make me understand you're there for me

Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in
Take this life, I'm right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in

These thoughts, burn a hole in my heart
These thoughts, will keep me feeling
These thoughts, burn a hole in my heart
These thoughts, will keep me feeling

If I ever, if I never
Make me understand the thought whatever
Make me see, make me be
Make me understand you're there for me

I got a new kind of fear, something you don't wanna view
There's this path that I can see, it leads straight to misery
We can't undo what we have done, just face what's up ahead
We fight and we stumble, the fuse is lit, you better run now

I can't tell you what to do, this crossroad is your own
But I know what we'll become, the outlaws on the run

Do you think about the end?
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space
Do you think about the end? That slow last breath of air
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space

What if I say to you: "Let's leave this earth for a while"
A perspective from the hollow and the wheel we can't control

I can't tell you what to do, this crossroad is your own
But I know what we'll become, we'll be outlaws on the run

Do you think about the end?
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space
Do you think about the end? That slow last breath of air
The words you say with your last breath and the emptiness in space
And the emptiness in space
And the emptiness in space

When we were young, was this the dream we had?
We're celebrating nothing, we need to find our way back
When we were young, was this the dream we had?
We're celebrating nothing, we need to find our way back
When we were young, was this the dream we had?
We're celebrating nothing, we need to find our way back

Have we lost the spark or a guide?
What's the latest on the screen?
Can't be too late to turn around
I need all the help from you
I need to find something to blame for a long lost time

I am running from something, I don't know
I am searching for something, which way to go?
I am trying to separate what's real
I'm running in a wheel

Is it dark or is it bright?
What's the latest on the screen?
Can you please tell me my name
I haven't checked it today

I am running from something, I don't know
I am searching for something, which way to go?
I am trying to separate what's real
I'm running in a wheel

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Are we dancing all alone?
Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today there are only a few
The sign of times my friend
Avoid infinity?
Are you for real?

(Just scratch the surface, and you will find)

Don't ever let them use you
They will bring you to your knees
I'll try to lead you for a while
But every time I talk to you, you're too afraid to see

People like you
You live in a dream world
You despise the outside
And you fear the next one!

It's in your dream
There's just one question
Should I kill, or should I be left behind?
Sick and tired
Of all your complaints
This is the hour
We bring it down

I've come to realize
With every little glimpse, you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected, cloud connected

You seem to be
So introverted
How come we fail?
With all that is given
You crossed the line
You remembered my name
Time runs backwards
And we're heading that way

I've come to realize
With every little glimpse, you fade
I was told that I could fly
Oh, when least expected; cloud connected
(Cloud connected)

I like to look at you from a distance
I like when you scream in my face
Afraid to say the right words in right order
So they makes sense to a person with such grace

What if my dreams don't become reality?
Is my life just a big mistake?
Will I be happy for the times I had?
Or would I reconsider and recalculate?

I wanna be heard, but leave no trace
I wanna be seen, but take no space
I wanna be, I wanna be, leave no trace
I wanna be, I wanna be, take no space

The older I get, the younger I feel
The younger I feel, the older I seem
The more I feel, my age seems real
I like to pretend I'm as young as I feel

I wanna be heard, but leave no trace
I wanna be seen, but take no space
I wanna be, I wanna be, leave no trace
I wanna be, I wanna be, take no space
Leave no trace
Take no space
I wanna be heard, but leave no trace
I wanna be seen, but take no space5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The serpent knows
When the curtain falls
In denial's blindfold
It greets another day

Don't believe the mask
It adapts to any lie
The perfect ten
When reality caves in

Don't tell me
Tell my ghost
'Cause I blame him for all I don't want to know

I found secrets about life's undertow

Life's wrapped in a riddle
Easier said than done
Hate to play the victim
Let's run and hide
Don't believe the mask
It adapts to any lie
The perfect ten
When reality caves in

Don't tell me
Tell my ghost
'Cause I blame him for all I don't want to know

I found secret's about life's undertow
Let them take me far away

Crawl back in place
It's easier to go behind the curtain
Wipe the worries away
No thought about a consequence

Don't believe the mask
It adapts to any lie
The perfect ten
When reality caves in
Don't tell me
Tell my ghost
'Cause I blame him for all I don't want to know

Your self control makes me feel alone
I've tried confidence, had it for breakfast today
I've lost the perfection, a mess without words
As the seasons change I'll continue to ignore
The image I project is me without me
The picture that I scanned is borrowed
After the education you stopped making sense to me
Seems to me that it's all the same
Time and time and time and time again
Slowly, what I believed in, turning into a lie
To aim and miss, my supernatural art
Spending too much time with myself
Trying to explain who I am

How come it's possible
I wish there was a way
I feel so invincible
I'm the sculpture made out of clay
I need someone to break the silence
Before it all falls apart
I need something to cling onto
Before I break you in parts
So afraid of what you may think
And all the plastic people that surrounds me
I have to find the path to where it all begins
To teach the world my supernatural art

How come it's possible
I wish there was a way
I feel so invincible
I'm the sculpture made out of clay1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

As I aim for that bright white day
Conflict serum with my aura
It seems that life's so fragile
I guess I'll fly some other time
I lack from superhighway thoughts
Won't live as long as the city lights
Soaked by underwater times
Electric splash on a midnight drive

Wish I could rape the day
Just something radical
Lost the sense of sweet things
Who's gonna take me widely?

Guided by the pinball map
The driver - still unknown to me
Who was sent to glorify?
Before we injected this common pride
Sometimes I don't belong
Release me from your world
Pacified by the small things in life
I wait for earthquakes to rearrange
Never been able to use the force
I've only have it read to me
Despite all the misguided faith
I'll find a place in this mess

Wish I could rape the day
Just something radical
Lost the sense of sweet things
Who's gonna take me widely?

Guided by the pinball map
The driver - still unknown to me
Who was sent to glorify?
Before we injected this common pride
Early morning moments
A glimpse of joy
But soon it's over and I return to dust
As I try to be
Everything and everyone
I shrivel up and waste away
Wish I could rape the day
Just something radical
Lost the sense of sweet things
Who's gonna take me widely?

Tell me which side I'm on
Approaching constant failure
Tell me which side I'm on (who is friend or foe)
Approaching constant failure

Between love and hate
Which path to follow?
How can I keep balance in this race?
Come faith, I'm dying
(Slowly)

In many ways, I'm the burden
That divides us from the light
In many ways, you're the halo
That keeps my spirit alive

Temptation
Play the good or evil part
With me, you evoke the dark
Erase, my free will, and, watch me heal

Tell me which side I'm on
Approaching constant failure

Between love and hate
Which path to follow?
How can I keep, balance in this race?
Come faith, I'm dying

Bemused by the trials and tribulations
If I survive, will I fly from here?
But as the chosen pessimist
I, I carve my name in stone
I, I carve my name in stone
Amused by the trials and tribulations
If I survive, I fly from here

Remind me I'm golden
The fortress above the sun
Why don't you spend nowhere with me
Follow the river and the path of the ones
Write our names on the shore

Forever I can't find
Struggling in a world undefined
Decide how you want it to be
I'm not eternity

Fly into the distance
Disappear for awhile
I can't make sense of this
But we're here today feeling alive

It starts to fall apart
Let me take control

The days and nothing more
Something I will find again

But it doesn't really matter
I'll give the world to you if you just

I became the blade, and I pierced through
Now hiding from the world outside
Trying to create magic for the pacified

Kill the hunt instead of lying to myself?
