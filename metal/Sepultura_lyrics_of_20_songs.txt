Unknown man speaks to the world
Sucking your trust, a trap in every word

War for territory
War for territory

Choice control behind propaganda
Poor information to manage your anger

War for territory
War for territory

Dictator's speech blasting off your life
Rule to kill the urge, dumb asshole's speech


Years of fighting, teaching my son
To believe in that man, racist human being
Racist ground will live, shame and regret
Of the pride you've once possessed
War for territory

Chaos A.D
Tanks on the streets
Confronting police
Bleeding the plebs
Raging crowd
Burning cars
Bloodshed starts
Who'll be alive?

Army in siege
Total alarm
I'm sick of this
Inside the state
War is created
No man's land
What is this shit?

Obscured by the sun
Apocalyptic clash
Cities fall in ruin
Why must we die?

Obliteration of mankind
Under a pale grey sky
We shall arise

I did nothing, saw nothing
Terrorist confrontation
Waiting for the end
Wartime conspiracy

I see the world - old
I see the world - dead

Victims of war, seeking some salvation
Last wish, fatality
I've no land, I'm from nowhere
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Face the enemy
Manic thoughts
Religious intervention
Problems remain

Obliteration of mankind
Under a pale grey sky
We shall ariseEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

One week struggling on the real world is
So you can see
Feel your soul and shape your mind to warfare
It's all for real
Live your life, not the way they taught you
Do what you feel
Survive this jungle, give me blood, give me pain
These scars won't heal

What were you thinking?
What a wonderful world?
You're full of shit
Leave it behind, they don't care if you cry
All you left is pain

Can you take it?
Can you take it?
Can you take it?
Can you take it?

The only way to get away
Kill your pride
Attitude
I won't take it
I won't take it
I won't take it
I won't take it

So in the end, I want to see some respect
I said, you better show some respect
I said, attitude and respect2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Walking these dirty streets
With hate in my mind
Feeling the scorn of the world
I won't follow your rules

Blame and lies, contradictions arise
Blame and lies, contradictions arise

Nonconformity in my inner self
Only I guide my inner self

I won't change my way
It has to be this way
I live my life for myself
Forget your filthy ways

Blame and lies, contradictions arise
Blame and lies, contradictions arise

Nobody will change my way
Life betrays, but I keep going
There's no light, but there's hope
Crushing oppression, I win
Betraying and playing dirty, you think you'll win
But someday you'll fall, and I'll be waiting
Laughs of an insane man, you'll hear
Personality is my weapon against your envy

Walking these dirty streets
With hate in my mind
Feeling the scorn of the world
I won't follow your rules

In the middle of a war
That was not started by me
Deep depression of the nuclear remains
I've never thought it
I've never thought about
This happening to me
Proliferations of ignorance
Orders that stand to destroy
Battlefields and slaughter
Now they mean my home and work

Who has won?
Who has died?
Beneath the remains

Cities in ruins
Bodies packed on minefields
Neurotic game of life and death
Now I can feel the end
Premonition about my final hour
A sad image of everything
Everything's so real
Who has won?
Who has died?

Everything happened so quickly
I felt I was about to leave hell
I'll fight for myself, for you, but so what?

To feel a deep hate
To feel scared
But beyond that, to wish being at an end
Clotted blood
Mass mutilation
Hope for the future is only Utopia

Mortality, insanity, fatality
You'll never want to feel what I've felt
Mediocrity, brutality, and falsity
It's just a world against me

Cities in ruins
Bodies packed on minefields
Neurotic game of life and death
Now I can feel the end
Premonition about my final hour
A sad image of everything
Everything's so real
Who has won?
Who has died?
Beneath the remains1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Land of anger, I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow, everything so alone
Laboratory sickness infects humanity
No hope for cure, die by technology

A world full of shit coming down
Tribal violence everywhere
Life in the age of terrorism
We spit in your other face

War of races
World without intelligence
A place consumed by time
End of it all

We're born
With pain
No more
We're dead
Embryonic cells

Corrosion inside, we feel
Condemned future, we see
Emptiness calls, we hear
Final premonition, the truth

Land of anger, I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow, everything so alone
Laboratory sickness infects humanity
No hope for cure, die by technology

We're born with pain
Suffer remains

Sacrifice is pleasure
When life ends in pain
Conceive the last mistake
Which belongs to all

Creation of insane rules
All we hear
Desperate cry

Death: the coldest wind
Seeps into your pores
A nation born of hate
Forgotten distant time

Creation of insane rule
All we hear
Desperate cry

Endless empty maze
Despair, distress and silence
A poison vacuum, infinity
Life, lies, deceit
Mute souls end in silence
Oceans tainted with blood
Empty promises of hope
Buried deep, infected ground

Creation of insane rule
All we hear
Desperate cry

Cry!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Mutations cooked in labs
Money-mad experiments
New food and medicine?
New germs and accidents!
Like Cubatão
"World's most polluted town"
Air melts your face
Deformed children all around

Bio-technology
Ain't what's so bad
Like all technology
It's in the wrong hands
Cut-throat corporations
Don't give a damn
When lots of people die
From what they've made

Face the enemy
Stare inside you
Control your thoughts
Destroy, destroy 'em all
You censor what we breathe
Prejudice with no belief
Senseless violence all around
Who is it that keeps us down?

Chained down, led lives
Blood boils inside me
We're not slaves, we're free

Each time I pull it apart
I get disgusted, can't do it today
What makes it so good
That a man would kill for it
Lie just to lick a bit
Each time I pull it apart
I get disgusted, can't do it today
What makes it so good
To lie just to lick

Fake it, you like it, just take me away
Hold it, just save it and I'll be repaid

Each time I pull it apart
I get disgusted, can't do it today
What makes it so good
That a man would kill for it
To lie just to lick a bit
Each time I pull it apart
I get disgusted, can't do it today
What makes it so good
To lie, to lick
Take it, enlarge it, became it, before
Like it, I like it, and I'll be

Fake it, then like it, just take it tonight
Take it

Perpetrated over time
Better walk the narrow line
Never challenge what we say
In the darkness of our mind
Never thought we'd be so blind
Let the nightmare get away
Isolation cannot be
The best, the best that we can do
Build a cage full of rage
Inner demons call your name
Suicide, your only friend

Extermination of ourselves
Mass incarceration
Termination of ourselves
Mass incarcerate

In the cage, in the cage
You will remain
In the cage, in the cage
You will remain
They'll lock you down
Lock you down for life
Carry out another fight
You might think you have the right
Maybe live another day
Use your body as a whore
Strip you right down to the core
You're the profit and the prey
Violate our human right
Is what, is what they always do
Out of sight, out of mind
Try to keep you dumb and blind
This is not a part of you

Extermination of ourselves
Mass incarceration
Termination of ourselves
Mass incarcerate

In the cage, in the cage
You will remain
In the cage, in the cage
You will remain
They'll lock you down
Lock you down for life
When is my trial?
Guilty for life

In the cage, in the cage
You will remain
In the cage, in the cage
You will remain
They'll lock you down

Telling lies right into your face
Grab your soul and make a disgrace
Make you believe you're bigger than life
No one cares if you'll live or die
Waiting for the moment to strike
To take possession to take your heart
Turn your part into a farce
Without respect, without regret

Cut-throat, cut-throat, cut-throat
Cut-throat, cut-throat, cut-throat

You promise this and promise that
Deep inside nothing at all
In a war of filth and greed
We don't need this kind of shit
All I say that we'll survive
We know what's true, we know what's right
We're going through this till the end
And I know you're not my friend

Cut-throat, cut-throat, cut-throat
Cut-throat, cut-throat, cut-throat
Fuck
To give in, no fucking way
To give in, no way

So don't tell us it can't be done
Putting down what you don't know
Money isn't our god
Integrity will free our soul
Enslavement, pathetic
Ignorant corporations

Why don't you get a life and grow up
Why don't you realize that you're fucked up
Why criticize what you don't understand
Why change my words, you're so afraid
You think you have the right to put me down
Propaganda hides your scum
Face to face, you don't have a word to say
You got in my way, now you'll have to pay
Don't, don't believe what you see
Don't, don't believe what you read
No!
I know my way, I'm here to stay
I didn't start all this yesterday
I'll prove you wrong all the way
Life teaches me you're always alone
Don't, don't believe what you see
Don't, don't believe what read

I am the one, Orgasmatron, the outstretched grasping hand
My image is of agony, my servants rape the land
Obsequious and arrogant, clandestine and vain
Two thousand years of misery, of torture in my name
Hypocrisy made paramount, paranoia the law
My name is called religion - sadistic, sacred whore
I twist the truth, I rule the world, my crown is called deceit
I am the emperor of lies, you grovel at my feet
I rob you and slaughter you, your downfall is my gain
And still you play the sycophant and revel in my pain
And all my promises are lies, all my love is hate
I am the politician and I decide your fate
I march before a martyred world, an army for the fight
I speak of great heroic days, of victory and might
I hold a banner drenched in blood, I urge you to be brave
I lead you to your destiny, I lead you to your grave
Your bones will build my palace, your eyes will stud my crown
For I am Mars, the god of war, and I'll cut you downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I shall redeem myself from
The clutches that grasp at my inner self
No tomorrow will ease my oppression
My streak of hate leads my way

Look at me
My feelings turn
Stronger than hate

I can't decide on which way to turn
My choices are few and far between

Look at me
My feelings turn
Stronger than hate

I can't decide on which way to turn
My choices are few and far between

A lifetime of remorse
There’s no place that I’ve never been
Go

I stand above the remains
My vengeance I have regained
I don't know what lies on the floor
I won't be locked anymore

Standing here, I’ve lost all faith
I have no social equality
To live again would be a lie
My life is not worth the pain

Looking inside, your future uncertain
The fear grows as a sickness uncured
The silence agonizes, the words sound strong
Look inside the eyes, leave this world

Hate through the arteries
Mass hypnosis

Uncertain of being back
They make you feel so good
Everything's darkened
Obey like a fool

Hate through the arteries
Mass hypnosis

Soldiers going nowhere
Believers kneeling over their sins
Inhuman instinct of cowardly leaders
Make the world go their own way
Tens of thousands hypnotized
Trying to find a reason why
Look inside your empty eyes
Obey till the end

Looking inside, your future uncertain
The fear grows as a sickness uncured
The silence agonizes, the words sound strong
Look inside the eyes, leave this world

Hate through the arteries
Mass hypnosis

Soldiers going nowhere
Soldiers blinded by their faith1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
