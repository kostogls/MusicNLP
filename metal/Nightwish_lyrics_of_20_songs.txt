Crave the machine
Revere the screen
Zoom in for flak and misery
Bleed some pixels
Shoot yourself
Pose for the dead
Have a near-life experience
In a hot air matrix
Now you're a star
Vain avatar
Feeding the beast
In your loud Egoland
You have become
Tool of a tool
Digital ghouls
Telling you to
Shut up and dance!
Color a yarn and the crowds will gather
Noise
From a sunless world
Your mirror is black, only a copy stares back
At a slave of brave new world
Noise
To decoy the human voice
Brain insomniac, paranoiac
Endless noise
Please love me
See how I bleed
Please endure
I have such empathy in me
Hum, noise, hum
Beautifully numb
Tapping the quiet air
To have a meaning
By a carrion
Sad hologram
Lost in the maze
The real and human feel
Sunset is free
From this deity
The Earth has a real voice
Go out and get in
I will follow
Color a yarn and the crowds will gather
Feast your eyes on the black mirror
Feed the beast, join the gathering
Tell a tale
Feast of fears is drawing nearer
Beyond the human horizon
Something terrifying sleeps5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We used to swim the same moonlight waters
Oceans away from the wakeful day

(My fall will...)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me
I'll bleed forever
(... be for you)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me
I'll bleed forever

Scent of the sea before the waking of the world
Brings me to thee, into the blue memory

(My fall will...)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me, I'll bleed forever
(... be for you)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me, I'll bleed forever
Into the blue memory

A siren from the deep came to me
Sang my name my longing
Still I write my songs about that dream of mine
Worth everything I may ever be

The Child will be born again
That siren carried him to me
First of them true loves
Singing on the shoulders of an angel
Without care for love ‘n loss

Bring me home or leave me be
My love in the dark heart of the night
I have lost the path before me
The one behind will lead me
Bring me home or leave me be
My love in the dark heart of the night
I have lost the path before me
The one behind will lead me

Take me
Cure me
Kill me
Bring me home
Every way
Every day
Just another loop in the hangman’s noose
Take me, cure me, kill me, bring me home
Every way, every day
I keep on watching us sleep
Relive the old sin of Adam and Eve
Of you and me
Forgive the adoring beast

Redeem me into childhood
Show me myself without the shell
Like the advent of May
I’ll be there when you say
Time to never hold our love
(My fall will...)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
You were the one to cut me
So I’ll bleed forever
(... be for you)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
You were the one to cut me
So I’ll bleed forever
 (repeat until fade)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
You were the one to cut me
So I’ll bleed forever9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I. Four Point Six
Archaean horizon
The first sunrise
On a pristine Gaea
Opus perfectum
Somewhere there, us sleeping
"After sleeping through a hundred million centuries
We have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet
Sparkling with color, bountiful with life
Within decades we must close our eyes again
Isn't it a noble, an enlightened way of spending our brief
Time in the sun, to work at understanding the universe
And how we have come to wake up in it?"
II. Life
The cosmic law of gravity
Pulled the newborns around a fire
A careless, cold infinity
In every vast direction
Lonely farer in the Goldilocks zone
She has a tale to tell
From the stellar nursery into a carbon feast
Enter LUCA
The tapestry of chemistry
There's a writing in the garden
Leading us to the Mother of all

We are one
We are a universe
Forbears of what will be scions of the Devonian sea
Aeons pass, writing the tale of us all
A day-to-day new opening
For the greatest show on Earth
Ion channels
Welcoming the outside world to the stuff of stars
Bedding the tree of a biological holy
Enter life
The tapestry of chemistry
There's a writing in the garden
Leading us to the mother of all

We are here to care for the garden
The wonder of, birth of, every form most beautiful
Every form most beautiful

III. The Toolmaker
After a billion years
The show is still here
Not a single one of your fathers died young
The handy travelers out of Africa
Little Lucy of the Afar
Gave birth to fantasy
To idolatry
To self destructive weaponry
Enter the god of gaps
Deep within the past
Atavistic dread of the hunted
Enter Ionia
The cradle of thought
The architecture of understanding
The human lust to feel so exceptional
To rule the Earth
Hunger for shiny rocks
For giant mushroom clouds
The will to do just as you'd be done by
Enter history
The grand finale
Enter ratkind
Man, he took his time in the sun
Had a dream to understand
A single grain of sand
He gave birth to poetry
But one day'll cease to be
Greet the last light of the library

We were here! (x4)
IV. The Understanding
"We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Sahara. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here. We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?"
"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one. And that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."
V. Sea-Worn Driftwood

Before you
My home was in the wind and surf
The birds and rain, voices of the northern lights
Then you came
I joined you beyond the aeons
As you blew your cave bear bone
And began to hum
Eradicate the torment of a heavy heart
Emancipate the deaf
Sing the graceful third part
Then orchestrate an air for only you to sing
Caress it deep
It`s always there to unlock the stars
To enter

Music
Fanning the flames of a mystery
Deepening the listening
Losing
Yourself to the endless symphony
Of now
Human
Singing the tale of another man
Have you ever heard
Music
It is coming, coming, coming your way
The very first song

You want to dream?
Want a tale in major scale?
Wish to leave the hollow, to dance with Pan?
Can you hear the brave drum from the moors?
Follow the beat
And leave the noise behind if we be lovers
Performance starts, come join the gathering
And you will leave with a wildflower aftertaste
Become the kind who still laughs at butterflies
Give me a home inside you until the final
Thank you and a good night
In here, I am the silence of sound
Curing the common show
For the steady song
There, I`ll greet the greedy crowd
But will never, ever sing to them
Tick-tock, time stops
Follow me into the fog
To the hilltop
Follow the call sky-clad
Evoke the Hum
Allure the sirens
All it took was
Time and silence2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The end
The songwriter's dead
The blade fell upon him
Taking him to the white lands
Of empathica
Of innocence
Empathica
Innocence

The dreamer and the wine
Poet without a rhyme
A widowed writer torn apart by chains of Hell
One last perfect verse
Is still the same old song
Oh Christ, how I hate what I have become
Take me home

Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God
Save me
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
My home was there and then, those meadows of heaven
Adventure-filled days
One with every smiling face
Please, no more words
Thoughts from a severed head
No more praise
Tell me once my heart goes right
Take me home

Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
And one for God
Save me
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world, a whore for the cold world, a whore for the cold world

Sparkle my scenery
With Turquoise waterfall
With beauty underneath
The ever free
Tuck me in beneath the blue
Beneath the Pain
Beneath the rain
Goodnight kiss for a child in time
Swaying blade my lullaby
On the shore we sat and hoped
Under the same pale moon
Whose guiding light chose you
Chose you all
"I'm afraid, I'm so afraid
Being raped, again and again, and again
I know I will die alone
But loved
You live long enough to hear the sounds of guns
Long enough to find yourself screaming every night
Live long enough to see your friends betray you
For years I've been strapped unto this altar
Now I only have three minutes and counting
I just wish the tide would catch me first and give me
A death I always longed for."
2nd robber to the right of Christ
Cut in half - infanticide
The world will rejoice today
As the crows feast on the rotting poet
Everyone must bury their own
No pack to bury the heart of stone
Now he`s home in hell, serves him well
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell
Next morning dawned upon his altar
Remains of the dark passion play
Performed by his friends without shame
Spitting on his grave as they came

Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
And one for God
Save me
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world, a whore for the cold world, whore for the cold world
"Today, in the year of our Lord, 2005Tuomas was called from the cares of the world
He stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day
The music he wrote had too long been without silence
He was found naked and dead
With a smile in his face, a pen and 1000 pages of erased text."
Save me
Be still, my son
You`re home
Oh when did you become so cold?
The blade will keep on descending
All you need is to feel my love
Search for beauty, find your shore
Try to save them all, bleed no more
You have such oceans within
In the end, I will always love you
The beginning18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Now you`ve been tucked in
For eternal earthrise and wonder
A sailor through aeons
Story unheard
Howling at the Earth
Yours the whole graveyard of heavens
A ship that sailed home
You`re with us, face of the night
Singing through the morn for mankind
I want to sing with you
You`re home now, outward urge
As with every dreaming creature
We want to come with you
Here I came to be
Your reach into the far
On the stellar sea
Cut in little stars
We all wait the due night
Beauty which is worth the hurting
We`re coming to join you
Hope revived for a lifetime
To rekindle the human spark
In love with the night
Now you`ve been tucked in
For eternal earthrise and wonder
A sailor through aeons
Story now heard
Howling at the Earth
Yours is the whole starmap of heavens
Of myriad endings
We came here to be
A waypoint to the far
On the stellar sea
Cut into little
Stars calling with the sound
Of a dreamlike dulcimer
We came here to stay
With your guiding light

“And when he shall die
Take him and cut him out in little stars
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world
Will be in love with the night
And pay no worship to the garish sun”

Baptized with a perfect name
The doubting one by heart
Alone without himself
War between him and the day
Need someone to blame
In the end, little he can do alone

You believe, but what you see
You receive, but what you give

Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak

Apart from the wandering pack
In this brief flight of time
We reach for the ones who ever dare

You believe, but what you see
You receive, but what you give
Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak

Reachin', searchin' for something untouched
Hearing voices of the Never-Fading callin'
Callin'... Callin'

Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak

This is me for forever
One of the lost ones
The one without a name
Without an honest heart as compass
This is me for forever
One without a name
These lines the last endeavor
To find the missing lifeline

Oh, how I wish
For soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my everything

My flower, withered between
The pages two and three
The once and forever bloom gone with my sins
Walk the dark path
Sleep with angels
Call the past for help
Touch me with your love
And reveal to me my true name
Oh, how I wish
For soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my everything
Oh, how I wish
For soothing rain
Oh, how I wish to dream again
Once and for all
And all for once
Nemo my name forevermore

Nemo sailing home
Nemo letting go

Oh, how I wish
For soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my everything

For soothing rain
Oh, how I wish to dream again
Once and for all

We see a mother with no child
We meet a stranger poor, exiled
How`s the heart while it still beats?
Asks a no-one
Another John Doe
Sorrow hides well in your shell
A fellow man with hurt to spare
Dear one
Here I am to share the fear
An act of kindness
Without an amen
How`s the heart
Underneath the silence?
How`s the one
Drowning in the mire?
Let us sound a human paean
Come in, the fire`s warm
Burn the rope and dance some more
We met where the cliff greets the sea
Shared a story, took the leap
Rose up rooted, hid a note
You know where
You`ve been there
Now there`s one who came from me
A child of light, another tale
Dear one
Night will come but not to stay
Why?
The answer`s in the
Fair winds my love
Fly towards the calm
Fly utterly lost
Towards a beating heart

How is that heart
Underneath the silence?
How is the one
Drowning in the mire?
Let us sound a human paean
Come on in, the fire`s warm
Dull the blade and dance some more3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

They came for him one winter's night
Arrested, he was bound
They said there'd been a robbery
His pistol had been found

They marched him to the station house
He waited for the dawn
And as they led him to the dock
He knew that he'd been wronged
"You stand accused of robbery" - he heard the bailiff say
He knew without an alibi
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom

Over the hills and far away
For ten long years he'll count the days
Over the mountains, and the seas
A prisoner's life for him there'll be

He knew that it would cost him dear
But yet he dare not say
Where he had been that fateful night
A secret it must stay
He had to fight back tears of rage
His heart beat like a drum
For with the wife of his best friend
He spent his final night of freedom
Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
Far from the mountains and the seas
Back in her arms is where he'll be
Over the hills and far away

Over the hills and, over the hills and
Over the hills and far away

Each night within his prison cell
He looks out through the bars
He reads the letters that she wrote
One day he'll know the taste of freedom

Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms he swears she'll be
Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
Far from the mountains and the seas
Back in her arms is where he'll be
Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms is where she'll be
Over the hills
Over the hills and far away
Over the hills
Over the hills and far awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It was the night before
When all through the world
No words, no dreams
Then one day
A writer by a fire
Imagined all of Gaia
Took a journey into a child-man's heart...
A painter on the shore
Imagined all the world
Within a snowflake on his palm
Unframed by poetry
A canvas of awe
Planet Earth falling back into the stars

I am the voice of Never, Never Land
The innocence, the dreams of every man
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky
Every chimney, every moonlit sight
I am the story that will read you real
Every memory that you hold dear

I am the journey
I am the destination
I am the home
The tale that reads you
A way to taste the night
The elusive high
Follow the madness
Alice you know once did
Imaginarium, a dream emporium!
Caress the tales
And they will dream you real
A storyteller's game
Lips that intoxicate
The core of all life
Is a limitless chest of tales...

I am the voice of Never, Never Land
The innocence, the dreams of every man
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky
Every chimney, every moonlit sight
I am the story that will read you real
Every memory that you hold dear

I am the voice of Never, Never Land
The innocence, the dreams of every man
Searching heavens for another earth...


Neverland, innocence, dreams of every man. A-ah-a!
Neverland, innocence, every man, Peter Pan
Neverland, innocence, dreams of every man. A-ah-a!
Neverland, innocence, every man, Peter Pan
I am the voice of Never, Never Land
The innocence, the dreams of every man
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky
Every chimney, every moonlit sight
I am the story that will read you real
Every memory that you hold dear6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel tonight

Deep into a dying day
I took a step outside an innocent heart
Prepare to hate me, fall when I may
This night will hurt you like never before

Old loves, they die hard
Old lies, they die harder

I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel
Your Virgin Mary undone
I'm in love with my lust
Burning angel wings to dust
I wish I had your angel tonight

I'm going down so frail and cruel
Drunken disguise changes all the rules
Old loves, they die hard
Old lies, they die harder

I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel
Your Virgin Mary undone
I'm in love with my lust
Burning angel wings to dust
I wish I had your angel tonight


Greatest thrill, not to kill
But to have the prize of the night
Hypocrite, wannabe friend
13th disciple who betrayed me for nothing!
Last dance, first kiss
Your touch, my bliss
Beauty always comes with dark thoughts

I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel
Your Virgin Mary undone

Burning angel wings to dust

Once there was a silent canvas
Sleeping stories unimagined
Birth of what if`s, hope and wonder
Winds will be named, words will shelter
Then, something wicked their way came
Showed a way to the Great Escape
Evoke the worlds, sparked the brain
An ape in awe before a door
To labyrinth
To Keystone Earth
To fallen stars
To there and back
We`re the writers
Of another way to be
We`re the writers
Of whatever we cry home
A moment alone
With unbeknown
Reset the world
Imagine home
A primal need
To touch the stars
Only way there
To enter
Imagine music, dance, illusion
Tales of Dust, of man in the moon
The Sea Lady, Snow, Glass, Apples
It is stories that built cathedrals
To lose yourself
To find who you are
Follow your tale, remember your name
Enter the woods

And bring back the Good

A feast of beautiful tragedy, wonderful fantasy
The play is yours to write
Yours to live

Sweet little words made for silence
Not talk
Young heart for love
Not heartache
Dark hair for catching the wind
Not to veil the sight of a cold world

Kiss while your lips are still red
While he`s still silent
Rest while bosom is still untouched, unveiled
Hold another hand while the hand`s still without a tool
Drown into eyes while they`re still blind
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn
First day of love never comes back
A passionate hour`s never a wasted one
The violin, the poet`s hand
Every thawing heart plays your theme with care

Kiss while your lips are still red
While he`s still silent
Rest while bosom is still untouched, unveiled
Hold another hand while the hand`s still without a tool
Drown into eyes while they`re still blind

In sleep he sang to me, in dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again? For now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there inside my mind

Sing once again with me, our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there inside your mind

Those who have seen your face draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear, it's me they hear
Your spirit and my voice in one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there inside my/your mind

Beware, the Phantom of the Opera

Where all your fantasies, you always knew
That man and mystery lay both in you

My harvest will come
A tiny valorous straw
Among the millions
Facing to the sun
I will pause before a man
Whose path has just begun
Something unsung our way comes
The quaternary code
Gave mankind a rose
So we could see the beautiful die
The strange peace of storm
Hovers over crops
And a child's face aglow before the scythe
Join the harvest of hundred fields
Hearty and tame
All going back to one single grain
Offer light to the coming day
Inspire a child
Water the field, surrender to the earth
They have beauty beyond all poetry
But choose a silent misery
The deeper their sea, the less remains
They'll find the pretty words
And tame flocks to herd
There's that, or a carousal of dare
Join the harvest of hundred fields
Hearty and tame
All going back to one single grain
Offer light to the coming day
Inspire a child
Water the field, surrender to the earth
Arrive alive1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

A cradle Earth, horizons unseen
New world in thirst, for the arcane
We are, singers of the gone
We remember, as along came life
A cradle Earth, horizons unseen
Birth of one, and a zillion sideshows
We are, we were, and will not be
We remember, as along came acorn
Another birth, another moss green
New world in thirst, for the unseen
An empty zoo, a starlight vigil
Will have a visit, as along came heartbeat
Another birth, another monster
Endless forms, towards the stronger
Menagerie, of a new world order
We held our breath, as along came suffering
We remember, father Pikaia
Gave the way, as along came Sapien
The cradle Earth, welcoming its newborn
Aeons since that very first acorn
Together now, in this timeless parade
The living lie, dead afraid
Then they saw the moon, and found caring
We remember, as along came writing
Such worlds were there, zoos dead again
After all, we should`ve never appeared
Spaceship Earth, through the fields of time
They understood, as along came wisdom
We have been here a while
At the end of Pi, as along came harvest
We will remember all the suffering
We wrote this in a tongue you will understand
Words and melodies with a touch of coloring
We were there and will remember mankind
