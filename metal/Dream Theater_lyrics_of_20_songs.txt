I never wanted to become someone like him, so secure
Content to live each day just like the last
I was sure I knew that this was not for me
And I wanted so much more
Far beyond what I could see
So I swore that I'd never be someone like him!
So many years have passed since I proclaimed
My independence, my mission
My aim and my vision, so secure
Content to live each day like it's my last
It's wonderful to know that I could be
Something more than what I dreamed
Far beyond what I could see
Still I swear that I'm missing out this time
As far as I could tell, there's nothing more I need
But still I ask myself, could this be everything?
Then all I swore, that I would never be was now
So suddenly, the only thing, I wanted to become
To be someone just like him

A doctor sitting next to me
He asks me how I feel
Not sure I understand his questioning
He says I've been away a while
But thinks he has cured me
From a state of catatonic sleep
For 30 years, where have I been?
Eyes open, but not getting through to me
Medicate me, infiltrate me
Side effects appear as my conscience slips away
Medicate me, science failing
Conscience fading fast, can't you stop what's happening?
A higher dosage he prescribes
But there's no guarantee
I feel it starting to take over me
I tell him not to be ashamed
There's no one who's to blame
A second shot, a brief awakening
I feel the relapse, can't break free
Eyes open, but not getting through to me
Medicate me, infiltrate me
Side effects appear, as my conscience slips away
Medicate me, science failing
Conscience fading fast, can't you stop what's happening?


Sailing on the seven seize the day tripper diem's ready
Jack the ripper Owens Wilson Phillips and my supper's ready
Lucy in the sky with diamond Dave's not here I come to save the
Day for nightmare cinema show me the way to get back home again
(Running forward, falling back) Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in) Scream without a sound
(Leaning over, crawling up) Stumbling all around
(Losing my place, only to) Find I've come full circle
Flying off the handle be careful with
That axe Eugene gene the dance machine
Messiah light my fire gabba gabba
Hey hey my my generation's home again
(Running forward, falling back) Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in) Scream without a sound
(Leaning over, crawling up) Stumbling all around
(Losing my place, only to) Find I've come full circle


Root, our deadly sins feel his mortal wrath
Remove all obstacles from our path
Second, asking questions, search for clues
The answer's been right in front of you
Third, try to break through, long to connect
Fall on deaf ears and failed muted breath
Fourth, loyalty, trust, faith and desire
Carries love through each darkest fire
Fifth, tortured Insanity, a smothering hell
Try to escape but no avail
Sixth, the calls of admirers who claim they adore
Drain all your lifeblood while begging for more
Seventh, innocent victims of merciless crimes
Fall prey to some madmen's impulsive designs
Octave, step after step, we try controlling our fate
When we finally start living it has become too late
Trapped inside this Octavarium!
Trapped inside this Octavarium!
Trapped inside this Octavarium!
Trapped inside this Octavarium!

We move in circles
Balanced all the while
On a gleaming razor's edge
A perfect sphere colliding with our fate
This story ends where it began!

Where did we come from
Why are we here?
Where do we go when we die?
What lies beyond
And what lay before
Is anything certain in life?
They say "Life is too short"
"The here and the now"
And "You`re only given one shot."
But could there be more
Have I lived before
Or could this be all that we`ve got?

If I die tomorrow
I`d be alright
Because I believe
That after we`re gone
The spirit carries on
I used to be frightened of dying
I used to think death was the end
But that was before
I`m not scared anymore
I know that my soul will transcend!
I may never find all the answers
I may never understand why
I may never prove
What I know to be true
But I know that I still have to try!

If I die tomorrow
I`d be alright
Because I believe
That after we`re gone
The spirit carries on

"Move on, be brave
Don`t weep at my grave
Because I`m no longer here
But please never let
Your memory of me disappear!"

Safe in the light that surrounds me
Free of the fear and the pain
My questioning mind
Has helped me to find
The meaning in my life again
Victoria`s real
I finally feel
At peace with the girl in my dreams
And now that I`m here
It`s perfectly clear
I found out what all of this means!
If I die tomorrow
I`d be alright
Because I believe
That after we`re gone
The spirit carries on5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Lost in the sky
Clouds roll by and I roll with them
Arrows fly
Seas increase and then fall again

This world is spinning around me
This world is spinning without me and
Every day sends future to past
Every breath leaves me one less to my last

Watch the sparrow falling
Gives new meaning to it all
If not today nor yet tomorrow
Then some other day
I'll take seven lives for one
And then my only father's son
As sure as I did ever love him
I am not afraid

This world is spinning around me
The whole world keeps spinning around me
All life is future to past
Every breath leaves me one less to my last
Pull me under, pull me under
Pull me under, I'm not afraid
All that I feel is honor and spite
All I can do is to set it right

Dust fills my eyes
Clouds roll by and I roll with them
Centuries cry
Orders fly and I fall again

This world is spinning inside me
The whole world is spinning inside of me
Every day sends future to past
Every step brings me closer to my last

Pull me under, pull me under
Pull me under, I'm not afraid
Living my life too much in the sun
Only until your will is done

Pull me under, pull me under
Pull me under, I'm not afraid
All that I feel is honor and spite
All I can do is set it right
Pull me under, pull me under
Pull me under, I'm not afraid
Living my life too much in the sun
Only until your will is done




Oh that this too
Too solid flesh
Would melt4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You are once again surrounded by a brilliant white light. Allow the light to lead you away from your past and into this lifetime. As the light dissipates you will slowly fade back into consciousness, remembering all you have learned. When I tell you to open your eyes, you will return to the present, feeling peaceful and refreshed
Open your eyes, Nicholas

Friday evening
The blood still on my hands
To think that she would leave me now
For that ungrateful man
Sole survivor
No witness to the crime
I must act fast to cover up
I think that there`s still time
He'd seem hopeless and lost with this note
They'll buy into the words that I wrote:
"This feeling inside me!
Finally found my love, I've finally broke free
No longer torn in two!
I'd take my own life before losing you!"

Feeling good this Friday afternoon
I ran into Julian
Said we'd get together soon
He's always had my heart
He needs to know
I'll break free of the Miracle
It's time for him to go
This feeling inside me!
Finally found my love, I've finally broke free
No longer torn in two!
He'd kill his brother if he only knew

Their love renewed
They'd rendezvous
In a pathway out of view
They thought no one knew
Then came a shot out of the night
Open your eyes, Victoria!

One last time
We'll lay down today
One last time
Until we fade away
One last time
We'll lay down today
One last time
We fade away

As their bodies lie still
And the ending draws near
Spirits rise through the air
All their fears disappear
It all becomes clear
A blinding light comes into view
An old soul exchanged for a new
Familiar voice comes shining through

This feeling inside me!
Finally found my life, I'm finally free
No longer torn in two!
I learned about my life by living through you
This feeling inside me!
Finally found my life, I'm finally free
No longer torn in two!
Living my own life by learning from you
We'll meet again my friend!
Someday soon
"News in London, France, Russia and Italy have deleted their lead story
All anticipating the outcome of the man considered to be a member of American nobility
And as you can imagine, as the skies have grown darker
Here over Washington
The mood has grown darker as well and people here are
Beginning to resign themselves to the possibility that they are
Witnessing yet another tragedy in a long string of misfortunes
Reaction from everywhere, from Washington and certainly
From around the world has guess..."

"Open your eyes, Nicholas!"

"AAAH!"7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

All wound up, on the edge, terrified
Sleep disturbed, restless mind, petrified
Bouts of fear permeate all I see
Heightening nervousness threatens me

I am paralyzed
So afraid to die

Caught off guard, warning signs never show
Tension strikes, choking me, worries grow

Why do I feel so numb?
Is it something to do with where I come from?
Should this be fight or flight?
I don't know why I'm constantly so uptight

Rapid heartbeat pounding through my chest
Agitated body in distress
I feel like I'm in danger
Daily life is strangled by my stress
A stifling surge shooting through all my veins
Extreme apprehension, suddenly I'm insane
Lost all hope for redemption
A grave situation desperate at best
Why do I feel so numb?
Is it something to do with where I come from?
Should this be fight or flight?
I don't know why I'm constantly reeling

Helpless hysteria
A false sense of urgency
Trapped in my phobia
Possessed by anxiety
Run, try to hide
Overwhelmed by this complex delirium

I remember a time
My frail, virgin mind
Watched the crimson sunrise
Imagined what it might find
Life was filled with wonder
I felt the warm wind blow
I must explore the boundaries
Transcend the depth of winter's snow
Innocence caressing me
I never felt so young before
There was so much life in me
Still I longed to search for more
But those days are gone now
Changed like a leaf on a tree
Blown away forever
Into the cool autumn breeze
The snow has now fallen
And my sun's not so bright
I struggle to hold on
With the last of my might
In my den of inequity
Viciousness and subtlety
Struggle to ease the pain
Struggle to find the same
Ignorance surrounding me
I've never been so filled with fear
All my life's been drained from me
The end is drawing near...
"Carpe diem
Seize the day..."
I'll always remember
The chill of November
The news of the fall, the sounds in the hall
The clock on the wall ticking away!
"Seize the Day!," I heard him say
"Life will not always be this way
Look around, hear the sounds
Cherish your life while you're still around"
("Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
(Old Time is still a-flying;)
(And this same flower that smiles today)
(Tomorrow will be dying")
We can learn from the past
But those days are gone
We can hope for the future
But there may not be one
The words stuck in my mind
Alive from what I've learned
I have to seize the day
To home I returned
Preparing for her flight
I held with all my might
Fearing my deepest fright
She walked into the night
She turned for one last look
She looked me in the eye
I said, "I Love You... Good-bye!"
("It's the most awful thing you'll ever hear;)
(Your mom... who you dearly love...)
(Has had to leave... all our lives")
("Seize the day!")
("Something happened")
("Gather ye rosebuds while ye may")
("She was killed")


So far or so it seems
All is lost with nothing fulfilled
Off the pages and the T.V. screen
Another world where nothing's true
Tripping through the life fantastic
Lose a step and never get up
Left alone with a cold blank stare
I feel like giving up
I was blinded by a paradise
Utopia high in the sky
A dream that only drowned me
Deep in sorrow, wondering why
Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what, don't let him be
Let's feed upon his misery
Then string him up for all the world to see!
I'm sick of all you hypocrites holding me at bay
And I don't need your sympathy to get me through the day
Seasons change and so can I!
Hold on Boy, no time to cry
Untie these strings, I'm climbing down
I won't let them push me away!
Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what, don't let him be
Let's feed upon his misery
Now it's time for them
To deal with me!



I'm much wiser now
A lifetime of memories run through my head
They taught me how
For better or worse
Alive or dead
I realize there's no turning back
Life goes on the offbeaten track
I sit down with my son
Set to see the Crimson Sunset
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
Many years have come and gone
I've lived my life, but now must move on
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
He's my only one
Now that my time has come
Now that my life is done
We look into the sun
"Seize the day and don't you cry
Now it's time to say good-bye
Even though I'll be gone
I will live on
Live on!"10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The smile of dawn arrived early May
She carried a gift from her home
The night shed a tear to tell her of fear
And of sorrow and pain, she'll never outgrow

Death is the first dance, eternal

There's no more freedom
The both of you will be confined
To this mind

I was told there's a miracle for each day that I try
I was told there's a new love that's born for each one that has died
I was told there'd be no one to call on when I feel alone and afraid
I was told if you dream of the next world
You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire

As a child, I thought I could live without pain, without sorrow
As a man, I've found it's all caught up with me
I'm asleep, yet I'm so afraid
Somewhere like a scene from a memory
There's a picture worth a thousand words
Eluding stares the faces before me
It hides away and will never be heard of again

Deceit is the second without end

The city's cold blood teaches us to survive
Just keep my heart in your eyes and we'll stay alive
The third arrives...

Before the leaves have fallen
Before we lock the doors
There must be the third and last dance
This one will last forever
Metropolis watches and thoughtfully smiles
She's taken you to your home

It can only take place
When the struggle between our children has ended
Now the Miracle and the Sleeper know
That the third is love
Love is the Dance of Eternity!4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Shine-lake of fire!
Lines take me higher!
My mind drips desire
Confined and overtired
Living this charade
Is getting me nowhere
I can’t shake this charade
The city’s cold blood calls me home
Home! it’s what I long for
Back home where I belong!
The city, it calls to me
Decadent scenes from my memory
Sorrow, eternity
My demons are coming to drown me
Help! I’m falling, I’m crawling
I can’t keep away from its clutch
Can’t have it, this habit
It’s calling me back to my home

I remember the first time she came to me
She poured her soul out all night and cried
I remember I was told there’s a new love that’s born
For each one that has died
I never thought that I
Could carry on with this life
But I can’t resist myself
No matter how hard I try!
Living their other life
Is getting them nowhere
I’ll make her my wife!
Her sweet temptation calls me home
Home! It’s what I long for
My home, where she belongs!
Her ecstasy means so much to me
Even deceiving my own blood
Victoria watches and thoughtfully smiles
She’s taking me to my home
Help! he’s my brother, but I love her
I can’t keep away from her touch
Deception, dishonor
It’s calling me back to my home
Her story, it holds the key
Unlocking dreams from my memory
Solving this mystery
Is everything that is a part of me
Help! Regression, obsession
I can’t keep away from her touch
Leave no doubt, to find out
It’s calling me back to my home1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Subconscious strange sensation
Unconscious relaxation
What a pleasant nightmare
And I can't wait to get there again
Every time I close my eyes
There's another vivid surprise
Another whole life waiting
Chapters unfinished, fading

Closer now - Slowly coming into view
I've arrived - Blinding sunshine beaming through

There's a house I'm drawn to
Familiar settings, nothing new
There's a pathway leading there
With a haunting chill in the air
There's room at the top of the stairs
Every night I'm drawn up there
There's a girl in the mirror
Her face is getting clearer
Young child, won't you tell me why I'm here?
In her eyes - I sense a story never told
Behind the disguise - There's something tearing
At her soul

Tonight I've been searching for it
A feeling that's deep inside me
Tonight I've been searching for
The one that nobody knows
Trying to break free!
I just can't help myself
I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head
Tears my heart into two
I'm not the one the sleeper thought he knew


Back on my feet again
Eyes open to real world
Metropolis surrounds me
The mirror's shattered the girl
Why is this other life
Haunting me everyday?
I'd break through the other side
If only I'd find the way
Something's awfully familiar
The feeling's so hard to shake
Could I have lived in that other world
It's a link that I'm destined to make
I'm still searching but I don't know what for
The missing key to unlock my mind's door

Today I am searching for it
A feeling that won't go away
Today I am searching for
The one that I only know
Trying to break free!
I just can't help myself
I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head
Tears my soul into two
I'm not the one I thought I always knew
I just can't help myself
I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head
Uncanny, strange Deja Vu
But I don't mind - I hope to find the truth3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In a dark and lonely corner
Of a time-worn dockside inn
Sits the local barstool warrior
Talking to his gin
Tracing past decisions
He motions for a shot
Is he doomed to be a man this world forgot?
Just a prisoner of the monster on his back

Call it bad luck, call it fate
Call it stuck here the rest of my days
Serves me right
What went wrong?
And where do I belong?

In the glow of flashing lights
On the shoulder of the road
Clutching at the bruises on her skin
She tries to signal danger
With anguish in her eyes
Will he see the world of pain she's in?
Or is it too late?
Was it bad luck? Was it fate?
Or a past that she couldn't escape?
It's not right, something's wrong
Just where do I belong?


Promises made, crying in vain, all empty
Never accepting the blame
And not letting go of the shame
A river of tears as months turn to years, all wasted
On someone not willing to change
Now only a shadow remains
No one can save you
And there's no one to save
It has been written
You will become all you think
All you feel, all you dream

Now I'm cutting the anchor away
And I won't look back
I'm starting a new life today
Now I see where I belong10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You've built this world around you, your universe
In spite of best intentions, things could not be worse
Chaos and fear have left you hanging by a thread
As you argue with the voice inside your head

Untethered angel
Falling into darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Giving up yourself won't set you free

Misgiving and dismay, nightmares of wasted days
Can't live your life this way, something needs to change
Cold feet and second thoughts; entangled, tied in knots
Avoidance at all costs, a painful thing to watch

Fear can live inside you
Push you to the edge
Face the fear within you
Wake up from the dead

Untethered angel
Falling into darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Giving up yourself won't set you free
Set you free
Untethered angel
Falling into darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Open your heart, be set free7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Live another day
Climb a little higher
Find another reason to stay
Ashes in your hands
Mercy in your eyes
If you're searching for a silent sky...

You won't find it here
Look another way
You won't find it here
So die another day


The coldness of his words
The message in his silence
"Face the candle to the wind..."
This distance in my voice
Isn't leaving you a choice
So if you're looking for a time to run away...

You won't find it here
Look another way
You won't find it here
So try another day
They took pictures of our dreams
Ran to hide behind the stairs
And said, "Maybe when it's right for you, they'll fall"
But if they don't come down
Resist the need to pull them in and throw them away
Better to save the mystery
Than surrender to the secret


You won't find it here
Look another way
You won't find it here
So try another day

Falling through pages of Martens on angels
Feeling my heart pull west
I saw the future dressed as a stranger
Love in a space-dye vest
Love is an act of blood and I'm bleeding
A pool in the shape of a heart
Beauty projection in the reflection
Always the worst way to start

"But he's the sort who can't know anyone intimately, least of all a woman. He doesn't know what a woman is. He wants you for a possession, something to look at like a painting or an ivory box. Something to own and to display. He doesn't want you to be real, or to think, or to live. He doesn't love you, but I love you. I want you to have your own thoughts and ideas and feelings, even when I hold you in my arms. It's our last chance... It's our last chance..."

Now that you're gone I'm trying to take it
Learning to swallow the rage
Found a new girl I think we can make it
As long as she stays on the page
This is not how I want it to end
And I'll never be open again

"...I was gonna move out...ummm...get, get a job, get my own place, ummm. But...I go into the mall where I want to work and they tell me, I'm, I was too young..."
"Some people gave advice before about facing the facts, about facing reality. And this is, this without a doubt, is his biggest challenge ever. He's going to have to face it. You're going to have to try, he's gonna to have to try and uh, and, and, and get some help here. I mean no one can say they know how he feels."

"That, so they say that, in ya know like, Houston or something, you'd say it's a hundred and eighty degrees. But it's a dry heat. In Houston they say that? Oh, maybe not. I'm all mixed up. Dry until they hit the swimming pool."

"...I get up with the sun... Listen. You have your own room to sleep in. I don't care what you do. I don't care when. That door gets locked. That door gets locked at night by nine o'clock. If you're not in this house by nine o'clock, then you'd better find some place to sleep. Because you're not going to be a bum in this house. Supper is ready..."

There's no one to take my blame
If they wanted to
There's nothing to keep me sane
And it's all the same to you
There's nowhere to set my aim
So I'm everywhere
Never come near me again
Do you really think I need you?
I'll never be open again
I could never be open again
I'll never be open again
I could never be open again

And I'll smile and I'll learn to pretend
And I'll never be open again
And I'll have no more dreams to defend
And I'll never be open again8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Alone at night, I feel so strange
I need to find all the answers to my dreams
When I sleep at night, I hear the cries
What does this mean?

I shut the door and traveled to another home
I met an older man, he seemed to be alone
I felt that I could trust him, he talked to me that night:

"Lad, did you know a girl was murdered here?
This fatal tragedy was talked about for years!"
Victoria's gone forever, only memories remain!
She passed away, she was so young

Without love, without truth
There can be no turning back!
Without faith, without hope
There can be no peace of mind!

As the night went on, I started to find my way
I learned about a tragedy, a mystery still today
I tried to get more answers, but he said, "You're on your own"
Then he turned away and left me as I stood there all alone
He said, "You'll know the truth as your future days unfold"
Without love, without truth
There can be no turning back!
Without faith, without hope
There can be no peace of mind!

Remember that death is not the end, but only a transition."2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Let me help you, how much longer until you realize?
You're getting worse
It's killing you inside
I can't break through
Feel you have to face this on your own
Want to be left alone

Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
I know that it's tearing you apart
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
Come alive

You feel I'm asking too much of you but can't let go
Fear breeds the hate and your apathy, empty and hollow
You lost your faith, there's no getting through
Why shut me out?
Frantic, disturbed, filled with misery, can't figure it out

Sleepless, worse for wear, staring at the ceiling
Numb, sedated, intoxicated
Deafening, deafening
Shut it out, shut it out
Burning, burning
No way out, no way out

Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
I know that it's tearing you apart
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
Come alive


Asked me to listen
Can't go on and face another day
I lied, not admitting
What I lost is still in you
Something's missing
You see darkness in my eyes
Maculate, there is no cure
Playing over, stop pretending
Warped inside its never ending tide

Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
Don't leave me now3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Don't tell me what's in, tell me how to write
Don't tell me how to win
This fight isn't your life, it isn't your right
To take the only thing that's mine
Proven over time, it's over your head
Don't try to read between the
Lines are clearly defined!
"Never lose sight of something you believe in"

Taking in the view from the outside
Feeling like the underdog
Watching through the window I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog!

I've been trying to justify you
In the end I will just defy you

To those who understand, I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand, take me as I am
Not under your command, I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan, take me as I am!
As I am!
Still running uphill, swimming against the current
I wish I weren't so fucked
Feels like I'm stuck
Lost in a sea of mediocrity
''Slow down! You're thinking too much. Where is your soul?''
You cannot touch the way I play
Or tell me what to say
You're in the way of all that I believe in

Taking in the view from the outside
Feeling like the underdog
Watching through the window I'm on the outside
Living like the underdog!

I've been wasting my breath on you
Open minds will descend upon you

To those who understand, I extend my hand
To the doubtful I demand, take me as I am
Not under your command, I know where I stand
I won't change to fit your plan, take me as I am!

Several years ago
In a foreign town
Far away from home
I met the Count of Tuscany
A young, eccentric man
Bred from royal blood
Took me for a ride
Across the open countryside
Get into my car
Let's go for a drive
Along the way, I'll be your guide
Just step inside
Maybe you recall
A cannibal curator
A character inspired by
My brother's life
Winding through the hills
The city far behind
On and on we drove
Down narrow streets and dusty roads
At last we came upon
A picturesque estate
On sprawling emerald fields
An ancient world of times gone by

Let me introduce
My brother
A bearded gentleman
Historian
Sucking on his pipe
Distinguished accent
Making me uptight
No accident

I want to stay alive
Everything about this place
Just doesn't feel right
I
I don't want to die
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life
I want to say goodbye
This could be the last time
You see me alive
I
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived
Would you like to see
Our secret holy place?
I come here late at night
To pray to him by candlelight
Then peering through the glass
I saw with disbelief
Still dressed in royal clothes
The saint behind the altar
History recalls
During times of war
Legend has been traced
Back inside these castle walls
Where soldiers came to hide
In barrels filled with wine
Never to escape
These tombs of oak are where they died

Down the cellar stairs
I disappear
Like the English heir
The end is near
Come and have a taste
A rare vintage
All the finest wines
Improve with age

I want to stay alive
Everything about this place
Just doesn't feel right
I
I don't want to die
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life
I want to say goodbye
This could be the last time
You see me alive
I
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived


Could this be the end?
Is this the way I die?
Sitting here alone
No one by my side
I don't understand
I don't feel that I deserve this
What did I do wrong?
I just don't understand
Give me one more chance
Let me please explain
It's all been circumstance
I'll tell you once again
You took me for a ride
Promising a vast adventure
Next thing that I know
I'm frightened for my life

"Now wait a minute, man!
That's not how it is!
You must be confused
That isn't who I am
Please don't be afraid
I would never try to hurt you
This is how we live
Strange although it seems
Please try to forgive!
The chapel and the saint
The soldiers and the wine
The fables and the tales
All handed down through time
Of course you're free to go
Go and tell the world my story
Tell about my brother, tell them about me...
The Count of Tuscany!"7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Headline: "Murder, young girl killed
Desperate shooting at Echo's hill
Dreadful ending, killer died
Evidently suicide"
A witness heard a horrifying sound
He ran to find a woman dead and
Lying on the ground
Standing by her was a man
Nervous, shaking, gun in hand
Witness says he tried to help
But he'd turned the weapon on himself
His body fell across that poor young girl
After shouting out in vain
The witness ran to call for assistance
A sad close to a broken love affair
Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are
Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are
She wanted love forever
But he had another plan
He fell into an evil way
She had to let him down
She said "I can't love a wayward man"
She may have found a reason to forgive (oh yeah, yeah)
If he had only tried to change
Was their fatal meeting prearranged?
Had a violent struggle taken place?
There was every sign that lead there
Witness found a switchblade on the ground
Was the victim unaware?
They continued to investigate
They found a note in the killer's pocket
It could have been a suicide letter
Maybe he had lost her love
"I feel there's only one thing left to do
I'd sooner take my life away than live with losing you"
Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are
Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are
All that we learn this time (What we have been is what we are)
Is carried beyond this life
All that we learn this time (What we have been is what we are)
Is carried beyond this life

Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are
Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are
All that we learn this time (What we have been is what we are)
Is carried beyond this life
All that we learn this time (What we have been is what we are)
Is carried beyond this life1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She can't stop pacing
She never felt so alive
Her thoughts are racing
Set on overdrive
It takes a village
This she knows is true
They're expecting her
And she's got work to do
He helplessly stands by
It's meaningless to try
As he rubs his red-rimmed eyes
He says "I've never seen her get this bad"
Even though she seems so high
He knows that she can't fly
And when she falls out of the sky
He'll be standing by
She was raised in a small midwestern town
By a charming and eccentric loving father
She was praised as the perfect teenage girl
And everyone thought highly of her
And she tried everyday
With endless drive
To make the grade
Then one day
She woke up to find
The perfect girl
Had lost her mind
Once barely taking a break
Now she sleeps the days away
She helplessly stands by
It's meaningless to try
All she wants to do is cry
No one ever knew she was so sad
Cause even though she gets so high
And thinks that she can fly
She will fall out of the sky
But in the face of misery
She found hopefulness
Feeling better
She had weathered
This depression
Much to her advantage
She resumed her frantic pace
Boundless power
Midnight hour
She enjoyed the race


Napalm showers
Showed the cowards
We weren't there to mess around
Through heat exhaustion
And mind distortion
A military victory mounted on innocent ground

Hearing voices from miles away
Saying things never said
Seeing shadows in the light of the day
Waging a war inside my head
Years and years of
Bloodshed and warfare
Our mission was only to get in and kill
A free vacation
Of palmtrees and shrapnel
Trading innocence for permanent psychotic hell


Feeling strangers staring my way
Reading minds never read
Tasting danger with each word I say
Waging a war inside my...


Standing in the darkness
Waiting for the light
The smell of pure adrenaline
Burning in the night
Random blinding flashes
Aiming at the stage
Intro tape begins to roll
Igniting sonic rage
Still they keep me between these hollow walls
Hoping to find in me
The answers to the test that stumped them all
"The boy is simply crazy
Suffering from delusions
We honestly think that maybe
He might need an institution
He lives in a world of fiction
And really could use some help
We have just the place to fix him
To save him from himself!"
Curled up in the darkness
Searching for the light
The smell of stale sweat and shit
Streaming through the night
Random urine testing
Pills red, pink and blue
Counseling and therapy
Providing not a clue
Still they keep me between these hollow walls
Hoping to find in me
The answers to the test that stumped them all
"We can't seem to find the answers
He seemed such a clear cut case
We cannot just let him leave here
And put all this work to waste
Why don't we try shock treatment
It really might do some help?
We have just the tools to fix him
To save him from himself!"


Goodnight kiss in your nightgown
Lavender in your bed
So innocent as you lie down
Sweet dreams that run through your head
Are you lonely without mommy's love?
I want you to know I'd die for that moment
You're just a poor girl
Afraid of this cruel world
Taken away from it all
It's been 5 years to the day and
My tainted blood's still the same
I can't help acting this way and
Those bastard doctors are gonna pay
I'm so lonely without baby's love
I want you to know I'd die for one more moment
I'm just a poor girl
Afraid of this cruel world
Taken away from it all


He seemed no different from the rest
Just a healthy normal boy
His mama always did her best
And he was daddy's pride and joy
He learned to walk and talk on time
But never cared much to be held
And steadily he would decline
Into his solitary shell
As a boy he was considered somewhat odd
Kept to himself most of the time
He would daydream in and out of his own world
But in every other way he was fine
He's a Monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell
A temporary catatonic
Madman on occasion
When will he break out
Of his solitary shell?
He struggled to get through his day
He was helplessly behind
He poured himself onto the page
Writing for hours at a time
As a man he was a danger to himself
Fearful and sad most of the time
He was drifting in and out of sanity
But in every other way he was fine
He's a Monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell
A momentary maniac
With casual delusions
When will he be let out
Of his solitary shell?


I'm alive again
The darkness far behind me
I'm invincible
Despair will never find me
I feel strong
I've got a new sense of elation
Boundless energy
Euphoria fixation
Still it's hard to just get by
It seems so meaningless to try
When all I want to do is cry
Who would ever know I felt so sad?
Even though I get so high
I know that I will never fly
And when I fall out of the sky
Who'll be standing by?
Will you be standing by?


She dresses in black everyday
She keeps her hair simple and plain
She never wears makeup
But no one would care if she did anyway
She doesn't recall yesterday
Faces seem twisted and strange
But she always wakes up
Only to find she'd been miles away
Absence of awareness
Losing time
A lapse of perception
Losing time
Wanting to escape
She had created a way to survive
She learned to detach from herself
A behavior that kept her alive
Hope in the face of our human distress
Helps us to understand the turbulence deep inside
That takes hold of our lives
Shame and disgrace over mental unrest
Keeps us from saving those we love
The grace within our hearts
And the sorrow in our souls
Deception of fame
Vengeance of war
Lives torn apart
Losing oneself
Spiraling down
Feeling the walls closing in
A journey to find
The answers inside
Our elusive mind4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

How can this be?
Why is he the chosen one?
Saint gone astray
With a scepter and a gun

Learn to believe
In the mighty and the strong
Come bleed the beast
Follow me, it won't be long

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God!
Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God!

Straight is the path
Leading to your salvation
Slaying the weak
Ethnic elimination
Any day we'll all be
Swept away
You'll be saved
As long as you obey

Lies
Tools of the devil inside
Written in holy disguise
Meant to deceive and divide
Us all

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God!
Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God!

Blurring the lines
Between virtue and sin
They can't tell
Where God ends
And mankind begins
They know no other
Life but this
From the cradle
They are claimed
Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God!
Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God!

Hundreds of believers
Lured into a doomsday cult
All would perish
In the name of God
Self-proclaimed messiah
Led his servants
To their death
Eighty murdered
In the name of God

Forty sons and daughters
Un-consenting plural wives
Perversions
In the name of God
Underground religion
Turning toward
The mainstream light
Blind devotion
In the name of God
Justifying violence
Citing from the holy book
Teaching hatred
In the name of God

Listen when the prophet
Speaks to you
Killing in the name of God!
Passion
Twisting faith into violence
In the name of God!

Religious beliefs
Fanatic obsession
Does following faith
Lead us to violence?
Unyielding crusade
Divine revelation
Does following faith
Lead us to violence?

Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord
He is trampling out the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are stored
He hath loosed the fateful lightning
Of his terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah...5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
