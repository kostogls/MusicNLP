Ghost of Mother lingering death
Ghost on Mother's bed
Black strands on the pillow contour of her health
Twisted face upon the head
Ghost of perdition stuck in her chest
A warning no one read
Tragic friendship called inside the fog
Pouring venom brew deceiving

Devil cracked the earthly shell foretold she was the one
Blew hope into the room and said
"You have to live before you die young"
Devil cracked the earthly shell foretold she was the one
Blew hope into the room and said
"You have to live before you die young"

Holding her down channeling darkness
Hemlock for the Gods
Fading resistance, draining the weakness
Penetrating inner light

Road into the dark unaware
Winding ever higher

Darkness by her side spoke and passed her by
Dedicated hunter waits to pull us under
Rose up to its call, in his arms she'd fall
Mother light received, a faithful servant's free

In time the hissing of her sanity
Faded out her voice and soiled her name
Like the marked pages in a diary
Everything seemed clean that is unstained
The incoherent talk of ordinary days
Why would we really need to live?
Decide what's clear and what's within a haze
What you should take and what to give

Ghost of perdition
A saint's premonition's unclear
Keeper of holy hordes
Keeper of holy whores

To see a beloved son in despair of what's to come
If one cut the source of the flow and everything would change
Would conviction fall in the shadow of the righteous?
The phantasm of your mind might be calling you to go
Defying the forgotten morals where the victim is the prey16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I am a sinner and I worship evil
Blood is thinner but you will never know
Can you confess that you thrive in chaos?
You're a sorceress and your eye is on the lost
But you're dying
It's in your eyes

You're a charlatan, you get everything you wish
You're a harlot, carry poison in your kiss
Beg forgiveness with a dagger in your hand
Sow your death seed and reap the dying lands
But you're crying
It's only vice

Empty vessel
Drained of hope
And none the lesser at the end of
A rope
Have you ever hated like I?
Know I still awaited the absence of lies
Watch your eager tongue
Attack me from behind

Riddle whispers, bleak futile control
Like a twin sister adapting to a role
You're a murderer, bloodlust increase
You're a harvester, come close to spread disease
And you're hiding
I hear you cry3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
***
I can't see the meaning of this life I'm leading
I try to forget you as you forgot me
This time there is nothing left for you to take
This is goodbye

Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay

And I should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I should step out of the rain
Turn away

Close to ending it all, I am drifting through the stages
Of the rapture born within this loss
Thoughts of death inside
Tear me apart from the core of my soul

Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay
And I should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I should step out of the rain
Turn away

At times, the dark's fading slowly
But it never sustains
Would someone watch over me
In my time of need?

Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay

And I should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I should step out of the rain
Turn away12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Stay with me awhile
Rise above the vile
Name my final rest
Poured into my chest

Into the orchard I walk, peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
Halo of death, all I see is departure
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr

Pledge yourself to me
Never leave me be
Sweat breaks on my brow
Given time ends now

Into the orchard I walk, peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
Halo of death, all I see is departure
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr
Spirit painted sin
Embers neath my skin
Veiled in pale embrace
Reached and touched my face

Into the orchard I walk, peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
(Release your grip, let me go, into the night)
Halo of death, All I see is departure
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Confessor of the tragedies in man
Lurking in the core of us all
The last dying call for the ever lost
Brief encounters, bleeding pain

Lepers coiled neath the trees
Dying men in bewildered soliloquies
Perversions bloom around the bend
Seekers, lost in their quest
Ghosts of friends frolic under the waning moon
It is the year of death
Wielding his instruments
Stealth sovereign reaper
Touching us with ease
Infecting the roots in an instant
Burning crop of disease
I am just a spectator
An advocate documenting the loss
Fluttering with conceit
This doesn't concern me yet
Still far from the knell
Taunting their bereavement
Mob round the dead
Point fingers at the details
Probing vomits for more
Caught in unbridled suspense
We have all lost it now
Catching the flakes of dismay
Born the travesty of man
Regular pulse midst pandemonium
You're plucked to the mass
Parched with thirst for the wicked
Sick liaisons raised this monumental mark
The sun sets forever over Blackwater Park

Beating
Heart still beating for the cause
Feeding
Soul still feeding from the loss
Aching
Limbs are aching from the rush
Fading
You are fading from my sight

Break of morning, coldness lingers on
Shroud me into nightmares of the sun

Moving
I am moving closer to your side
Luring
You are luring me into the night
Crying
Who is crying for you here
Dying
I am dying fast inside your tears

Plunging towards bereavement faster yet
Clearing thoughts, my mind is set
Devious movements in your eyes
Moved me from relief
Breath comes out white clouds with your lies
And filters through me

You're close to the final word
You're staring right past me in dismay
A liquid seeps from your chest
And drains me away

Mist ripples round your thin white neck
And draws me a line
Cold fingers mark this dying wreck
This moment is mine

Help me cure you
Atone for all you've done
Help me leave you
As all the days are gone

Devious movements in your eyes
Moved me from relief
Breath comes out white clouds with your lies
And filters through me

You're close to the final word
You're staring right past me in dismay
A liquid seeps from your chest
And drains me away

Mist ripples round your thin white neck
And draws me a line
Cold fingers mark this dying wreck
This moment is mine

Night falls again
Taking what’s left of me

Slight twist, shivering corpse
Ornated with water, fills the cracks
Clasped in my limbs by tradition
This is all you need7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Blank face in the windowpane
Made clear in seconds of light
Disappears and returns again
Counting hours, searching the night

Might be waiting for someone
Might be there for us to see
Might be in need of talking
Might be staring directly at me

Inside plays a lullaby
Slurred voice over children cry
On the
Inside

Haunting loneliness in the eye
Skin covering a secret scar
His hand is waving a goodbye
There's no response or action returned

There is deep prejudice in me
Outshines all reason inside
Given dreams all ridden with pain
And projected unto the last5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
***
Please remedy my confusion
And thrust me back to the day
The silence of your seclusion
Brings night into all you say

Pull me down again
And guide me into pain

I'm counting nocturnal hours
Drowned visions in haunted sleep
Faint flickering of your powers
Leaks out to show what you keep

Pull me down again
And guide me into...

There is failure inside
This test I can't persist
Kept back by the enigma
No criteria is demanded here
Deadly patterns made my wreath
Prosperous in your ways
Pale ghost in the corner
Pouring a caress on your shoulder
Puzzled by shrewd innocence runs a thick tide beneath
Ushered into inner graves, nails bleeding from the struggle
It is the end for the weak at heart, always the same
A lullaby for the ones who've lost all reeling inside
My gleaming eye in your necklace reflects stare of primal regrets
You turn your back and you walk away, never again

Spiraling to the ground below like Autumn leaves left in the wake to fade away
Waking up to your sound again and lapse into the ways of misery3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
***
I once upon a time carried a burden inside
I sung a last goodbye, a broken rhyme I'd underlined
There's an ocean of sorrow in you

Sorrow in me

Saw a movement in their eyes
Said, I no longer knew the way
Given up the ghost, a passive mind submit to fear
And the wait for redemption at hand

Waiting to fail


Failing again

If death should take me now
Count my mistakes and let me through
Whisper in my ear, you've taken more than we've received
And the ocean of sorrow is you


*Distorted Laughing*9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I am awaiting
The sunrise
Gazing modestly through the coldest morning
Once it came you lied
Embracing us over
Autumn's proud treetops
I stand motionless
In a parade of falling rain
Your voice I cannot hear
As I am falling again
Devotion eludes
And in sadness I lumber
In my own ashes
I am standing without a soul
She wept and whispered:
"I know..."
We walked into the night
Am I
To bid you farewell?
Why can't you see
That I try?
When every tear I shed
Is for you?12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We entered Winter once again
Naked, freezing from my breath
Neath the lid all limbs tucked away
This coffin is your abode from now and onwards

Your body is mine to avail
Such a tragic sight you are
Slave under my creed
Spurring me with those tears

I am beyond death
Midst a dreaming affinity
Saving strength now, faint whispers
Come erotic communion in its splendour

Fever mirrored ghosts
Night time consolation, cross the line
Draw murder into art
Sleep inside through days

In the wake of this relief
Shivering, longing for more
Insanity at its peak
Love me to my death
Lost are days of Spring
You sighed and let me in
Keep the beast inside
Shackled within my hide
Screaming out too late
Losing to my hate
Grew together with your skin
And paced the trails of sin

Your gaze covered with virgin snow
Rigid features
It's the shallow deeds who is to blame
Deafening shrieks pierced the night

A step from oblivion
Moving into the dim lights
Hiding within a reverie
It was worth it for the wait alone

Your body is mine to avail
Such a tragic sight you are
Slave under my creed
Spurring me with those tears3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Floating on mist
Crept up the caverns of my brain
Receiving no warning
From nothing to a life code
Walk with me, you'll never leave
Wait to see your spirit free
Tell me how your heart's in need
As I drown you in the sea
Unwinding snares of distrust
Your wrist in my fast grip
Look me in the eye, I'm clear
This is your time
Face down beneath the waterline
Gazing into the deep
From love to death in a time span of seconds
Oblivious to regret, pushed into belief
In liquid cellophane gasping for air
Mercy in my eyes is the shade of the night
Face down beneath the waterline
Gazing into the deep
The piercing sounds you make
Soaring higher, higher now
And once left in my wake
Your memory is nothing but the scars on me
All over now, forgotten why I needed this
Standing down, disappear into the obscure
Resting days waiting for new disease
Biding time, looked inside insanity
It always burns within
The downward spiral never ends
When driven into sin
Your salvation's found in a sinner's deed
All over now, forgotten why I needed this
Standing down, disappear into the obscure
Resting days waiting for new disease
Biding time, looked inside insanity
The devil guides the way, tells me what to say
Pours himself inside and snuffs the final light
Deliverance
Thrown back at me
Deliverance
Laughing at me
Deliverance
Thrown back at me
Deliverance
Laughing at me

By the turnstile beckons a damsel fair
The face of Melinda neath blackened hair
No joy would flicker in her eyes
Brooding sadness came to a rise

Words would falter to atone
Failure had passed the stepping stone
She had sworn her vows to another
This is when no-one will bother

And conceded pain in crumbling mirth
A harlot of God upon the earth
Found where she sacrificed her ways
That hollow love in her face

Still I plotted to have her back
The contentment that would fill the crack
My soul released a fluttering sigh
This day fell, the darkness nigh

I took her by the hand to say
All faith forever has been washed away
I returned for you in great dismay
Come with me, far away to stay
Endlessly gazing in nocturnal prime
She spoke of her vices and broke the rhyme
But baffled herself with the final line
My promise is made but my heart is thine7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Into the trees
Past meadow grounds
And further away from my home
Baying behind me
I hear the hounds
Flock's chasing to find me alone
A trail of sickness leading to me
If I am haunted then you will see
Searching the darkness and emptiness
I'm hiding away from the sun
Will never rest, never be at ease
All my matter's expired so I run
A trail of sickness leading to me
If I am haunted then you will see
There falls another
Vapor hands released the blade
Insane regrets at the drop
Instruments of death before me
Lose all to save a little at your peril it's justified
And dismiss your demons as death becomes a jest
You are the laughing stock of the absent minded
Confessions stuck in your mouth and long gone fevers reappear
Nocturnally helpless and weak in the light
Depending on a prayer
Pacing deserted roads to find a seed of hope
They are the trees
Rotten pulp inside and never well
Roots are sucking, thieving from my source
Tired boughs reaching for the light
It is all false pretension, harlequin forest
Awaiting redemption for a lifetime
As they die alone with no one by their side
Are they forgiven?
Stark determination poisoning the soul
Unfettered beast inside claiming sovereign control
And now the woods are burning, tearing life crops asunder
Useless blackened remains, still pyre smoldering5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"Det är för bedrövligt. Usch!
Vem fan är du?"

Take it as a threat now and leave
Drop of toxins flows to a habit
Tell me what it is you can't see
Teeth grinding flesh in the sabbat
Factual drowning stream, you believe
Slaves will follow conspiracy
Turn the locks on brother and kin
Murder lust on affinity

War in utopia
Slay cornucopia for symmetry

The parody is real
And we're biding time
And while losing ground, make sure to worship monarchy
Death is but a story in a land of borrowed wealth
The burdened scale weighs heavy with the hunt for dopamine

Intolerance disguised as a faith
In secrecy we shun empathy
Soul critique online far too late
A throne for the devout enemy
War in utopia
Slay cornucopia for symmetry

The parody is real
And we're biding time
And while losing ground, make sure to worship monarchy
Death is but a story in a land of borrowed wealth
The burdened scale weighs heavy with the hunt for dopamine

When I was young
So, so much younger than today
It seemed easier to lead your life
There was no time to surrender
And no reason to perceive
The burden of pain
As it passed through our lives every year somehow
And it never really went away
Yet behind my door
Was a kingdom
A secret outline showed the way
To treasures of clay
And beads made of glass4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The sigh of summer upon my return
Fifteen alike since I was here
Bathed in deep fog, blurring my trail
Snuffing the first morning rays
Weary from what might have been ages
Still calm with my mind at peace
Would I prosper or fall, drain the past
The lapse of the moment took it's turn

I was foul and tainted, devoid of faith
Wearing my death mask at birth
The hands of God decrepit and thin
Cold caress and then nothing
I was taken away from my plight
A treason bestowed to the crowd
Branded a Jonah with fevered blood
Ungodly freak, defiler

Pale touch, writhing in the embers
Damp mud burning in my eyes
All the faces turned away
And all would sneer at my demise
Outcast with dogmas forged below
Seared and beaten, banished from where I was born
No mercy would help me on my way
In the pouring rain, nothing is the same

Vows in ashes
I pledge myself to no one
Seethed and spiteful
All shudder at the call of my name

If you'll bear with me
You'll fear all of me

There is no forgiveness in these eyes
For any of you but one
Dispel the mist for now
Melinda is the reason why I've come

She is water drops over the pyre
A thistle in my hands
Stained and torn, aged and brown
Virtuous shell with kindred innocence
I awoke from the miasma
Passing swiftly through the moor
This is here, waters stir
And in the distance, all that was lost

If you'll bear with me
You'll fear all of me
You'd never leave me to
A fate with you6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In the corner, beside my window
There hangs a lonely photograph
There is no reason, I'd never notice
A memory that could hold me back

There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know you'll never return to this place

Gone through days without talking
There is a comfort in silence
So used to losing all ambition
Struggling to maintain what's left

There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know you'll never return to this place

Once undone, there is only smoke
Burning in my eyes to blind
To cover up what really happened
Force the darkness unto me
There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know you'll never return to this place9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Come into this night, here we'll be gone
So far away from our weak and crumbling lives
Come into this night, when days are done
Lost and astray in what's vanished from your eyes

What came and distorted your sight
Saw you benighted by your fright

Come into this night, your plight alone
Carry your weight, you are flawed as all of us
Come into this night - your only home
It's never too late to repent, suffer the loss

What came and distorted your sight
Saw you benighted by your fright

What came and distorted your sight
Saw you benighted by your fright
Come into this night, when you're able
To undo your deeds and atone with your lonely soul
Once you're into this night, all minds are stable
Forget all your needs, lose the grip of all control2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Long days, slow waste
Sew lies, sow hate

So many years to clean the slate
Endless despair within its wake
His touch soiling what used to be clean
His gaze burning on the edge of our dreams
No more

Long days, long days

And again he rides in
It's September and he covets the gullible
Skeletal wish hunter
A thousand lies, cast from the throne of secrecy
Hear him spewing forth a meaning to miserable lies
See the twisted hand of doubt seal the affair
The insect trust believer
Your body - a vehicle to house his disease

Pearls before swine, they are nothing but blind
Submit to nothing and swallow my spit of scorn
Invisible king, dying
Procession of woe, struck down by sorrow
A burden so great weighs heavy on old and withered beliefs
The swift solution crumbles
Beneath the mock notes of a masterpiece
Death in his eyes, waiting
Spiraling judgment, provoked in the rains
This futile test drowned in the levee of deception
This futile test drowned in the levee of deception

In the year of his sovereign
Rid us of your judgment

Lost, here is nowhere
Searching home still
Turning past me, all are gone
Time is now

The omen showed, took me away
Preparations are done, this can't last
The mere reflection brought disgust
No ordeal to conquer, this firm slit
It sheds upon the floor, dripping into a pool
Grant me sleep, take me under
Like the wings of a dove, folding around
I fade into this tender care5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
