Ah

Auschwitz, the meaning of pain
The way that I want you to die
Slow death, immense decay
Showers that cleanse you of your life
Forced in, like cattle you run
Stripped of
Your life's worth
Human mice, for the angel of death
Four hundred thousand more to die

Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead

Sadistic, surgeon of demise
Sadist of the noblest blood
Destroying, without mercy
To benefit the Aryan race
Surgery, with no anesthesia
Feel the knife pierce you intensely
Inferior, no use to mankind
Strapped down, screaming out to die
Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher
Angel of death

Pumped with fluid, inside your brain
Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
Burning flesh drips away
Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
Frigid cold cracks your limbs
How long can you last
In this frozen water burial?
Sewn together, joining heads
Just a matter of time
'Till you rip yourselves apart

Millions laid out in their
Crowded tombs
Sickening ways to achieve
The Holocaust

Seas of blood, bury life
Smell your death as it burns
Deep inside of you
Abacinate, eyes that bleed
Praying for the end of
Your wide awake nightmare
Wings of pain, reach out for you
His face of death staring down
Your blood's running cold
Injecting cells, dying eyes
Feeding on the screams of
The mutants he's creating
Pathetic harmless victims
Left to die
Rancid angel of death
Flying free


Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher

Trapped in purgatory
A lifeless object, alive
Awaiting reprisal
Death will be their acquittance
The sky is turning red
Return to power draws near
Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears
Abolish the rules made of stone

Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above

Awaiting the hour of reprisal
Your time slips away

Raining blood
From a lacerated sky
Bleeding its horror
Creating my structure
Now, I shall reign in blood

How I've waited for you to come
I've been here all alone
Now that you've arrived
Please stay awhile
And I promise I won't keep you long
I'll keep you forever (forever, forever, forever)

Graze the skin with my fingertips
The brush of dead, cold flesh appease the means
Provoking images, delicate features so smooth
A pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon

Dance with the dead in my dreams
Listen to their hallowed screams
The dead have taken my soul
Temptation's lost all control

Simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
Lose all mind control, rationale declines
Empty eyes enslave the creations
Of placid faces and lifeless pageants
In the depths of a mind insane
Fantasy and reality are the same


Graze the skin with my fingertips
The brush of dead, warm flesh pacifies the means
Incised members ornaments on my being
Adulating the skin before me

Simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
Lose all mind control, rationale declines
Empty eyes enslave the creations
Of placid faces and lifeless pageants

Dance with the dead in my dreams (Hello? Hello, Mr. Gein?)
Listen to their hallowed screams (Mr. Gein?)
The dead have taken my soul (Let me out of here, Mr. Gein)
Temptation's lost all control (Mr. Gein? I don't want to play anymore, Mr. Gein)
Dance with the dead in my dreams (Mr. Gein, this isn't fun anymore)
Listen to their hallowed screams (I don't wanna play anymore, Mr. Gein)
The dead have taken my soul (Mr. Gein? I want out of here, Mr. Gein)
Temptation's lost all control (Let me out now)7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
Unsuspecting victims, no warnings, no signs
Judgement day, the second coming arrives
Before you see the light, you must die

Forgotten children conform a new faith
Avidity and lust controlled by hate
The never ending search for your shattered sanity
Souls of damnation in their own reality

Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive habitat

Bastard sons begat your cunting daughters
Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers
Ingrate souls condemned for all eternity
Obtained by immoral observance a domineering deity

Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive sabbath
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven


The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul
A force that has lived all eternity
The never ending search for a truth never told
The loss of all hope and your dignity

Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive habitat

On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven

Razor's edge
Outlines the dead
Incisions in my head
Anticipation the stimulation
To kill the exhilaration

Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
Close your eyes
And forget your name
Step outside yourself
And let your thoughts drain
As you go insane, go insane

Innate seed
To watch you bleed
A demanding physical need
Desecrated, eviscerated
Time's perpetuated
Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
Close your eyes
And forget your name
Step outside yourself
And let your thoughts drain
As you go insane, go insane


Inert flesh
A bloody tomb
A decorated splatter brightens the room
An execution, a sadist ritual
Mad intervals of mind residuals

Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul

And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
Close your eyes
And forget your name

Aaaaaaahhhhh


Blasting our way through the boundaries of Hell
No one can stop us tonight
We take on the world with hatred inside
Mayhem, the reason we fight
Surviving the slaughters and killing we've lost
Then we return from the dead
Attacking once more now with twice as much strength
We conquer, then move on ahead

Evil
My words defy
Evil
Has no disguise
Evil
Will take your soul
Evil
My wrath unfolds

Satan, our master in evil mayhem
Guides us with every first step
Our axes are growing with power and fury
Soon there'll be nothing else left
Midnight has come and the leathers strapped on
Evil is at our command
We clash with God's angels and conquer new souls
Consuming all that we can

Evil
Aah, haha
Evil
Has no disguise
Evil
Will take your soul

Drones since the dawn of time
Compelled to live your sheltered lives
Not once has anyone ever seen
Such a rise of pure hypocrisy
I'll instigate, I'll free your mind
I'll show you what I've known all this time

God hates us all, God hates us all
You know it's true, God hates this place
You know it's true, He hates this race

Homicide, suicide
Hate heals, you should try it sometime
Strive for peace with acts of war
The beauty of death we all adore
I have no faith distracting me
I know why your prayers will never be answered

God hates us all, God hates us all
God hates us all, God hates us all
Yeah, he fuckin' hates me

Pessimist, terrorist targeting the next mark
Global chaos feeding on hysteria
Cutthroat, slit your wrist, shoot you in the back, fair game
Drug abuse, self-abuse, searching for the next high
Sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time
I'm waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies

I never said I wanted to be God's disciple
I'll never be the one to blindly follow

Man-made virus infecting the world
Self-destruct, human time bomb
What if there is no God? Would you think the fucking same?
Wasting your life in a leap of blind faith
Wake the fuck up, can't ignore what I say
I got my own philosophy
I hate everyone equally
You can't tear that out of me
No segregation, separation
Just me in my world of enemies
I never said I wanted to be God's disciple
I'll never be the one to blindly follow
I'll never be the one to bear the cross
Disciple

I reject this fuckin' race

Arrogance, violence, world in disarray
Dealing with insanity every fuckin' day
I hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fuckin' scene
Pissing match of egos, fuck their vanity
Ain't got the time, I don't want anything from you
Feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin' do
No looking back, no regrets, no apologies
What you get is what you see

Live fast, on high
Repentless, let it ride

My songs relive the atrocities of war
Can't take society any fuckin' more
Intensity, anarchy, hatred amplified
Playing this shit is all that keeps me alive
I leave it all on the road, living on the stage
This is my life where I kill it every day
So take your shot, bottom's up, this is no lie
I'll be beating this guitar till the day I die

Live fast, on high
Repentless, let it ride

I hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fuckin' scene
Pissing match of egos, fuck their vanity
Ain't got the time, I don't want anything from you

Funeral held for the depression of man
Holds the key to his own death
Entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
Tighten the tourniquet around your neck
Sifting away the debris of hated life
Cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
Seeking life beyond your perishment
Repeating words echoing through your mind

Chanting lines of blind witchery
To save yourself from extinction
Wanting to die is your reason to live
New life born from the oppressed
Taste your blood as it trickles through the air
Another casualty, beyond the shadows you fall
Losing ground, the fate you feel draws near
Fatality, reality, await the final call


My sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
Skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity
Vessels in my brain carrying death until my birth
Come and die with me forever, share insanity
Do you wanna die?!
The waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies
Turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind
Non-rising body from the grave showing new reality
What I am, what I want, I’m only after death1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Join us 
Welcome back


Existing on damnation's edge
The priest had never known
To witness such a violent show
Of power overthrown
Angels fighting aimlessly
Still dying by the sword
Our legions killing all in sight
To get the one called Lord

The gates of Hell lie waiting, as you see
There's no price to pay, just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved

Crucify your so-called "Lord"
He soon shall fall to me
Your souls are damned, your God has fell
To slave for me eternally
Hell awaits
The reaper guards the darkened gates
That Satan calls his home
Demons feed the furnace where
The dead are free to roam
Lonely children of the night
There's seven ways to go
Each leading to the burning hole
That Lucifer controls

Priests of Hades seek the sacred star
Satan sees the answer lies not far
Zombies, screaming souls, cry out to you
Satanic law prevails, your life is through

Pray to the moon, when it is round
Death with you shall then abound
For what you seek for can't be found
In sea or sky or underground


Now I have you deep inside
My everlasting grasp
The seven bloody gates of Hell
Is where you'll live your last
Warriors from Hell's domain
Will bring you to your death
The flames of Hades burning strong
Your soul shall never rest
The gates of Hell lie waiting, as you see
There's no price to pay, just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved

Sacrifice the lives of all
I know they soon shall die
Their souls are damned to rot in Hell
And keep the fires growing deep inside
Hell awaits

Propaganda death ensemble
Burial to be
Corpses rotting through the night
In blood-laced misery
Scorched earth, the policy
The reason for the siege
The pendulum, it shaves the blade
The strafing air blood raid

Infiltration push reserves
Encircle the front lines
Supreme art of strategy
Playing on the minds
Bombard till submission
Take all to their graves
Indication of triumph:
The numbers that are dead

Sport the war
War support

The sport is war, total war
When victory's really massacre
The final swing is not a drill
It's how many people I can kill

Your fallen walls
Spearhead break through the lines
Flanked all around
Soldiers of attrition
Forward their ground

Old in its time

Deep in the Rhine

You go to the church, you kiss the cross
You will be saved at any cost
You have your own reality, Christianity
You spend your life just kissing ass
A trait that's grown as time has passed
You think the world will end today
You praise the Lord, that's all you say

Jesus saves
Listen to you pray
You think you'll see the pearly gates when Death takes you away

For all respect, you cannot lust
In an invisible man you place your trust
Indirect dependency
Eternal attempt at amnesty
He will decide who lives and dies
Depopulate, Satanic rise
You will be an accessory
Irreverence and blasphemy

Jesus saves
No need to pray, the gates of pearl have turned to gold
It seems you've lost your way


Jesus saves
No words of praise, no promised land to take you to
There is no other way3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Eternal, the kiss I breathe
Siphon your blood to me
Feel my wounds of your God
Forever rape mortality
I smell of death, I reek of hate, I will live forever
Lost child, pay the dead
Bleeding screams of silence
In my veins, your eternity

I'll kill you and your dreams tonight
Begin new life
Bleed your death upon me
Let your bloodline feed my youth

First breath born, come alive, learn to kill
Bloodfest awaits to feed your hunger
Dark side has no rival test, your faith in blood
Night hides the hunting packs, a feeding frenzy

I'll kill you and your dreams tonight
Begin new life
Bleed your death upon me
Let your bloodline feed my youth
I am the first, not the last
Condemned by a single kiss
Betrayed eternally
I'll rip inside your soul
Contaminating the world
Defying God and son
Black heart that brings your death
Living in infamy

Pain and hunger drives your madness

Disease spreading death, entire population dies
Dead before you're born, massive suicide
Vicious game of fear, it's all extermination now

Erasing your existence

Here on the table of hell
A figure in white, unknown by man
Approaching the altar of death
High priest awaiting, dagger in hand
Spilling the pure virgin blood
Satan's slaughter, ceremonial death
Answer his every command

Death will come easy, just close your eyes
Dream of the friends, you'll see
Heavenly failure, losing again
Move on to a new form of life

Altar of sacrifice, curse of the damned
Confronting the evil you dread
Coalesce into one your shadow and soul
Soon you will meet the undead

Blood turning black, the change has begun
Feeling the hatred of all damned in Hell
Flesh starts to burn, twist and deform
Eyes dripping blood, realization of death
Transforming of five toes to two
Learn the sacred words of praise, Hail Satan


A gift of powers disposed upon you
Use them when you feel the need
Master the forces and powers of Satan
Controlling the creature's instinct
Drawn to the castles that float in the sky
Learn to resist the temptation
Watching the angels sift through the heavens
Endlessly searching for salvation

I have witnessed your death
I've seen it many times
Your tortured screams
Your decrepit little mind
A father's son
With pathetic eyes that bleed
Twins in the end
Begin and let the brothers fall

I will see you burned alive
Screaming for your God
I will watch you die again for Him

God won't touch what I've done
He cries upon my feet
A privileged pain
Beneath buried are your dead
On splintered bones I walk
Sifting through the blood
Besieged in fear
Await the coming of the God

I will watch you die again for Him
Blood is raining downward
The stain reflects the sun
Conquer divide within
Terrorize the mind
I've seen the end, it's yours
Rosary in hand
Your selfish flesh, it melts
Spilling from the sky

I will see you burned alive
Screaming for your God
I will watch you die

This is God's war
God's war
This is God's war
God's war

War of holy principles
I'm seeking God's help in your destruction
Slit the throat of heathen man
And let his blood dilute the water
Bury your dead
Fuck your God, erase his name
A lady weeps, insane with sorrow
I'll take his towers from the world
You're fuckin' raped upon your deathbed

This is God's war
God's war
This is God's war
God's war
Fucking holy war


Be optimistic, happy, and calm
Show no fear or anxiety
Smile at the face of God
And your reward will be eternity
Holy warriors
Your patience will be justified
Everything is for Him
You must not comfort the animal before you kill it
Strike as champions at the heart of the nonbelievers
Strike above the neck and at all extremities
For it's a point of no return for Almighty God
God will give victory to his faithful servants
When you reach ground zero, you will have killed the enemy

Spells surround me day and night
Stricken by the force of evil light
The force of evil light

Fight to resist the evil inside
Captive of a force of Satan's might
A force of Satan's might

Crying in lust

Victim of fortune, my sources grow small
Life slips away as demons come forth
