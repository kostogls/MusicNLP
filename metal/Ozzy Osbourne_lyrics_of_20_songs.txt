All aboard! Ha ha ha ha ha haaaa!
Ay (ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay)

Crazy, but that's how it goes
Millions of people living as foes
Maybe it's not too late
To learn how to love and forget how to hate

Mental wounds not healing
Life's a bitter shame

I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
(Let's go!)

I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools
I've watched all the dropouts who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it and you live the role

Mental wounds still screaming
Driving me insane
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words, yeah, yeah!

Heirs of a cold war, that's what we've become
Inheriting troubles, I'm mentally numb
Crazy, I just cannot bear
I'm living with something that just isn't fair

Mental wounds not healing
Who and what's to blame?

I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

Mr. Crowley, what went on in your head?
Oh, Mr. Crowley, did you talk to the dead?
Your life style to me, seemed so tragic
With the thrill of it all
You fooled all the people with magic
Yeah, you waited on Satan's call

Mr. Charming, did you think you were pure?
Mr. Alarming, in nocturnal rapport
Uncovering things that were sacred
Manifest on this Earth
Conceived in the eye of a secret
And they scattered the afterbirth


Mr. Crowley, won't you ride my white horse?
Mr. Crowley, it's symbolic, of course
Approaching a time that is classic
I hear that maiden's call
Approaching a time that is drastic
Standing with their backs to the wall

Was it polemically sent?
I wanna know what you meant
I wanna know, I wanna know what you meant, yeah

Gazing through the window at the world outside
Wondering will mother earth survive
Hoping that mankind will stop abusing her sometime
After all there's only just the two of us
And here we are still fighting for our lives
Watching all of history repeat itself time after time

I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away
I'm just a dreamer who dreams of better days

I watch the sun go down like everyone of us
I'm hoping that the dawn will bring a sign
A better place for those who will come after us this time

I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away, oh yeah
I'm just a dreamer who dreams of better days

Your higher power may be God or Jesus Christ
It doesn't really matter much to me
Without each other's help there ain't no hope for us
I'm living in a dream of fantasy, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

If only we could all just find serenity
It would be nice if we could live as one
When will all this anger, hate and bigotry be gone?

I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away, today
I'm just a dreamer who dreams of better days, okay

The light in the window is a crack in the sky
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
The man in the dark will bring another attack
Your mama told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
Look in the mirror, tell me, do you think your life's in danger? Yeah

No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)

Another day passes as the night closes in
The red light goes on to say it's time to begin
I see the man around the corner waiting, can he see me?
I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here

No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
No more tears (Tears, tears)
Going forward in reverse
Still, these were our first
It's just a hand in the bush
A hand in the bush


So now that it's over can't we just say goodbye?
I'd like to move on and make the most of the night
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way
Your lips are so cold, I don't know what else to say
I never wanted it to end this way, my love, my darling
Believe me when I say to you in love I think I'm falling here

No more tears (Tears, tears)

Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liquor
Take a bottle and drown your sorrows
Then it floods away tomorrows, away tomorrows
Evil thoughts and evil doings
Cold, alone you hang in ruins
Thought that you'd escape The Reaper
You can't escape the Master Keeper

'Cause you feel life's unreal and you're living a lie
Such a shame who's to blame and you're wondering why
Then you ask from your cask is there life after birth
What you saw can be Hell on this earth, Hell on this earth

Now you live inside a bottle
The Reaper's traveling at full throttle
It's catching you but you don't see
The Reaper's you and The Reaper is me

Breaking laws, knocking doors, but there's no one at home
Made your bed, rest your head, but you lie there and moan
Where to hide, Suicide is the only way out
Don't you know what it's really about
Ah, now people, you really know where it's at
Ah, ah you got it, fox
Get the flaps out, Satan, Satan, Satan, ha ha ha

Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker

Out on the streets I'm stalking the night
I can hear my heavy breathing
Paid for the kill, but it doesn't seem right
Something there I can't believe in
Voices are calling from inside my head
I can hear them, I can hear them
Vanishing memories of things that were said
They can't try to hurt me now

But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you
All right

Taught by the powers that preach over me
I can hear their empty reasons
I wouldn't listen, I learned how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason
But just like the wounded, and when it's too late
They'll remember, they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now
But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Nothing that you can do
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you
All right

But just like the wounded, and when it's too late
They'll remember, they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

Nothing that you can do
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you

Screams break the silence
Waking from the dead of night
Vengeance is boiling
He's returned to kill the light

Then when he's found who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon
Ha ha ha ha ha

Years spent in torment
Buried in a nameless grave
Now he has risen
Miracles would have to save

Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon
Hey yeah, bark at the moon
They cursed and buried him along with shame
And thought his timeless soul had gone, gone
In empty burning hell - unholy one
But he's returned to prove them wrong (so wrong)
Ooh, yeah baby


Howling in shadows
Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell

Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon
Hey yeah, bark at the moon
Hey yeah, bark at the moon

Watch me die another day
Hopeless situation
Endless price I have to pay

Sanity, now it's beyond me
There's no choice

Diary of a madman
Walk the line again today
Entries of confusion
Dear diary, I'm here to stay

Manic depression befriends me
Hear his voice
Sanity, now it's beyond me
There's no choice


A sickened mind and spirit
The mirror tells me lies
Could I mistake myself for someone
Who lives behind my eyes?
Will he escape my soul
Or will he live in me?
Is he trying to get out
Or trying to enter me?

Voices in the darkness
Scream away my mental health
Can I ask a question
To help me save me from myself?

Enemies fill up the pages
Are they me?

Something in my vision, something deep inside
Where did I wander, where do you think I wandered to
I've seen life's magic astral plane I travel through

Fever of a breakout burning in me miles wide
