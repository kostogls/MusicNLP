As cold as stone, they march in darkness
Enslaving the young and killing their fathers
But soon they'll know the path they've chosen
Has carved their faith in stone

In blood and tears, a thousand times
We rise against, we'll always hold the line of reckoning

Red tears run down like a river
Don't close your eyes, it won't disappear
No fear you wanna end the pain
Don't let go, don't back down, hold the line, we'll bring the reckoning
(Bring the reckoning)

In blood and tears, a thousand times
We rise against, we'll always hold the line of reckoning

We're all alone, walking in twilight
The night has been long, and so many have fallen
Feel no remorse, light will be breaking
Our freedom is worth it all
In blood and tears, a thousand times
We'll rise against, we'll always hold the line of reckoning

Red tears run down like a river
Don't close your eyes, it won't disappear
No fear you wanna end the pain
Don't let go, don't back down, hold the line, we'll bring the reckoning

I see your face, find peace of mind
Between the madness and the sadness and the fire burning
The end of war, the great divine
We'll see the day of reckoning

In blood and tears, a thousand times
We rise against, we'll always hold the line
In blood and tears, a thousand times
We'll rise against, we'll always hold the line of reckoning
We'll bring the reckoning
In blood and tears, a thousand times
We rise against, we'll always hold the line of reckoning3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Blood for freedom

You're pushing me into the corner, don't fight with me
Don't fight with me, don't fight with me
I'm crowning no man for his armour or Rhapsody
For what I see and what I feel

Wake up
I'm defying you, seeing right through you, once I believed in you
Wake up
Feel what's coming deep within we all know

Blood for freedom
So raise your banner, fight your war
Break the silence, no remorse
Won't die within
Blood for freedom
Raise your banner, won't you come
Fight the venom, the good die young
Won't die within

I'm feeling the eyes of the fallen, they're watching me
They make me see, they make me see
I'm feeling the pain, how you break them and make them bleed
You make them bleed, you make them bleed
Wake up
I'm defying you, seeing right through you, once I believed in you
Wake up
Feel what's coming deep within we all know
The way that you torment me
The way that you challenge me
The way that you make me bleed

Blood for freedom
So raise your banner, fight your war
Break the silence, no remorse
Won't die within
Blood for freedom
Raise your banner, won't you come
Fight the venom, the good die young
Won't die within


Blood for freedom
So raise your banner, fight your war
Break the silence, no remorse
Won't die within
Blood for freedom
Raise your banner, won't you come
Fight the venom, the good die young
Won't die within
When gods are failing
They put all heaven in a rage
We're on our own
Our tears keep falling
They're setting fire to the flame
Blood for freedom2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm waiting for you, supernova
I’m waiting for you, supernova, supernova, supernova
I'm waiting for you, supernova, supernova, supernova

Drowning in a haze, and I just wanna get in deeper
Purple skies with a million stars, I'm falling ground
These days when I’m losing track of time
These days when I'm burning up inside
These days when I'm lost, I search the skies

I'm waiting for your last goodbye
'Cause I'm not over it, not over it
I'm waiting for your last goodbye
The kiss of time
Like thunder screaming out for a flash of lightning
Stars are falling down for God's applause
I’m waiting for the light of your supernova
Your last goodbye

I’m waiting for you, supernova, supernova, supernova
I'm waiting for you
When the lights go down, I’m still here, and I'm singing for you
When the lights go down, I can't let the music fade
I dive in deep and soar so high
I blow the ashes through the sky
On a hill, I'm here to say goodbye

I’m waiting for your last goodbye
'Cause I'm not over it, not over it
I'm waiting for your last goodbye
The kiss of time
Like thunder screaming out for a flash of lightning
Stars are falling down for God's applause
I'm waiting for the light of your supernova
Your last goodbye

I'm waiting for you

As long as I dream, it ain't over, over
I'll break the chains of gravity
Oh, I long for your fire, yeah, I long for your fire
My heart is lost between the stars
Drowning in a haze, and I just wanna get in deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper

I'm waiting for your last goodbye
'Cause I'm not over it, not over it
I'm waiting for your last goodbye
The kiss of time
Like thunder screaming out for a flash of lightning
Stars are falling down for God's applause
I'm waiting for the light of your supernova
Your last goodbye

I'm waiting for you, supernova
I'm waiting for you, supernova, supernova, supernova
I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting for you, supernova, supernova, supernova

You're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
And when you reach out for the stars
They just cut you down

Looking through the glass, cannot recognise the ghost that you are seeing
Every step you take on the burning sand slowly sinking deeper
All the memories remain, all the pain from your broken home (Oh)
And the walls ’round your heart grew so strong, you can't let go

You keep crawling on
Don't wanna let it go
So you keep holding on
To feel whole

’Cause you're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
And when you reach out for the stars
They just cut you down
'Cause you're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
Is it worth dying for?
Or are you blinded by, blinded by it all?
Here they come again, hear them whispering when your heart is bleeding
Like a symphony playing on repeat, unraveling your feelings
All the memories remain, all the strain, you feel broken up
And the weight that you feel pulls you down, you can't let go

You keep crawling on
Don't wanna let it go
So you keep holding on
To feel whole

'Cause you're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
And when you reach out for the stars
They just cut you down
’Cause you’re fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
Is it worth dying for?
Or are you blinded by, blinded by it all?

It's an endless war
But then they cut you down, they cut you down once more
(System overload
Self-destruct sequence activated
One minute until self-destruction)
Don’t let them cut you down, cut you down once moreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It burns into your heart the darkness that you fear
You were never free, and you never realized
And love is a word you've never heard
Your heart ain't cold 'cause it burns a desire to leave the mire

Take your breath till nothing's left
Scars of life upon your chest
And I know wherever it goes

And we run with a lonely heart
And we run for this killing love
And we run till the heavens above
Yeah, we run, running in the dark
And we run till we fall apart
And we run till the heavens above

Don't blink, you'll miss it, lift up your head
We gotta get gone, yeah, we outta here
Don't blink, you'll miss it, lift up your head
Too late, we're gone, yeah, we outta here
And we run with a lonely heart
And we run for this killing love
And we run for a heavenly heart
I'mma break these chains, ran through the rain
Never look back, never quit, work through the pain
This blood in my veins run cold when I think
It'll never be the same, but I never lose hope
This is my time now, no time for tears, celebrate
Put it in the air right now, never back down
You could never wear my crown 'cause it weigh too much
And I crush every motherfucking thing I touch
This is love, I've never loved so much
Get involved, make the world stand up
Give my life before I ever give up
"Name in lights", you lost all my trust
Now it's time to face all of us
Get in line 'cause they're calling us
And it feels so marvelous
Just take my hand and run

And we run with a lonely heart
And we run for this killing love
And we run till the heavens above
Yeah, we run, running in the dark
And we run till we fall apart
And we run till the heavens above
Don't blink, you'll miss it, lift up your head
We gotta get gone, yeah, we outta here
Don't blink, you'll miss it, lift up your head
Too late, we're gone, yeah, we outta here
And we run with a lonely heart
And we run for this killing love
And we run for a heavenly heart

I'm dying to catch my breath
Oh why don't I ever learn?
I've lost all my trust
Though I've surely tried to turn it around

Can you still see the heart of me?
All my agony fades away
When you hold me in your embrace

Don't tear me down for all I need
Make my heart a better place
Give me something I can believe
Don't tear me down
You've opened the door now, don't let it close

I'm here on the edge again
I wish I could let it go
I know that I'm only one step away
From turning it around

Can you still see the heart of me?
All my agony fades away
When you hold me in your embrace
Don't tear me down for all I need
Make my heart a better place
Give me something I can believe
Don't tear it down, what's left of me
Make my heart a better place

I tried many times but nothing was real
Make it fade away, don't break me down
I want to believe that this is for real
Save me from my fear
Don't tear me down

Don't tear me down for all I need
Make my heart a better place
Don't tear me down for all I need
Make my heart a better place
Give me something I can believe
Don't tear it down, what's left of me

We are forever as one in what remains
You're in my blood from the cradle to the grave
I don't like to think about the pieces
Or the cracks and the breaks that still remain
If I could breathe, I'd ask you

To look in my mercy mirror
I need you more than I have known
To look in my mercy mirror
'Cause I'm not ready to let you go
Now I know, now I know
I'm not ready to let you go
Now I know, now I know
I'm not ready to let you go
I'm not ready to let you go

My heart like a planet the sun forgot
Where now? Orbiting the light that I had lost
More than words, the silence teaches
How to see and to feel what is real
When sunlight reaches my soul

So look in my mercy mirror
I need you more than I have known
So look in my mercy mirror
'Cause I'm not ready to let you go
Now I know, now I know
I'm not ready to let you go
Now I know, now I know
I'm not ready to let you go
It's a wicked game life plays
How it gives and takes away
No turning 'round, touching ground
What we had was so much more than I realised
If I could, I'd embrace, embrace you

And look in my mercy mirror
I need you more than I have known
So look in my mercy mirror
'Cause I'm not ready to let you go
Now I know, now I know
I'm not ready to let you go
Now I know, now I know

Sparkling angel I believed
You were my savior in my time of need
Blinded by faith I couldn't hear
All the whispers, the warnings so clear
I see the angels
I'll lead them to your door
There's no escape now
No mercy no more
No remorse cause I still remember
The smile when you tore me apart
You took my heart
Deceived me right from the start
You showed me dreams
I wish they would turn into real
You broke the promise and made me realize
It was all just a lie
Sparkling angel, I couldn't see
Your dark intentions, your feelings for me
Fallen angel, tell me why?
What is the reason, the thorn in your eye?
I see the angels
I'll lead them to your door
There's no escape now
No mercy no more
No remorse cause I still remember
The smile when you tore me apart
You took my heart
Deceived me right from the start
You showed me dreams
I wished they would turn into real
You broke the promise and made me realize
It was all just a lie
Could have been forever
Now we have reached the end
This world may have failed you
It doesn't give you reason why
You could have chosen a different path in life
The smile when you tore me apart
You took my heart
Deceived me right from the start
You showed me dreams
I wish they would turn into real
You broke the promise and made me realize
It was all just a lie
Could have been forever

I've been left out alone like a damn criminal
I've been praying for help cause I can't take it all
I'm not done, it's not over
Now I'm fighting this war since the day of the fall
And I'm desperately holding on to it all
But I'm lost, I'm so damn lost

Oh I wish it was over
And I wish you were here
Still I'm hoping that somehow

Cause your soul is on fire, a shot in the dark
What did they aim for when they missed your heart
I breathe underwater, it's all in my hands
What can I do, don't let it fall apart

A shot in the dark
A shot in the dark

In the blink of an eye, I can see through your eyes
As I'm lying awake I'm still hearing the cries
And it hurts, hurts me so bad
And I'm wondering why I still fight in this life
Cause I've lost all my faith in this damn bitter strife
And it's sad, it's so damn sad

Oh I wish it was over
And I wish you were here
Still I'm hoping that somehow

Cause your soul is on fire, a shot in the dark
What did they aim for when they missed your heart
I breathe underwater, it's all in my hands
What can I do, don't let it fall apart

A shot in the dark

Beautify all I know, keep on dancing
Let it all turn to gold
When the dream touches ground, the demons walk in
And I know what awaits

A priceless glory
Memento mori
All for nothing now
I know

Nothing of the heart remains
Even if we could've stayed
We've been here long enough
Long enough to know it's all in vain
Everything we tried to say
Up until the final day
I guess we said enough
Said enough to know it's all in vain

All in vain
All in vain
All in vain
All in vain
See the world through a tear, keep on breathing
Salt has dried, you're not here
Just a heartbeat away, the demons walk in
Now I know it's too late

A priceless glory
Memento mori
All for nothing now
I know

Nothing of the heart remains
Even if we could've stayed
We've been here long enough
Long enough to know it's all in vain
Everything we tried to say

Said enough to know it's all in vain

All in vain
All in vain
All in vain
All in vain
Took the memories, but I can feel them fading
All our vanities, there's nothing left to save me now
I can take 'em 'cross the border
I can take 'em 'cross the border
Leaving everything we have for you to find it
Every time I walk away, I wanna turn around
I wanna turn around

But nothing of the heart remains
Even if we could've stayed
We've been here long enough
Long enough to know it's all in vain

Up until the final day

Got no scars cut on my skin, only my truth is wearing thin
And it hollows me, it hollows me
I hate the darkness of my past, the cold rebelling, it drives me mad
And it follows me, it's carving the heart out of me
I've got to bleed it out, all my thought intoxicated
'Cause the weight on me, it buries me alive

It pulls me down right into the darkness
It pulls me down, and I can't resist

Not leaving me alone behind
There's no other way
I prayed to the gods let him stay
The memories ease the pain inside
Now I know why

All of my memories keep you near
In silent moments imagine you'd be here
All of my memories keep you near
Your silent whispers, silent tears

Made me promise I'd try
To find my way back in this life
I hope there is a way
To give me a sign you're okay
Reminds me again it's worth it all
So I can go on

All of my memories keep you near

Carry on your fire and raise your head
And everything comes to an end when hearts asunder

When you gather like birds of prey
Rejoice what is broken and turning away
There's no rest 'cause these wounds won't heal
I can't let it go, can't let it go
No matter how deep we're falling for our calling
Can't look back 'cause it leads me to nowhere
What is awaiting, I'll embrace it
In the end, all I know, I have to face it

Carry on your fire and raise your hеad
And save yourself from their collеctive projection
Carry on your fire and raise your head

Birds and butterflies
Rivers and mountains she creates
But you'll never know
The next move she'll make
You can try
But it is useless to ask why
Cannot control her
She goes her own way

She rules
Until the end of time
She gives and she takes
She rules
Until the end of time
She goes her way

With every breath
And all the choices that we make
We are only passing through
On her way
I find my strength
Believing that their soul lives on
Until the end of time
I'll carry them with me
She rules
Until the end of time
She gives and she takes
She rules
Until the end of time
She goes her way

Once you will know, my dear
You don't have to fear (you don't have to fear)
A new beginning (beginning)
Always starts at the end
Once you will know, my dear
You don't have to fear
Until the end of time
(Until the end of time)
Until the end of time
(Until the end of time)
Until the end of time
She goes her way

She rules
Until the end of time
She gives and she takes
She rules
Until the end of time
Until the end of time
Until the end of time
She goes her way2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I paid my dues all for truth
Can't leave it here, leave it here, leave it here forgotten
Silence rules, as blind as fools
We'll never learn, never learn, never learn to break away

Oh, why can't we rise again?

When all the days go by a firelight
We'll never fade out in the night
And we are estranged, we're drawn to the flame
We are like fire to the rain

Isn't it strange that love is in the way?
It never goes away, never goes away

I paid my dues all for truce
I'll leave it here, leave it here, leave it here forgotten
Love will rule over truth
We'll never learn, never learn, never learn to break away

Oh, why can't we rise again?
When all the days go by a firelight
We'll never fade out in the night
And we are estranged, we're drawn to the flame
We are like fire to the rain
Isn't it strange that love is in the way?
Isn't it strange that love is in the way?
When all the days go by a firelight
We'll never fade out in the night
And we are estranged, we're drawn to the flame
We are like fire to the rain

Isn't strange that love is in the way?
It never goes away, away1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Would you mind if I hurt you?
Understand that I need to
Wish that I had other choices
Than to harm the one I love
What have you done now?

I know I'd better stop tryin'
You know that there's no denyin'
I won't show mercy on you now
I know I should stop believing
I know there's no retrieving
It's over now, what have you done?
What have you done now?

I have been waitin' for someone like you
But now you are slippin' away (What have you done now?)
Why, why does fate make us suffer?
There's a curse between us, between me and you

What have you done, what have you done?
What have you done, what have you done?
What have you done now?
What have you done, what have you done?
What have you done, what have you done?
What have you done now?
Would you mind if I killed you?
Would you mind if I tried to?
'Cause you have turned into my worst enemy
You carry hate that I don't feel
It's over now, what have you done?
What have you done now?

I have been waitin' for someone like you
But now you are slippin' away, oh (What have you done now?)
Why, why does fate make us suffer?
There's a curse between us, between me and you...

What have you done, what have you done?
What have you done, what have you done?
What have you done now?
What have you done, what have you done?
What have you done, what have you done?
What have you done now?

What have you done?
(What have you done, what have you done?)
(What have you done, what have you done?)
I will not fall, won't let it go
We will be free when it ends...
I have been waitin' for someone like you
But now you are slippin' away (What have you done now?)
Why, why does fate make us suffer?
There's a curse between us, between me and you
I've been waitin' for someone like you
But now you are slippin' away (What have you done now?)
Why, why does fate make us suffer?
There's a curse between us, between me and you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
