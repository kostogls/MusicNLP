Don't hear, don't deem
Drown in before you dive
Don't care, commit
To your self destruction drive
I kiss the ground
With love beyond forever
Flip off the sky
With bleeding fingers till I die
Enemy, take a one good look at me
Eradicate what you will always be
Your tainted flesh, polluted soul
Through a mirror I behold
Throw a punch, shards bleed on the floor
Tearing me apart but I don't care anymore
Should I regret or ask myself
Are you dead yet?
Wake up, don't cry
Regenerate to deny
The truth, the fiction
You live in blindfold on your eyes
Disclosure, self loathing
This time you've gone too far
Or could it be
My nemesis that you 're me?
Enemy, take a one good look at me
Eradicate what you will always be
Your tainted flesh, polluted soul
Through a mirror I behold
Throw a punch, shards bleed on the floor
Tearing me apart but I don't care anymore
Should I regret or ask myself
Are you dead yet?
Enemy, take a one good look at me
Eradicate what you will always be
Your tainted flesh, polluted soul
Through a mirror I behold
Throw a punch, shards bleed on the floor

Are you dead yet?

Since day one I've been crass and far beyond
I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry
Before you gauge me, take a look at yourself
Condescending, outlivin' in a lie

Despite all the pain in my heart grinding through
It ain't due that you hate that I hate what you do

Despite all the piety you've been consuming thus far
A backstabbing motherfucker to the bone is what you are

And everyday when the knife in my back starts to twinge n' turn
My eyes are catching fire and my heart starts to burn
A foot away from you is like a bit closer to heaven
Then again it's like being needled 24/7

You look down to me to see the scum of the earth to be
Fuck you, that's me, vile and obscene
I ain't happy about it but at least I don't judge and decree
To be better than another human being
And everyday when the knife in my back starts to twinge n' turn
My eyes are catching fire and my heart starts to burn
A foot away from you is like a bit closer to heaven
Then again it's like being needled 24/7

Despite all the piety you've been consuming thus far
Hey, would somebody tell me what the fuck is going on?

And everyday when the knife in my back starts to twinge n' turn
My eyes are catching fire and my heart starts to burn
A foot away from you is like a bit closer to heaven
Then again it's like being needled 24/7

What do you know about death...?"2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

GO!
Conflict, terror, hear the noise
You're on the edge of a nerve-racking force
But, oh, my god, here's the fight
Never siege, never riot, must defy
Well look at me, what do you see?
Another trophy, a living fucking dead beat
Close your eyes take a step with me
You're gone but it's not too late
Exhibiting Abnormality
Careful what you call reality
But you will always forget
One thing I'd like you to know
I don't give a flying fuck motherfucker
I don't give a flying fuck motherfucker
I don't give a flying
I don't give a flying
I don't give a flying FUCK
I'll never wait for any interference
When the other people talk all over my shit
But do I speak thee, yes I do
So fuck hypocrisy and fuck you too
INCOMING!

Say one, more word, I double dare you (bring it on)
It's my world, you're in it, it'll take you down in a minute
You can alter your look, diversify your age
But the truth seems like a bitchslap in your face

The faint blaze of the candle
Of my life slowly dying
Like a fire in a pouring rain
No sparks of hope inside
No shooting stars on my sky
On broken wings, no flying high...

Another night, another demise...
Cadaverous wind blowing cold as ice...
I'll let the wind blow out the light
'cause it gets more painful every time I die

Out of strength to fight
I cannot take another night
I cannot take it no more
Lust of light slips through my fingers
Like blood on my arms
Black candle wax has buried me...

Another night, another demise...
Cadaverous wind blowing cold as ice...
I'll let the wind blow out the light
'cause it gets more painful every time I die1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"Death be not proud
Though some have called thee mighty and dreadful
For thou art not so"

Losing the war I'm feining to win
Though I never tried to to strive deep from within
Life could be beautiful for anybody it's for
But I'd swear this mothafuckin' shit is rotten to the core

The portal has been past and it's time to make a turn
To follow the reaper until the point of no return

When your blindly death-raying blade
Weeps the griefs and fears away
I cross my heart and hope to die
Thy freedom will be mine

Sinking down in the ocean of severe emotions
Grab a bottle to drink up the pain-relieving potion
But after all, that got boring too
So no matter what happens, I couldn't give a damn or too
The portal has been past 'til the point of no return
No more lines to cross no more bridges to burn

Now when your blindly death-raying blade
Swept my griefs and tears away
I'd never go back to cross that line
I cross my heart and hope to die...

"...I want no one to escape."
I hear the footsteps going by
Watching myself slowly die
Sharp pain impaling through my heart
Slowly tearing me apart
One minute you're an angel fallen from grace
Next, the fist that I hate
Pickin' me up from the gutter with a gentle kiss
Then rips out my heart to show me how black it is!
No!
You're no good!
It feels so cold
Yet I'm watching back!
I'll die alone!
I hear the footsteps walking by
Watching myself slowly die
Sharpening pain impaling through my heart
Slowly tearing me apart
When you appear as an angel
Knocking me down, looking my way
Could you ever kill the pain in my heart
Even though they say angels don't kill?
No!
You're no good!
It feels so cold
Yet I won't turn back!
I'll die alone!
No!
You're no good!
It feels so cold
Yet I won't turn back!
I'll die alone!!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I was born in ashes of molten hatred
Raised by demons in abodes of the dead
The Reaper's scythe I fall upon to light my path
Wrecked by mangled wounds of life
I have become become the resurrection of the Evil one
Y'know that I don't fucking care if I live or die
I need a bishop preaching fire
To get away with my sins
I despise everything I see
Ain't got respect for humanity
Never lived or wanted immortality
The Reaper's shadow I fall upon to obscure my path
Every day I'm being battered up until I bleed
You motherfuckas just leave me be
Ya could never give me cure for the pain I feel inside
I need a bishop preaching fire
To get away with my sins
I despise everything I see
I don't give a fuck if ya hate me!
Led by the Reaper I walk in the night
Show me the way to yer kingdom come
I believe in armageddon
I've been baptized in alcohol
Embodiment of Antichrist
I'm living for my own demise
I was born in ashes of molten hatred
Raised by the demons in abodes of the end
The Reaper's scythe I fall upon to obscure my path
Wrecked by mangled wounds of life
I have become the resurrection of the Evil one
Y'know that I don't fucking care if I live or die
I need a bishop preaching fire

Once again waiting for the darkness
Beat up, spun and scarred
Prepare for another war
Day by day we decay
Sunlight, get out of my way
Dig up yourself from your grave
Bad to the bone, raised in the gutter
Not exactly a motherfucking role model
To you looking down on me
FUCK YOU BITCH!
Ain't got time for the future or the past
Live for the moment, make it last
As long as the twilight veils
The decadence we embrace
More than the ones we love
We're ardent, we're burning down...
Not afraid of crying, sorrow and foe
Not afraid of falling down below
To the night, recklessly we fly
Like living dead, we'll never die
Stalling the sandman, fighting back
Drinking like a madman
Run away from the light to come
SHIT FALLS DOWN!
Sun comes up shining bright
Time to close your eyes..
Not afraid of crying, sorrow and foe
Not afraid of falling down below
To the night, recklessly we fly
Like living dead, we'll never die
As long as the twilight veils
The decadence we embrace
More than the ones we love
We're ardent, well burn it down
Not afraid of crying, sorrow and foe
Not afraid of falling down below
To the night, recklessly we fly

Flashback from the night before
Was it the other day? I couldn't say
It's all coming in pieces
But before you know they just fade away
God damn! What did I hear, what'd I do?
Where did I go and how'd I get here?
I know I'm too far gone
A deadbeat, a travesty
So what's my next strategy?

Fuck me, there's blood on my hands
That's nothing new but now they're shaking too
Everything's soaked in sweat
Here comes the "forgive and forget"
Who should I forgive? Forget that plan
I really don't give a damn
I just need my fix, I'm dying
So break out the bottle and stop crying

And the calm washes over
My soul drying my tears
Under the grass and clover
A new sense of hope appears
Choking
Breathing exhaust
Hard to keep an even keel
Shot
Boiling mercury
It burns so bad yet I can't feel

Choking
Breathing exhaust
Hard to keep an even keel
Shot
Boiling mercury
It burns so bad yet I can't feel
Walking
In a minefield
Hard to keep my eyes peeled
Shot
To Hell and fried
No Heaven evermore denied

And the calm washes over
My soul drying my tears
Under the grass and clover
A new sense of hope appearsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The night of timeless fire is drawing near
I flee...
Throughout the years of throe
Watching through a mirror, as I fall apart
I see a wreck, I'm burning
I see angels burning, falling down in ruins
Looking down I see me, I'm my own enemy
Watching myself decaying, (decaying)
Falling from high spirits
I flee...
Throughout the ruins of me
Longing for finding my way out
Leaving myself, there's nothing left for me
The ruins are about to crumble down
The flame is dying by shivery winds of jet black skies
It reflects hatred in my eyes
I see angels burning, falling down in ruins
Looking down, I see my ashes scattered around my grave
Angels whispering fire, no longer I'm alive
Settled down, I'm done with the trip to my kingdom come1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Go!
Pain ain't even really what you wanna be
5 feet under seeing your humanity
The opportunity to divide
The opportunity of being apart!!
Soon be there, the moon in the sky tonight
We're burning on a purified
Smash your face and then I beat it down
Are we really gonna die
Get up and fight, release your rage, come on and fight
Standing straight faced, it is your fate, calling my name
Calling me pain, and if you stay, you'll bite the scythe
Waiting for you I want to just tell you
If you want peace, prepare for war
Fuck!
Get up and fight, release your rage, come on and fight
Standing straight faced, it is your fate, calling my name
Calling me pain, and if you stay, you'll bite the scythe
Waiting for you I want to just tell you
Get up and fight, release your rage, come on and fight

When your hands have been tied
From front, back and from side to side
It's hard to see the shape of things to come
And the past becomes undone
No stars aligned to lead the blind
When your future is already declined

Lying, discarded
Dying, soon departed

Another morning, it’s hard to breathe
Waking up so damn confined
By these walls, cut, bruised and left behind
Another day and it hurts to burn your candles at all ends
No more looking and waiting for the godsends
You keep throwing away

If that is the life you choose
No circumstance can excuse
Why you run when you've passed
A dead end sign at long last
The days are numbered you swear
So you can start the countdown for all I care
Keep on telling yourself there's nothing left to do
Your story’s weak and so are you
Lying, discarded
Dying, soon departed

Another morning, it's hard to breathe
Waking up so damn confined
By these walls, cut, bruised and left behind
Another day and it hurts to burn your candles at all ends
No more looking and waiting for the godsends
You keep throwing away

Let's go!
That's it, where to go?
Should I tell you where I wanna go?
We'll die there be motherfucking there broad away to be
All wilted way, I'll show you the place where I wanna die
We're gonna die in pain
Don't hurt my eyes, I feel the flame
Sun's going down (...sun's going down)
Moon's rising high (...moon's rising high)
We'll pay you Bodom beach terror
Late night you party until it's light
While pointing at the sky
Wash your hands in the lake of your blood
Just before you die
Bodom beach terror!
To the place where you really wanna be, wanna go
From the dark away to hit lights, to hit that human light
One minute shape to hit time where you gonna go
I bet you're gonna hit ya to tear you down to a place you've never seen
Late night you party until it's light
While pointing at the sky
Wash your hands in the lake of your blood
Just before you die
Bodom beach terror!

Come on!

Hey! Don't tell us what you want
Cuz we don't give a fuck about you and your kind
You! You better take a step back
Where ever the fuck you came from
No! You ain't one of us and to be a tag along
You're too ugly and blunt
Why? Is it do hard to get
That we don't need you, stupid cunt!

If you don't know how to resent one another
To gain the new way
Of power, it'll get in to the point
Where no one gives a fuck what
You may think of us or what you may not

Stop! Are you ever gonna stop tryin'
To be on the way that we wanna go?
Fuck! It's pissing the fuck out of us
When you don't understand the word "no"!
Now, you're tellin' that you'll win the war
That's only battled cuz you're too dumb to die
That's right! You can take your war and shove it up your ass
Then close your eyes and say goodbye
If you don't know how to resent one another
To gain the new way
Of power, it'll get in to the point
Where no one gives a fuck what
You may think of us or what you may not

We're the Hate Crew, we stand and we won't fall...
We're all for none and none for all
Fuck You! We'll fight 'til the last hit
And we sure as hell ain't taking no shit!

Sometimes my pain is so damn elaborate
That I can taste the blood in my tears, trying to forget
They haunt me, taunt me
The dreams that are nothing but a cruel joke on me
I'll ride 'em out, yet I'm taut in actuality

Hexed
Turned into a casualty
Hexed
A blessing or a travesty?

Kill me once, who's to blame?
Kill me twice, I'm yours to claim
Curse me once, shame on you
Hex me twice, shame on me

If spirits could be visible, not just a fallacy
Your hex would be tangible but in reality
They haunt me, taunt me
Am I just a victim of my insanity?
A final chapter in a tale that ends in tragedy?
Hexed
Turned into a casualty
Hexed
A blessing or a travesty?
Hexed
Demon's within

I see the candle light burning in your eyes
Flaering up my eyes in flames
On this pitch-black summer night
Of passion and pain
The razor carressed my flesh and my arms turned red
I feel a vast desire
Years of pain are flowing down my arms, sweet, red, warm
Stream you drink
Make me released
Give me your hand let me make you feel the ease
In the bed of razors we bleed together
I feel the fire burning in my eyes
I see it sparkling in your eyes
The blaze you're feeding more and more
The razor carressed your flesh and your arms turned red

Tearing pain is flowing down your arms, sweet, red, warm
Stream I drink to make you realeased
Holding your arms cherish this composure

Awaiting the first sixpounder

Of shame and guilt

At the bridge he's lying
Waiting 'til light

No choice to go
Back where, he was
Okay to us
You're to come
And save me

Going down I walk
My way 'til now
Deep to the obscurity
Obliterating you in every way
With my life's insanity

Battered up again
I'm going right inside
Curled up on the floor
Wonder ways to kill the pain and
What doesn't kill you
Will only make you pissed off
Sweep back to kill
You can't make it go away
So let's take a shot at me
Just when you punch me, I bleed

Going down I walk
My way 'til now
Deep to the obscurity
Obliterating you in every way
With my life's insanity

No choice to go

Holding the key to my darkened past
She’s spinning with voices lost in past
The memory too disturbed
She’s a story that'll never end
You’re a two studded chain, a tear in my soul
She'll fly away with me when all said and done
But now she’s gone

I don’t believe in faith
The art of finding love
Refuse to let this cut me deep
Now to make her pay
Left to feel so numb
Yes, you may cut me again
But I mark these words with a blade that I’ll find you once again, Morrigan!

She’s the coming of my demise
In every way, seen her alluring disguise
A six-foot tall bloody, jet-black scythe
Is all that’s with me with the things I’ve done
Because she’s gone
I don’t believe in faith
The art of finding love
Refuse to let this cut me deep
Now to make her pay
Left to feel so numb
Yes, you may cut me again
But I mark these words with a blade that I’ll find you once again, Morrigan!

I ain't gonna leave from the post, so stay
On the way, get away from the twilight's scream
I refuse to let this cut me deep
I refuse to let this cut me deep!

I don’t believe in faith
The art of finding love
Refuse to let this cut me deep
Now to make her pay
Left to feel so numb
Yes, you may cut me again
But I mark these words with a blade that I'll find you once again, Morrigan!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
