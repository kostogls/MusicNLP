Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence?
One step from lashing out at you
You want in to get under my skin and call yourself a friend
I've got more friends like you, what do I do?

Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been, belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself by yourself, stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time

Respect, walk
What did you say?
Respect, walk
Are you talkin' to me?
Are you talkin' to me?

Run your mouth when I'm not around, it's easy to achieve
You cry to weak friends that sympathize
Can you hear the violins playing your song?
Those same friends tell me your every word
Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been, belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself by yourself, stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time

Respect, walk

Reverend, Reverend, is this some conspiracy?
Crucified for no sins, an image beneath me
What's within our plans for life, it all seems so unreal
I'm a man cut in half in this world left in my misery

The Reverend he turned to me without a tear in his eyes
Nothing new for him to see, I didn't ask him why
I will remember the love our souls had sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain, all my mind can see now is your

Well I guess you took my youth and gave it all away
Like the birth of a new-found joy, this love would end in rage
And when she died, I couldn't cry, the pride within my soul
You left me incomplete, all alone as the memories now unfold

Believe the word, I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me, some place far abound
I must reverse my life, I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free, belong to me at last
Through all those complex years, I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around and make this world my own
And when she died, I should have cried and spared myself some pain
You left me incomplete, all alone as the memories still remain

The way we were, the chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word, I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

The way we were, the chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word, I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery

If ever words were spoken painful and untrue
I said I loved but I lied
In my life, all I wanted
Was the keeping of someone like you
As it turns out, deeper within me
Love was twisted and pointed at you
Never ending pain, quickly ending life

You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love

I'd been the tempting one stole her from herself
This gift in pain, her pain was life
And sometimes I feel so sorry
I regret this the hurting of you
But you make me so unhappy
I'd take my life and leave love with you
I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself

You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love
No more head trips


You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love

You keep this love
You keep this love
You keep this love
You keep this love9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh, come on

Under the lights where we stand tall
Nobody touches us at all
Showdown, shootout
Spread fear within, without
I say we're gonna take what's ours to have
Spread the word throughout the land
They say the bad guys wear black
We're tagged and can't turn back

You see us coming and you all together run for cover
We're taking over this town

Here we come, reach for your gun
And you better listen well, my friend
You see, it's been slow down below
Aimed at you, we're the Cowboys from Hell
Deed is done, again we've won
Ain't talking no tall tales, friend
'Cause high noon, your doom
Coming for you, we're the Cowboys from Hell
Oh, pillage the village, trash the scene
But better not take it out on me
'Cause a ghost town is found
Where your city used to be
So out of the darkness and into the light
Sparks fly everywhere in sight
From my double barrel, 12 gauge
Can't lock me in your cage

You see us coming and you all together run for cover
We're taking over this town

Here we come, reach for your gun
And you better listen well, my friend
You see, it's been slow down below
Aimed at you, we're the Cowboys from Hell
Deed is done, again we've won
Ain't talking no tall tales, friend
'Cause high noon, your doom
Coming for you, we're the Cowboys from Hell

Here we come, reach for your gun
And you better listen well, my friend
You see, it's been slow down below
Aimed at you, we're the Cowboys from Hell
Deed is done, again we've won
Ain't talking no tall tales, friend

(First take like a motherfucker)

Agony is the price that you'll pay in the end
Domination consumes you, then calls you a friend
It's a twisted fall
Binds are like steel and manipulates the will to be
And it's hard to see
How soon we forget when there's nothing else left to destroy
It's a useless ploy

Your eyes will see the dawn of the day
And the writing on the wall
Those words that stare into your soul
And to yourself you will befall

It's domination pushed into living hell
Domination

A now blacked heart is reaching out in divinity
Bodies suspended by chains over razors and nails
It's a penalty
Each razor a vice and each nail marks demise of your life
Grim construction grows
Has life played a trick?
Sealed you in brick by brick till your end
Forcing you to bend
Your eyes will see the dawn of the day
And the writing on the wall
Those words that stare into your soul
And to yourself you will befall

It's domination pushed into living hell
Oh, domination3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I see you had your mind all made up
You group of pitiful liars
Before I woke to face the day
Your master plan transpired
Something told me
This job has more to meet the eye
My song is not believed?
My words somewhat deceiving?
Now I'm unwhole

You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are
Can't leave the scar
You cry for compensation
I ask you please just give us
Five minutes alone
Just give us
FIve minutes alone

I read your eyes, your mind was made up
You took me for a fool
You used complexion of my skin
For a counter racist tool
You can't burn me
I've spilled my guts out in the past
Taken advantage of
'Cause you know where I come from
My past
You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are
Can't leave the scar
Iâ€™ll bury your compensation

I wonder if we'll smile in our coffins
While loved ones mourn the day
The absence of our faces
Living, laughing, eyes awake
Is this too much for them to take?
Too young for one's conclusion, the lifestyle won
Such values you taught your son

That's how, that's how, that's how
Look at me now

I'm broken
Inherit my life
I'm broken

One day we all will die, a cliched fact of life
Force fed to make us heed
Inbred to sponge our bleed
Every warning, a leaking rubber
A poison apple for mingled blood
Too young for one's delusion, the lifestyle cost
Venereal mother embrace the loss
That's how, that's how, that's how
Look at you now

You're broken
Inherit your life

What's left inside him?
Don't he remember us?
Can't he believe me?
We seemed like brothers
Talked for hours last month
About what we wanna be
I sit now with his hand in mine
But I know he can't feel

No one knows
What's done is done
It's as if he were dead

I'm close with his mother
And she cries endlessly
Lord how we miss him
At least what's remembered
It's so important to make best friends in life
But it's hard when my friend sits with blank expressions

No one knows
What's done is done
It's as if he were dead
He as hollow as I alone now
He as hollow as I alone now

He as hollow as I alone
A shell of my friend
Just flesh and bone
There's no soul
He sees no love
I shake my fists at skies above
Mad
At God

I wish he'd waken from this curse
Hear my words before it's through

Revenge, I'm screaming revenge again
Wrong, I've been wrong for far too long
Been constantly so frustrated
I've moved mountains with less
When I channel my hate to productive
I don't find it hard to impress

Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous
My ears can't hear what you say to me

Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for
Speak the truth about me
Determined

Possessed, I feel a conquering will down inside me
Strength, the strength of many to crush who might stop me
My strength is in number
And my soul lies in every one
The releasing of anger can better any medicine under the sun
Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous
My ears can't hear what you say to me

Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for
Speak the truth about me
Determined


There comes a time within everyone
To close your eyes to what's real

No comprehension to fail
I vacuum the wind for my sail
Can't be the rest
Let others waste my time
Owning success is the bottom line
Like a knife into flesh
After life is to death
Pulling and punching the rest of duration
No one can piss on this determination8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Cheap cocaine, a dry inhale
The pills that kill and take the pain away (Take the pain away)
Diet of life, shelter without
The face that cannot see inside yours and mine (Yours and mine)

For our handle on this life

Can you tell I'm a man? (Can you tell I'm a man?)
With these scars on my wrists

Forever fooling, free and using
Sliding down the slide that breaks a will (Breaks a will)
Mother's angel, getting smarter

One, two, three, four

Almost every day
I see the same face
On broken picture tube
It fits the attitude
If you could see yourself
You put you on a shelf
Your verbal masturbate
Promise to nauseate
Today I'll play the part of non-parent
Not make a hundred rules
For you to know about yourself
Not lie and make you believe what's evil
Is making love and making friends
And meeting God your own way, the right way

To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us
Ah, fucking hostile!
We stand alone
The truth in right and wrong
The boundaries of the law
You seem to miss the point
Arresting for a joint?
You seem to wonder why
Hundreds of people die
You're writing tickets man
My mom got jumped they ran
Now I'll play a public servant
To serve and protect
By the law and the state
I'd bust the punks
That rape steal and murder
And leave you be
If you crossed me, I'd shake your hand like a man
Not a God

To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us
Ah, fucking hostile!
We stand alone

Come meet your maker, boy
Some things you can't enjoy
Because of heaven, hell
A fucking wives' tale
They put it in your head
Then put you in your bed
He's watching, say your prayers
'Cause God is everywhere
Now I'll play a man learning priesthood
About to take the ultimate test in life
I question things because I am human
And call no one my father who's no closer that a stranger
I won't listen

To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us

Out of my mind, gun up to the mouth
No pretension, execution
Live and learn, rape and turn
Fret not family, nor pre-judged army
This is for me, and me only
Cowards only try it

Don't you try to die, like me
It's livid and its lies and makes graves descending

It's not worth the time to try
To replenish a rotting life
I'll end the problem, facing nothing
Fuck you off, fuck you all
Tortured history, addict of misery, this exposes me
For weakness is a magnet - watch me do it, do it

Don't you try to die, like me
It's livid and it's lies
Makes graves descending down

Why would you help anyone who doesn't want it?
Doesn't need it, doesn't want your shit advice
When a mind's made up to go ahead and die
What's done is done and gone, so why cry?

Transfusion with somebody
Morose and old
Drop into fruitless dying

The whoring angel rising
Now burning prayers
My silent time of losing

Colliding slow, like life itself

Long for the blur
We cannot dry much longer
Cement to dirt
Disgusted with my cheapness

Demanding plea for unity between us all
United stand
Death before divided fall
In mock military order
Vulgar power
Impatient because time is shorter

While you snored and drooled, I fucked your love
She called me Daddy
And I called her baby when I smacked her ass
I called her sugar when I ate her alive till daylight
And I slept with her all over me
From forehead to rib cage I dripped her ass

Living out some brash fantasy, but no
You were knocked out
But we were all knocked out you know

We didn't know you'd break the bottle
That the magic came in to use those jagged shards
To cut our wrists and neck
And you'd do it too, you're that kind of dude
But you wouldn't know what you were doing
Because I didn't
Your girlfriend could have been a burn victim
An amputee, a dead body
But god damn I wanted to fuck

Because of ignorant past burnt fires
From evolution we've been killing each other
I figure man should have it down to a science
No chance, not for a minute, not for a second

For the mere fact that you feel inferior
Be superior and know your interior

Race, pride, prejudice
Black man, white man, no stand
Live in the past, we make it last
A hated mass
No solution, mind pollution
For revolution

So low behold my eyes
This land of fools will rise
No good for no-one
You're no good for no-one
You blame oppression and play the role of criminals
To rape and burn shows progress is minimal
White hoods and militants, you know it's such a pity
Living, breathing, violence in your city
If one man had one home in one world
He'd live alone without variety, full of anxiety
No-one to point at, question or even talk to in his private grave
No matter what colour, he wouldn't be saved from Hell, he dwells
A closed mind playing the part of prison cells
