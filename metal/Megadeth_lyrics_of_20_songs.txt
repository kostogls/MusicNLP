Part 1: Holy Wars...


Brother will kill brother, spilling blood across the land
Killing for religion, something I don't understand
Fools like me who cross the sea and come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep for their beliefs, "do you kill on God's command?"
A country that's divided surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace, no foolish naive stand
The end is near, it's crystal clear, part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel, it might be your homeland
Holy wars...

Upon my podium as the “know-it-all” scholar
Down in my seat of judgement, gavel's bang, uphold the law
Upon my soapbox, a leader out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the “holier-than-thou-could-be-messenger” of God
Part 2: ...The Punishment Due

Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, rappel down the rocks, behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me, some people live to destroy me
Either way, they die... they die!
They killed my wife and my baby, with hopes to enslave me
First mistake... last mistake!
Paid by the alliance to slay all the giants
Next mistake... no more mistakes!


Fill the cracks in with judicial granite
Because I don't say it, don't mean I ain't thinking it
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings
Mercy killings, mercy killings, killings, killings, killings

Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away44EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Don't remember where I was
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became
I had no idea what it'd cost
My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans, denied

So, as you read this, know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Smile when you think of me
My body's gone, that's all

À tout le monde, à tous mes amis
Je vous aime, je dois partir
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

If my heart was still alive
I know it would surely break
And my memories left with you
There's nothing more to say
Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
And the living all are scarred
À tout le monde, à tous mes amis
Je vous aime, je dois partir
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free


So, as you read, know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile, smile when you think about me
My body's gone, that's all

À tout le monde, à tous mes amis

These are the last words I'll ever speak

À tout le monde, à tous mes amis

This morning I made the call
The one that ends it all
Hanging up, I wanted to cry
But dammit, this well's gone dry
Not for the money
Not for the fame
Not for the power
Just no more games

But now I'm safe in the eye of a tornado
I can't replace the lies that let a thousand days go
No more living trapped inside, in her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away

You'll grow to loathe my name
You'll hate me just the same
You won't need your breath
And soon you'll meet your death
Not from the years
Not from the use
Not from the tears
Just self-abuse
But now I'm safe in the eye of a tornado
I can't replace the lies that let a thousand days go
No more living trapped inside, in her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away

Who's to say what's for me to say?
Who's to say what's for me to be?
Who's to say what's for me to do?
'Cause a big nothing it'll be for me

The land of opportunity
The golden chance for me
My future looks so bright
Now I think I've seen the light

Can't say what's on my mind
Can't do what I really feel
In this bed I made for me
Is where I sleep, I really feel
I warn you of the fate
Proven true too late
Your tongue twists perverse
Come drink now of this curse
And now I fill your brain
I spin you round again
My poison fills your head
As I tuck you into bed
You'll feel my fingertips
You won't forget my lips
You'll feel my cold breath
It's the kiss of death23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You take a mortal man
And put him in control
Watch him become a god
Watch people's heads a'roll
A'roll, a'roll...

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony of destruction

Actin' like a robot
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head explodes
Explodes, explodes...

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Swaying to the symphony of destruction

The Earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
A'warring for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
A'tall, a'tall...

Just like the Pied Piper

What do you mean I "don't believe in God?"
I talk to him every day
What do you mean I "don't support your system?"
I go to court when I have to
What do you mean I "can't get to work on time?"
Got nothing better to do
And, what do you mean I "don't pay my bills?"
Why, do you think I'm broke? Huh?

If there's a new way, I'll be the first in line
But it better work this time

What do you mean I "hurt your feelings?"
I didn't know you had any feelings
What do you mean I "ain't kind?"
I'm just not your kind
What do you mean I "couldn't be the president
Of the United States of America?"
Tell me something
It's still "we the people," right?
If there's a new way, I'll be the first in line
But it better work this time


Can you put a price on peace?

Peace, peace sells

In my hour of need
Heh, no, you're not there
And though I reached out for you
Wouldn't lend a hand
Through the darkest hour
Your grace did not shine on me
Feels so cold, very cold
No one cares for me

Did you ever think I'd get lonely?
Did you ever think that I needed love?
Did you ever think to stop thinking?
You're the only one that I'm thinking of
You'll never know how hard I tried
To find my space and satisfy you too

Things will be better
When I'm dead and gone
Don't try to understand
Knowing you, I'm probably wrong
But, oh, how I lived my life for you
Still you'd turn away
Now, as I die for you
My flesh still crawls as I breathe your name
All these years, I thought I was wrong
Now I know it was you
Raise your head, raise your face, your eyes
Tell me who you think you are

I walk, I walk alone
Into the promised land
There's a better place for me
But it's far, far away
Everlasting life for me
In a perfect world
But I gotta die first
Please, God, send me on my way


Time has a way of taking time
Loneliness is not only felt by fools
Alone, I call to ease the pain
Yearning to be held by you, alone
So alone, I'm lost
Consumed by the pain
The pain, the pain, the pain
Won't you hold me again?
You just laughed, ha, ha, you bitch
My whole life is work built on the past
But the time has come when all things shall pass
This good thing passed away18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hello, me, meet the real me and my misfits way of life
A dark, black past is my most valued possession
Hindsight is always 20-20
But looking back, it's still a bit fuzzy
Speak of mutually assured destruction
Nice story, tell it to Reader's Digest

Feeling paranoid, true enemy or false friend?
Anxiety's attacking me and my air is getting thin
I'm in trouble for the things I haven't got to yet
I'm chomping at the bit and my palms are getting wet
Sweating bullets

Hello, me, it's me again
You can subdue, but never tame me
It gives me a migraine headache, sinking down to your level
Yeah, just keep on thinking it's my fault
And stay an inch or two out of kicking distance
Mankind has got to know his limitations

Feeling claustrophobic like the walls are closing in
Bloodstains on my hands and I don't know where I've been
I'm in trouble for the things I haven't got to yet
I'm sharpening the axe and my palms are getting wet
Sweating bullets

I hear it in here...
Blood stains on my... hands
The big axe...
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...
Sweating, sweating
Sweating, sweating
Sweating, sweating

Well, me, it's nice talking to myself
A credit to dementia
Someday, you too, will know my pain
And smile its black-toothed grin
If the war inside my head won't take a day off, I'll be dead
My icy fingers claw your back
Here I come again

Feeling paranoid, true enemy or false friend?
Anxiety's attacking me, and my air is getting thin
Feeling claustrophobic like the walls are closing in
Bloodstains on my hands and I don't know where I've been
Once you've committed me (Committed me)
Now you've acquitted me (Acquitted me)
Claiming validity (Validity)
For your stupidity (Stupidity)
I'm chomping at the bit
I'm sharpening the axe
Oh, here I come again, whoa!

Welcome to our fortress tall
I'll take some time to show you around
Impossible to break these walls
For, you see, the steel is much too strong
Computer banks to rule the world
Instruments to sight the stars

Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18, I know too much


Foreign life forms, inventory
Suspended state of cryogenics
Selective amnesia's the story
Believed, foretold, but who would suspect?
The military intelligence
Two words combined that can't make sense

Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18, I know too much

Part 1: Rust in Peace

Tremble, you weaklings, cower in fear
I am your ruler - land, sea, and air
Immense in my girth, erect I stand tall
I am a nuclear murderer, I am Polaris
Ready to pounce at the touch of a button
My system's locked in on military gluttons
I rule on land, air, and sea
I pass judgement on humanity
Winds blow from the bowels of Hell
Will we give warning? Only time will tell
Satan rears his ugly head
To spit into the wind

I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils

Launch the Polaris
The end doesn't scare us
When will this cease?
The warheads will all rust in peace
Bomb shelters filled to the brim
Heh, survival, such a silly whim
World leaders sell missiles cheap
Your stomach turns, your flesh creeps
I rule on land, air, and sea
Pass judgment on humanity
Winds blow from the bowels of Hell
Will we give warning? Only time will tell

I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils

Launch the Polaris
The end doesn't scare us
When will this cease?
The warheads will all rust in peace

High priest of holocaust, fire from the sea
Nuclear winter, spreading disease
The day of final conflict, all pay the price
The third world war rapes peace, takes life
Back to the start, talk of the part
When the Earth was cold as ice
Total dismay as the sun passed away
And the days were black as night
I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils

Launch the Polaris
It doesn't scare us
When will this cease?
The warheads will all rust in peace

Bestow upon me knowledge
Wizard, all-knowing, all-wise
I want to rule this kingdom
Make sweet the breeze, now defiled
Dethrone the evil prince's iron fists
In velvet gloves of sin
Parade the grey-robed monks
The vestal virgins wheel the wyvern's in


Let the ceremony consecrate the marriage
Let me be the protégé of five magics
Give me alchemy, give me wizardry
Give me sorcery, thermatology
Electricity, magic if you please
Master all of these, bring him to his knees

I master five magics

Imagine you were at my station
And you brought your motor to me
You're a burner, yeah, a real motor car

Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, y'know, lucky for you

Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me?

Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat

"What you don’t know," the legend goes, "can't hurt you"
If you only want to live and die in fear
They tell us to believe just half of what we see
And absolutely nothing that we hear
Resist the twisted truth no matter what the cost
Supplant the rights with wrongs inside our heads
Outlawing all the questions to the answers
That no one likes when someone ends up dead

Dystopia

"What you don’t know," the legend goes, "can't hurt you"
If you only want to live and die in a cage
There's panic and there's chaos rampant in the streets
Where useless thoughts of peace are met with rage
Demoralized and overmastered people think
The quickest way to end a war is lose
Dictatorship ends starting with tyrannicide
You must destroy the cancer at its root

Lost in a dream, nothing's what it seems
Searching my head for the words that you said
Tears filled my eyes as we said our last goodbyes
This sad scene replays of you walking away

My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust

Time and again she repeats "Let's be friends."
I smile and say "Yes"
Another truth bends, I must confess
I try to let go, but I know we'll never end 'til we're dust
We lied to each other again (I wish I could trust)
But I wish I could trust

My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
God, help me please, on my knees (on my knees)
Betrayed by lust (by lust)
We lied to each other so much (so much)
Now there's nothing we trust
"How could this be happening to me?"
"I'm lying when I say 'Trust me'."
"I can't believe this is true..."
"Trust hurts."
"Why does trust equal suffering?"

Welcome to our sanguinary sect of worship
Feel at home in our black conventicle
As we anathematise all those who oppose us

Don't summon the Devil, don't call the priests
If you need the strength, the conjuring
Obey!


Behold, the flames rise from the compass' cardinal points
Burn the sacred oil, and with the ashes you'll anoint

Arrange the symbols of the wizard and magician
Light the candles, place the parchment paper in position
Between its leaves place the lash from a black cat's eye
A straw of a broom, fold, and burn, and centralize

Don't summon the Devil, don't call the priests
If you need the strength, then conjure me

I am the Devil's advocate
A salesman if you will
You know my name, you know my name

I met your father years ago
I gave him what he'd please
He called my name, and you'll do the same

I'm claiming what is mine by right
It's time to close the deal
You're bought and sold, bought and sold

Come join me in my infernal depths
Mephisto's hall of fame
I've got your soul, I've got your soul

Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight

An ego boost, don't think twice
Technology, the battle's unfair
You pull the hammer without a care
Squeeze the trigger that makes you man
Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned
The hunt is canned...

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one

Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare
The skin and trophy, oh so rare
Silence speaks louder than words
Ignore the guilt, and take your turn
Liars' anagram is "lairs"
Man, you were never even there
Killed a few feet from the cages
Point blank, you're so courageous
So courageous...

A cockroach in the concrete, courthouse tan and beady eyes
A slouch with fallen arches, purging truths into great lies
A little man with a big eraser, changing history
Procedures that he's programmed to, all he hears and sees
Altering the facts and figures, events and every issue

Bodies convulse in agony and pain
I mangle their faces, 'til no features remain
A blade for the butchering, I cut them to shreds
First take out the organs, then cut off the head
The remains of the flesh now sop under my feet
One more bloody massacre, the murder's complete
I seek to dismember, a sadist fiend
Bloodbath's my way of gettin' clean

I lurk in the alley, wait for the kill
I have no remorse for the blood that I spill
A merciless butcher who lives underground
I'm out to destroy and I will cut you down
Cut you down

Sitting up late at night
I tiptoe through the darkness
Cold as Hell, black as spades
Aware of my immediate surroundings
In my place, I escape
Up into my hideout
Hiding from everyone
My friends all say "Dave, you're mental anyway." (Hey!)
Drift into a deeper state
I stalk the cobwebbed stairways
Dirt grits beneath my feet
The stair creaks, I precariously sneak, hey

Hypnosis guides my hand
I slip-slide through the walkways
Sit in Granny's rocking chair
Memories are whirling by (Yeah!)
Reminiscing in the attic
Lucretia waits impatiently
Cobwebs make me squint
The cobra so eloquently glints
Moonbeams surge through the sky
The crystal ball is energised
Surely that, like the cat
Waiting, Lucretia rocks away (Hey!)

I don't want to set the world on fire...

Red flash, clouds choking out the morning sky
They said it'd never come, we knew it was a lie
All forms of life die now, the humans all succumb
Time to kiss your ass goodbye, the end has just begun

Distorted figures walk the street, it's 1999
Weeds once underneath your feet have grown to vines
Bodies melted like a candle, a land without a face
No time to change your fate, no time left, it's too late

The arsenal of megadeath can't be rid they said
And if it comes, the living will envy the dead
Racing for power, and all come in last
No winning, first stone cast
This falsehood, worldly peace
Its treaties soon will cease

No one will be left to prove that humans existed
Maybe soon the children will be born open-fisted
We all live on one planet it will all go up in smoke
Too bad they couldn't see this lethal energy
And now the final scene, a global darkening


Dig deep, piles of rubble and ruins
Towering overhead both far and wide
There's unknown tools for World War III
Einstein said "We'll use rocks on the other side."
No survivors
Set the world afire

No survivors, set the world afire6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
