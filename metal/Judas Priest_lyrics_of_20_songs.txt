Faster than a bullet, terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger, he's half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster, breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller

Planets devastated, mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies in answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder, blasting bolts of steel
Evil's going under deadly wheels

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Oh!

Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns

Flying high on rapture, stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured, they've been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected, forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Wings of steel Painkiller
Deadly wheels Painkiller
Ah!


He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Pain! Pain! Killer! Killer!
Pain! Pain! Killer! Killer!

Can't stop the painkiller!

There I was completely wasting, out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
So I might as well begin to put some action in my life

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

So much for the golden future, I can't even start
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart
You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue
If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

You don't know what it's like

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

Breaking the law, breaking the law

One life I'm gonna live it up
I'm takin' flight I said I'll never get enough
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud
I'm on top as long as the music's loud

If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
If you think I'll let it go, you're mad
You've got another thing comin'

You've got another thing comin'

That's right, here's where the talkin' ends
Well listen this night there'll be some action spent
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks

If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
If you think I'll let it go, you're mad
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'

In this world we're livin' in, we have our share of sorrow
Answer now is don't give in, aim for a new tomorrow


Oh, so hot, no time to take a rest, yeah
Act tough, ain't room for second best
Real strong, got me some security
Hey, I'm a big smash, I'm goin' for infinity, yeah

If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die

Up here in space, I’m looking down on you
My lasers trace everything you do
You think you’ve private lives, think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape, I’m watching all the time

I’m made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

I’m elected electric spy
I’m protected electric eye

Always in focus, you can’t feel my stare
I zoom into you, but you don’t know I’m there
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove

I’m made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I’m elected electric spy
I’m protected electric eye


Electric eye, in the sky
Feel my stare, always there
There’s nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows

I’m made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

I’m elected electric spy
I’m protected electric eye

He had enough, he couldn't take anymore
He found a place in his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried, they couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him, fed him by hand

Yeah, I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life, I'll decide not you

Withdrawn he'd sit there, stare blank into space
No sign of life would flicker on his face
Until one day he smiled, it seemed as though with pride
The wind kissed him goodbye, and then he died

Yeah, I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life, I'll decide not you

Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for living in
Yeah! I will start again
It can take forever and ever and ever and ever
But I shall win

How many like him are there still?
But to us, all seem to have lost the will
They lie in thousands, plagued and lost
Is nothing worth this bitter cost?

Yeah, I've left the world behind

Whiskey woman, don't you know that you are drivin' me insane?
The liquor you give stems your will to live and gets right to my brain
Don't you know you're driving me insane?
You're tryin' to find your way through life
You're tryin' to get some new direction
Another woman's got her man
But she won't find no new connection

Takes another drink or two
Things look better when she's through

Take another look around, you're not going anywhere
You've realized you're gettin' old and no one seems to care
You're tryin' to find your way again
You're tryin' to get some new
Another woman's got her man
But she won't get a new

Takes another drink or two
Things look better when she's through

You've been foolin' with some hot guy
I want to know why is it why
Get up, get out, you know you really blew it
I've had enough, I've had enough, good God, pluck me

Once she was wonderful
Once she was fine
Once she was beautiful
Once she was mine, she was mine
Change has come over her body
She doesn't see me anymore
Now change has come over her body
She doesn't see me anymore

Changes

Standing by my window, breathing summer breeze
Saw a figure floating, 'neath the willow tree
Asked us if we were happy, we said we didn't know
Took us by the hands and up we go

We followed the dreamer through the purple hazy clouds
He could control our sense of time
We thought we were lost but no matter how we tried
Everyone was in peace of mind

We felt the sensations drift inside our frames
Finding complete contentment there
And all the tensions that hurt us in the past
Just seemed to vanish in thin air

He said in the cosmos is a single sonic sound
That is vibrating constantly
And if we could grip and hold on to the note
We would see our minds were free, oh they're free

We are lost above
Floating way up high
If you think you can find a way
You can surely try

Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

I took the city 'bout one A.M, loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right

Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break

Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm aiming for you
I'm gonna floor you
My body's coming
All night long

The air's electric, sparking power, loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin

Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning

You won't hear me, but you'll feel me
Without warning, something's dawning, listen
Then within your senses
You'll know you're defenseless
How your heart beats when you run for cover
You can't retreat, I spy like no other
Then we'll race together
We can ride forever
Wrapped in horsepower, driving into fury
Changing gear I pull you tighter to me

I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover

We hold each other closer
As we shift to overdrive
And everything goes rushing by
With every nerve alive
We move so fast it seems as though
We've taken to the sky
Love machines in harmony
We hear the engines cry
I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover


On and on we're charging
To the place so many seek
In perfect synchronicity
Of which so many speak
We feel so close to heaven
In this roaring heavy load
And then in sheer abandonment
We shatter and explode

I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover
I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover

Howling winds keep screaming around
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town

Straight out of Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night crawler
You know he's coming back
Night crawler

Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers our last resort
Homing in its cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught

Straight out of Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night crawler
You know he's coming back
Night crawler


As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind

Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
"Come to me" it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descends the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood
Straight out of Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night crawler
You know he's coming back

He's going to get you

I'll bring you the head of the demon
I'm peeling the skin from his face
The life that you lead is inhuman
Its cause and effects a disgrace

You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell

Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike (Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike

Twisted dreams that are born from delusion
The collusion of fear and torment
Decimating to stem this contusion
With a power-mad freaking intent

You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons lie dead where they fell
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike (Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike

I'll spin the world around reeling
I have to when mankind's at stake
I might be left broken and bleeding
For it's all in the fight that we make


You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons still tolling the bell

Invincible through every storm
Bring in the foe to be defeated
To pulverize from dusk till dawn

We're forged by evil to compel
Come rally round this lack of freedom
Our union thrives, so go to Hell

Empty the chamber
Lock and reload
This world thrives on danger
It's bound to explode
Aim for the target

Releasing the trigger

No time to pray or ask forgiveness
Those blessed souls are now deceased
There is no sense in this contrition
With open arms we fight for peace

I'm laying awake at nights
I can't get you out of my mind
All I can hear is my heartbeat
And the voice in the dark of some kind

Where are you now?
The fears are coming back to me once again
Oh, I wish you were here
Taking good care of me
I want you
I feel as though I'm out in the cold

Out in the cold
Hear me calling, cold
Out in the cold
Please rescue me

I know it was you I hurt, I didn't mean to hurt you
So much to forgive and forget
Can't take anymore of this hurt (oh no, oh no)
There's so many things I regret
Where are you now?
The fears are coming back to me once again
Oh, I wish you were here
Taking good care of me
I want you
I feel as though I'm out in the cold

Shut me out
Out in the cold
Where are you now?
Hear me calling
I need you, I'm so cold
Can't you hear my heartbeat?
Out in the cold
Please rescue me

Give me a chance baby
Ah there's nothing I wouldn't do to make it alright
Just one more chance baby
I need all your loving tonight

Hey, listen, don't you let them get your mind
Fill your brain with orders and that's not right
They're playing out a game that draws you closer
Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear
Always taking, baby, but that's okay
What they're giving maybe it's out of phase with me
Told you once, you're never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face

We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace

Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you round in the torture before the dread
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter
As the sweat is running down your neck
All you're praying for is to stop your body breaking up
Oh, your heart is pumping, gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace


So you wait it out and bide your time
Rip off that straight jacket, you gotta break that line
Everyone who wins in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake
I don't talk about it, but that's all right
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight
If it takes forever, then I tell you I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate

We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace

Screaming, screaming vengeance

Angel, put sad wings around me now
Protect me from this world of sin
So that we can rise again

Oh angel, we can find our way somehow
Escaping from the world we're in
To a place where we began

And I know we'll find, a better place and peace of mind
Just tell me that it's all you want, for you and me
Angel won't you set me free

Angel remember how we'd chase the sun
Then reaching for the stars at night
As our lives had just begun

When I close my eyes, I hear your velvet wings and cry
I'm waiting here with open arms, oh, can't you see
Angel shine your light on me

Angel we'll meet once more, I'll pray
When all my sins are washed away
Hold me inside your wings and stay
Oh, angel take me far away

Deadly as the viper peering from its coil
The poison there is coming to the boil
Ticking like a time bomb, the fuse is running short
On the verge of snapping if it's caught

And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
It's ready to explode
Jawbreaker

Crouching in the corner wound up as a spring
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering
Muscles are all contorted claws dug in the dirt
Every ounce of fiber on alert

And all the pressure that's been building up

I made a spike about nine o'clock on a Saturday
All eyes hit me as I walked into the bar
And seeing other guys were fooling in the denim dudes
A couple cards played rough stuff, New York, fire island
I cased the joint, straining at the scenes

I moseyed up to the counter and the tender came a-grinnin'
I snapped the smile off his face and scowled "Give me a bourbon"
The mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting
All the heavy bodies ducking, stealing eager for some action
The scene screwed me up, I saw some contact
Then the big boys saw me and knew that

I'd had too much, floating around
Statues alive, seconds are hours


Sacks like a hurricane, wrapped in and shattered
I was barely holding on to this flying body symphony
I guess I dream in pictures, not colours
The true free expression I demand is human rights, right
I gave my life, I am immortal
I'm going, no loss
I'm going, no loss
I'm going, no loss
I'm going, no loss

Nightmare, just a bunch of goddamn, rotten, steaming
