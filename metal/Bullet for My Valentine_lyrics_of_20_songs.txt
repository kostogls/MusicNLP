Let's go!

With bloodshot eyes, I watch you sleeping
The warmth I feel beside me is slowly fading
Would she hear me, if I called her name?
Would she hold me, if she knew my shame?

There's always something different going wrong
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?

Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home

The moments die, I hear no screaming
The visions left inside me are slowly fading
Would she hear me, if I called her name?
Would she hold me, if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going wrong!
The path I walk's in the wrong direction!
There's always someone fucking hanging on!
Can anybody help me make things better?

Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home
Oh!
Yeah!

This battered room I've seen before
The broken bones they heal no more, no more
With my last breath I'm choking
Will this ever end? I'm hoping
My world is over, one more time!
Let's go!

Would she hear me, if I called her name?
Would she hold me, if she knew my shame?

There's always something different going wrong!
The path I walk's in the wrong direction!
There's always someone fucking hanging on!
Can anybody help me make things better?

Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home (tears don't fall)
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me (conscience calls)
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come
Better!
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me (conscience calls)
Her conscience calls, the guilty to come home!34EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I don't understand just why you wanna keep me guessing
What I've done or what I've said to make, make you feel this way
I get the feeling this is never getting any better

Seems to me we need to draw a line for everybody's sake
Before it washes us away

First you wanna hate me, then you wanna love me
This is how I'm feeling, I'm just letting you know
Don't wanna hear it, I ain't gonna fake it
This is how I'm feeling, now I'm letting you go
Coldest heart I've ever known, now I'm better off alone
First you wanna love me, then you wanna hate me
This is how I'm feeling now I'm letting you, letting you go

So I know this hasn't gone the way that we expected
You had to try and make a fool of me and leave a bitter taste
I try to compromise with open eyes but we're disconnected

Seems to me we need to draw a line for everybody's sake
Before it washes us away
(First you wanna hate me)
First you wanna hate me, then you wanna love me
This is how I'm feeling, I'm just letting you know

So now this ship is sinking
I don’t know what to do
It’s got me thinking that I don’t need
Don’t need you
Too many wrong decisions
You didn’t think this through
So what I’m saying is I don’t need
Don’t need you

Open your eyes and see
What we have become
This isn’t living, it’s existing
And I just can’t take this shit
And hurt anymore
Hurt anymore

So bury me with all you got
It never stops, never ends, gotta try and
Let it out, let it go
Is this the end?
‘Cause it might just break me

Look at us now, we’re fucked
And nothing’s the same
The biggest piece of me is missing and I just can’t
Take this life or try anymore
I just don’t care so come and...

Bury me with all that you've got

Oh!

There goes my valentine again
Soaked in red for what she said
And now she's gone!
Oh my god have I done it again?!
There's a pulse and it's deafening!
I can't help what I hear in my head!
It's the switch that I flick (When it says)

Hand of blood!
I don't want to feel, my heart is breaking
Hand of blood!
I don't want to see, my life is burning!

I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take
Or are you blind and seeing nothing?
(I saw you run!) I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take
Or are you scared of being nothing?
There's a stain on my hand and it's red!
Oh my god, am I losing it?
I can't help what I've done or I've said
It's the button I push (When it says)

Hand of blood!
I don't want to feel, my heart is breaking
Hand of blood!
I don't want to see, my life is burning!

I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take
Or are you blind and seeing nothing?
(I saw you run!) I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take
Or are you scared of being nothing?

No!

I'm coming home!
I've been gone for far too long!
Do you remember me at all?
I'm leaving
Have I fucked things up again?
I'm dreaming
Too much time without you spent!

It hurts!
Wounds so sore!
Now I'm torn
Now I'm torn

I've been far away
When I see your face
My hearts burst into fire!
Hearts burst into fire!

You're not alone
I know I'm far from home!

No more days without you spent

My bed's so cold, so lonely
No arms, just sheets to hold me
Has this world stopped turning?
Are we forever to be apart?

Am I going insane?
My blood is boiling inside of my veins
An evil feeling attacks (attacks)
My body's shaking, there's no turning back
Don't take your eyes off the trigger!
I'm not to blame if your world turns to black
As your eyes start to blister!
There's just no hope for our final embrace

So here we are
I'm in your head
I'm in your heart!

You were told to run away
Soak the place, and light the flame
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal!
I was told to stay away
Those two words I can't obey
Pay the price for your betrayal
Your betrayal, your betrayal!

Is it my turn to die?
My heart is pounding as I say goodbye
So now I dance in the flames
I love you crying and screaming my name
You said that we'd be forever!
How could you kill me and lie to my face?
Now that we can't be together!
There's just no hope for our final embrace
So here we are
I'm in your head
I'm in your heart!

We will not take this anymore
These words will never be ignored
You want a battle
Here's a war

Down eyes of shame
Made to feel dead again
Your words cut deep
Your lies are fueled by your need for deceit
Too scared to speak
You're only alive when you torture the weak
Now hear me roar

I will not take this anymore
These words will never be ignored
You want a battle
Here's a war!
I will not take this anymore
These words will never be ignored

Don't be afraid
No remorse, no restraint
These scars won't heal
Now you're the victim I'm making you feel
Like you are me

Can you hear me roar?

After all this time
You still couldn't recognize
That your problem lies within
In a vicious circle
Can you tell me why?
Why you've thrown it all away
'Cause it makes no sense to me
Why you wouldn't listen

I know it hurts
I tried to help to ease your pain
I know these words
They won't mean anything
I hope it hurts
You've only got yourself to blame
And I can't take this anymore
I'm over it
So over it

Watching you decline
What were you expecting
I can't save you from yourself
When you don't want saving
It's on your head!
Don't point the finger point the blame!
'Cause the warning signs were clear
You just wouldn't listen
I know it hurts
I tried to help to ease your pain
I know these words
They won't mean anything
I hope it hurts
You've only got yourself to blame
And I can't take this anymore

Breathe in breathe out
I feel it coming round again
Breathe in breathe out
Don't wanna ride your carousel
Breathe in breathe out
Don't know how much more I can take
Breathe in breathe out
Just stop 'cause I'm about to break

I know it hurts
Tried to help to ease your pain

They won't mean anything

Helpless!
My eyes are bleeding from the fear that's inside!
You sealed your demise when you
Took what was mine
Don't try to stop me from avenging this world!
No voice to be heard!

Waking the demon!
Where'd you run to?
Walking in shadows!
Watch the blood flow
There's not much longer, so don't try and fight
Your body's weakening, walk to the light
Those painful times so alone, so ashamed
I'm not coming back, there's nothing to gain!
Caution!
There's just no limit to the boundaries you push!
I've warned you but still you just
Fuck with my mind!
There's no escape from this rage that I feel!
Nothing is real!

Too many cuts and too many broken bones
Draining the life, burying skeletons
Do or die, is this the feeling I'm craving?
Waiting for life to ignite
Is this the moment for taking?
A leap of faith, I'll...

Jump into the fire, no fear
Taken to the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in

The beat of a pulse, feeling it resonate
Into the night, hearing it fade away
Do or die, this is choice that I’m making
Feels like I’m living a lie
This is the moment for taking
A leap of faith I’ll...

Taken to the edge but it still can’t break me

Your final breath is my possession
Obsession (obsession), rejection (rejection)
Your final breath is now my possession

Ten thousand times (times)
I've tried (I've tried), I've tried to hate you
Forget your pretty little lies
It's time for me to make you hurt
So answer me, talk to me
So answer me, where's your empathy?
You pour your salt into my wounds!
And make me feel like I'm to blame
You pour your salt into my wounds!
I won't play your game!

Obsession (obsession) , rejection (rejection)
Your final breath is my possession
Obsession (obsession), rejection (rejection)
Your final breath is now my possession

Keep pouring salt into my wounds
Keep making me feel like I'm to blame
Keep pouring salt into my wounds
Keep making me feel like I'm to blame
Keep pouring salt into my wounds
I won't play your game!


Whoah-oh-oh-oh
Whoah-oh-oh-oh
Whoah-oh-oh-oh
Whoah-oh-oh-oh
Whoah-oh-oh-oh
So answer me, talk to me
So answer me, where's your sympathy?
You pour your salt into my wounds!
And make me feel like I'm to blame
You pour your salt into my wounds!
I won't play your game!

Obsession (obsession) , rejection (rejection)
Your final breath is my possession
Obsession (obsession), rejection (rejection)
Your final breath

Your final breath! (obsession)
I've told you before (rejection)
Your tears don't fall (obsession)
I've been here before (rejection)
They crash around me!2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You're worthless to me!

Have you nothing to say?
Can't you see what you're doing to me?
You keep breaking me down
But I won't let you get the better of me
I can't take anymore

Look at me
Is this what you want?
Look at me
Am I what you need?
One more word and I'm taking this all away
I won't take anymore

You can keep all your apologies
Those words are worthless to me
And I don't wanna hear that you're sorry
Your words mean nothing to me

Has this opened your eyes?
It was only a matter of time
I can tell by that look on your face (on your face)
That you know the tables have turned
No one's fault but your own
Look at me!
Tell me what you see
Look at me!
Am I what you need?
One more word and I'm taking this all away
I won't take anymore!

You can keep all your apologies
Those words are worthless to me
And I don't wanna hear that you're sorry
Your words mean nothing to me
No I don't want to hear that you're sorry
Your words are worthless to me

You can keep all your apologies
Listen to me!

You can keep all your apologies
Those words are worthless to me
And I don't wanna hear that you're sorry
Your words mean nothing to me
No, I don't want to hear that you're sorry
Your words mean nothing to me
And I don't want to hear that you're sorry
Your words are worthless to me!
They mean nothing!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Kill your enemies
My brothers dead around me
Wounds are hurting
Death is creeping for me
Smoke is blinding
Hearts are pounding
Chaos soon ignites
The call is made, it's one for all
Will I meet my maker?

Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
The only way out is to die

God has spoken through his conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
God has spoken through his conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
Charge!
Fuck this battlefield
The bullets tear around me
Bodies falling
Voices calling for me
Limbs are flying
Men are crying
Such a hurtful sight
The call is made, it's one for all
Take no prisoners

Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
The only way out is to die

God has spoken through his conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
God has spoken through his conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
Scream, aim, fire!
Scream, aim, fire!


Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
The only way out is to die

God has spoken through his conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
God has spoken through his conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher

Oh!
Scream, aim, fire!10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
