Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
(I watched you die, in your sleep)
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
(I was too young for you to lean on me)
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
(You never saw me, yeah yeah)
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid
Because of you (Ah ah, ah, ah)
Because of you, mmh, ooh...37EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

And all I remember is your back
Walkin' towards the airport, leavin' us all in your past
I traveled fifteen hundred miles to see you
Begged you to want me, but you didn’t want to

But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah
Piece by piece, he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old
And you know
He never walks away, he never asks for money
He takes care of me, he loves me
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

And all of your words fall flat
I made somethin' of myself and now you wanna come back
But your love, it isn’t free, it has to be earned
Back then I didn’t have anything you needed, so I was worthless

But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah
Piece by piece, he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old
And you know
He never walks away, he never asks for money
He takes care of me, 'cause he loves me
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece

Piece by piece, I fell far from the tree
I will never leave her like you left me
And she will never have to wonder her worth
Because unlike you, I’m gonna put her first
And you know
He'll never walk away, he'll never break her heart
He'll take care of things, he'll love her
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father should be great

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

Tonight, I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday
Alone to celebrate

But then, one day, everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree
I found what I was looking for
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all

'Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree


And then, one day, everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree, yeah
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing (Oh, yeah, yeah)
It just wasn't the same (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight (Oh, you're all I need)
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight (Underneath my tree)
You're all that I need (Underneath my tree, yeah)
Underneath the tree, tonight

There are moments that the words don't reach
There is suffering too terrible to name
You hold your child as tight as you can
Then push away the unimaginable
The moments when you're in so deep
Feels easier to just swim down
And so they move uptown
And learn to live with the unimaginable
I spend hours in the garden
I walk alone to the store
And it's quiet uptown
I never liked the quiet before
I take the children to church on Sunday
A sign of the cross at the door
And I pray
That never used to happen before

If you see him in the street walking by himself
Talking to himself, have pity
You would like it uptown, it's quiet uptown
He is working through the unimaginable
His hair has gone grey, he passes every day
They say he walks the length of the city
You knock me out, I fall apart
Can you imagine?
Look at where we are
Look at where we started
I know I don't deserve you
But hear me out, that would be enough
If I could spare his life
If I could trade his life for mine
He'd be standing here right now
And you would smile
And that would be enough
I don't pretend to know
The challenges we're facing
I know there's no replacing what we've lost
And you need time
But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
Just let me stay here by your side
And that would be enough

If you see him in the street, walking by her side
Talking by her side, have pity
Do you like it uptown? It's quiet uptown
He is trying to do the unimaginable
If you see him walking in the park, long after dark
Taking in the sights of the city
Look around, look around, look around
They are trying to do the unimaginable
There are moments that the words don't reach
There's a grace too powerful to name
We push away what we could never understand
We push away the unimaginable
They are standing in the garden
Standing there side by side
She takes his hand
It's quiet uptown
Forgiveness, can you imagine?
Forgiveness, can you imagine?

If you see him in the street, walking by her side
Talking by her side, have pity
Look around, look around
They are going through the unimaginable2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)

Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed (I would pray), I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away (I will)
And breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love (I gotta)
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging 'round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly (Learn how to fly)
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget of the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Breakaway

When you're lost in the moment
You can't see where you're goin'
I didn’t know who I could trust
So I put all my faith in us
Oh, you tore me to pieces
Turned my strength into weakness
I didn't want it all to fall apart
So I decided just to play the part

But honestly, I'd do it all again
Puttin' up with all the bullshit
It made me strong enough to do this

It used to bother me, thought I could never leave
After all that I've been through, nothin' left to prove
No, no, no, I don't think about you
Weighing down on me
I lost my sanity
And now that we are through, nothin' left to lose
No, no, no, I don't think about you

I feel freedom where I stand now
And I feel proud of who I am now
Yeah, I learned a lot along the way
I love the woman that I became
I was patient, but not anymore
It's back in my hands
And you swore I'd never do it
But it's your time to face the music

It used to bother me, thought I could never leave
After all that I've been through, nothin' left to prove
No, no, no, I don't think about you
Weighing down on me
I lost my own sanity
And now that we are through, nothin' left to lose
No, no, no, I don't think about you

It was hard to hold on
Days and nights I thought I'd never make it at all
Couldn't make it at all
Now I stand tall
Feeling like myself again, no worries at all
Breathe
No one can stop me from livin' this moment for me
I found my heartbeat
After all that I've been through
No, I don't think about you
It used to bother me, thought I could never leave
After all that I've been through, nothin' left to prove
No, no, no, I don't think about you
Weighing down on me
I found my sanity
And now that we are through, nothin' left to lose
No, no, no, I don't think about you

I don't think about you (no)

Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high
It never would've worked out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die

I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you, now I can't stop

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
It started with a perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
"Perfect" couldn't keep this love alive
You know that I love you so, I
Love you enough to let you go

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

I'm already gone, already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on, so I'm already gone

Ahh, already gone, already gone, already gone (Ooh, oh)
Ahh, already gone, already gone, already gone, yeah

Bet you won't like to hear that
Since we've been over, got that stress off my back
I'm livin' my life like a celebration
Changed up my vision like a revelation
You gave me fever love, but too much drama
And I ain't even worried 'bout it 'cause I'm too far gone now
Far gone now, oh yeah

Never bring me up
Always drag me down

To heal my soul, but you just caused more damage

Games around my head a thousand times?

Miss independent
Miss self-sufficient
Miss keep your distance
Miss unafraid
Miss out of my way
Miss don't let a man interfere, no
Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne
So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never ever feel rejected

To feel what's real

No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true

Miss guarded heart
Miss play it smart
Miss if you wanna use that line, you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't wanna end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love
So, by changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found inside, she felt a connection
She fell in love
What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door (Open the door)
Surprise, it's time
To feel what's real

No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye (Goodbye), old you (Old you)

When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid?
It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of "Why can't that be me?"
I'm so glad I finally see

What is this feelin' taking over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door
Surprise (Surprise), it's time
To feel (To feel) what's real

Feelin' like I've finally had enough
Livin' like an animal can be so rough

I've been waitin' so long for you to come my way

Meaning of life, life, life, life
You show me the meaning of life
Meaning of life, life, life, life
Show me the meaning of life
Show me the meaning of life, ooh
Show me the meaning of life7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long

You, where the hell did you come from?
You're a different, different kind of fun
And I'm so used to feeling numb
Now I've got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun

I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt it for a long time

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long (All night long)
I, I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would've had a doubt
If I'd have known where I'd be now

Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
Oh, I could do this for a long time

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long, all night long

Until tonight, I only dreamed about you
I can't believe I've ever breathed without you
Baby, you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time (One more time)
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long, all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long39EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

What you say?
(Girl, this my body)

You ain't know? Texas women do it bigger
(What? Say it ain't so)
In the south, it gets no realer, baby
Pot full of grits, I'm hotter than your mama's supper, boy
Better get with it
Better watch your mouth, I might burn you, boy
You go, uh, downtown, gonna work
Good Lord like dessert
If ya scared, go to church
Woo, woo, on alert
Hold on tight, little country boy
I ain't no girl, I'm a boss with orders
All I'm needin' is a baby to love me
Like a warm biscuit on a Sunday mornin'

I got what you want, I'm aimin' to please
I got what it takes, I sure got the means
I got what you want
Sugar, honey, iced tea
All eyes on me, oh, oh, baby
I'm a whole lotta woman
(From the way I walk and toss my hips)
I'm a whole lotta woman
(From the sound of my voice to the gloss on my lips)
I'm a whole lotta woman
(Anything I see, I want, I get)
I'm a strong, bad-ass chick with classic confidence, yeah

One time for the green
And rollin' like Tina
Lovin' hard ain't easy
Woo, woo, if ya mean it
Hold on tight, little country boy
I ain't no girl, I'm a boss with orders
All I'm needin' is a baby to love me
Like a warm biscuit on a Sunday mornin'

I got what you want, I'm aimin' to please
I got what it takes, I sure got the means
I got what you want
Sugar, honey, iced tea
All eyes on me, oh, oh, baby
I'm a whole lotta woman
(From the way I walk and toss my hips)
I said, I'm a whole lotta woman
(From the sound of my voice to the gloss on my lips)
I'm a whole lotta woman
(Anything I see, I want, I get)
I'm a strong, bad-ass chick with classic confidence, hey

Ain't no competition, babe
It's just can you keep up with me?
I can't do a thing about my wicked ways with gravity
Higher than the leaves, they fall from trees like D-O-Double G's
I reside in Tennessee, but Texas still flows deep in me

I'm a whole lotta woman
(From the way I walk and toss my hips)
Hey, I'm a whole lotta woman
(From the sound of my voice to the gloss on my lips)
I said, I'm a whole lotta woman
(Anything I see I want, I get)
I'm a strong, bad-ass chick with classic confidence, hey

Come on!
Wait, do it again5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong

Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright for once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside
'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside
Anymore
Anymore

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There's a wolf that preys on a world that strays so far from the Garden (Oh)
And just like your own, every heart you know seems cold and hardened (Oh)
You may not have the stage, but you still have a voice
You may not have the strength, but if you have a choice

I dare you to love
Oh, I dare you to love
Even if you're hurt and you can only see the worst
Even if you think it's not enough
Oh, I dare you to love

We're all full of hope, tryna stay afloat, tryna save one another
People let you drown 'cause they don't know how to stay above water
When they're too broken to know what they've put you through
Do the only thing that you'd want done to you

Oh, I dare you to love (Dare you to love)
Oh, I dare you to love (I dare you to love)
Even if you're hurt and you can only see the worst (Oh)
Even if you think it's not enough
Oh, I dare you to love
I dare you to love, oh

You may not have the stage, but you still have a voice
You may not have the strength, but if you have a choice

I dare you to love, even if you can't
No, I dare you to love
Oh, even if you're hurt and you can only see the worst (Only see the worst)
Even if you think it's not enough
Oh, I, I dare you

I dare you
Oh, I, I dare you to love2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Guess this means you're sorry
You're standin' at my door
Guess this means you take back
All you said before
Like how much you wanted
Anyone but me
Said you'd never come back
But here you are again

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you

Maybe I was stupid for tellin' you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong for tryna pick a fight
I know that I've got issues
But you're pretty messed up too
Either way I found out
I'm nothing without you

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you
Being with you is so dysfunctional
I really shouldn't miss you
But I can't let you go
Oh, yeah

'Cause we belong together now, yeah, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you, yeah
'Cause we belong together now, yeah (Together now)
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Ooh, yeah

I'm stumblin' through the darkness
There ain't no sign of a spark here
I'm used to feelin' that fire
You watered down that desire

I put my work in, day in, day out
Baby, I deserve it, don't let me down
You used to make me feel like a diamond
Now it don't even seem like you're tryin'
So give me one good reason I should need you

Oh, come turn this around
Oh, no, no, don't let us down
I need more heat from you, baby
Make me feel weak for you, babe
Oh, wanna feel alive
Oh, like my heart's in the wild
I need more heat from you, baby
Make me feel weak for you, babe
I'm slippin' out of your fingers
Keep coolin' down like November
I'm used to feelin' that fever
I wanna dive in you deeper

I put that work in, day in, day out
Baby, I deserve it, don't let me down, no
Give me one good reason I should need you

Oh, come turn this around
Oh, no, no, don't let us down
I need more heat from you, baby
Make me feel weak for you, babe
Oh, wanna feel alive
Oh, like my heart's in the wild
I need more heat from you, baby
Make me feel weak for you, babe

Better than that, better than that
You know I love you
Better than that, better than that
So come on, love me
Better than that, better than that
Oh, we can do much
Better than that, better than that
Oh, come turn this around
Oh, no, no, don't let us down
I need more heat from you, baby
Make me feel weak for you, babe
Oh, wanna feel alive
Oh, like my heart's in the wild
I need more heat from you, baby
Make me feel weak for you, babe

Better than that, better than that
Better than that, better than that
You know I love you, you know I need you
You know I love you, you know I need you, oh yeah
Better than that, better than that
Better than that, better than that
Better than that, better than that
Better than that, better than that
(So come on love) Better than that, better than that
Better than that (You I know I love you)
Better than that2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
