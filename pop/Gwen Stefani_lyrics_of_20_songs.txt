If I could escape, I would
But first of all, let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault, you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold

If I could escape (Escape)
And recreate a place that's my own world (Own world)
And I could be your favorite girl (Forever), perfectly together
And tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape)
If I could be sweet (Be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt (Whatsoever)
We can make it better
And tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?

You melt me down, I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground
So baby, times get a little crazy
I've been gettin' a little lazy
Waitin' on you to come save me
I can see that you're angry by the way that you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanna take you with me

If I could escape (Escape) and recreate a place that's my own world (Own world)
And I could be your favorite girl (Forever), perfectly together
And tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape)
If I could be sweet (Be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt (Whatsoever)

Never thought this would happen
Gotta let it sink in, you're gone
Don't know, know what I'm feeling
I must be dreaming, you're gone

Suitcase, band-aids
Pulling back out the driveway
You go, I'll stay
You can keep all the memories
I thought I was the best thing that ever happened to you
I thought you loved me the most

I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you

You thought there were no boundaries
But you just pushed me too far
I guess nobody taught you
Nobody taught you how to love

It's hard to remember how it felt before
Now I’ve found the love of my life
Passes, things get more comfortable
Everything is going right

And after all the obstacles
It's good to see you now with someone else
And it's such a miracle that you and me are still good friends
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool

And we used to think it was impossible
Now you call me by my new last name
Memories seem like so long ago
Time always kills the pain

Remember Harbor Boulevard?
The dreaming days where the mess was made
Look how all the kids have grown
We have changed, but we're still the same
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool
Yeah, I know we're cool
And I'll be happy for you
If you can be happy for me
Circles and triangles
And now we're hangin' out with your new girlfriend
So far from where we've been
I know we're cool
I know we're cool

C-cool, uh-uh, I know we're cool, uh-uh
I-I know we're cool
C-cool, yeah, I know we're cool

Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock

Like a cat in heat stuck in a moving car
A scary conversation, shut my eyes, can't find the brake
What if they say that you're a climber?
Naturally I'm worried if I do it alone
Who really cares? 'Cause it's your life
You never know, it could be great
Take a chance 'cause you might grow
Oh, oh-oh

Like an echo pedal, you're repeating yourself
You know it all by heart, why are you standing in one place?
(Uh-huh)
Born to blossom, bloom to perish
Your moment will run out 'cause of your sex chromosome
I know it's so messed up how our society all thinks (For sure)
Life is short, you're capable (Uh-huh)
Oh, oh-oh

Look at your watch now
You're still a super-hot female
You got your million-dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track!

What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting

I can't wait to go back and do Japan
Get me lots of brand new fans
Osaka, Tokyo

Damn, you've got some wicked style... go!

And I wanna make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?
Baby, if we're gonna do it, come on, do it right (Give you all of me)
Give me everything
Give you all of me6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

C'est pas possible cet amour
C'est incroyable
Tu me fais transpirer
C'est parfait

Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
The payback, the payback

Champagne kisses, hold me in your lap of luxury
I only wanna fly first-class desires, you're my limousine
So elegant, the way we ride
Our passion, it just multiplies
There's platinum lightning in the sky
Look, I'm livin' like a queen

This kind of love is getting expensive
We know how to live, baby
We're luxurious, like Egyptian cotton
We're so rich in love, we're rollin' in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear, baby
Diamond in my rough, is lookin' so sparkly
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
The payback, the payback
(Slim Thuga)

I made my stacks, now I finally get to lay back (Get to lay back)
I worked so hard, now I finally get the payback (Get the payback)
And blaze sex, ridin' in back of the Maybach (Chyea)
If it ain't 'dro, I say no, we don't play that (We don't play that)
I'm in my house like a Boss reclined
Puffin' on the sticky green, sippin' on me some wine (Sippin' on me some wine)
I made it out the hood and I'm feelin' real good about it (Huh)
Ridin' in the Benz, tryna pull the wood up out it (Chyea)

This kind of love is getting expensive
We know how to live, baby
We're luxurious, like Egyptian cotton

Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
The payback, the payback
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
The payback, the payback
Cha-ching, cha-ching
We're loaded and we're not gonna blow it
Cha-ching, cha-ching
We're hooked up with the love 'cause we grow it
Cha-ching, cha-ching
We got hydroponic love and we're smokin'
Cha-ching, cha-ching
We burn it, you and I, we are so lit

We're so rich in love, we're rollin in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear, baby
Diamond in my rough, is lookin' so sparkly

Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback

T'es si jolie

High on the hills with the lonely goatherd
Lay-od-lay-od-lay-he-hoo
He yodelled back with the girl and goatherd
Lay-od-lay-od-low

Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Yodellay, yodallay, yodel-low (Yeah)

This is the key that makes us wind up
When the beat comes on, the girls all line up
And the boys all look, but no, they can't touch
But the girls want to know why boys like us so much
They like way we dance, they like the way we work
They like the way that L.A.M.B. is going 'cross my shirt
They like the way my pants, it compliments my shape (She's crazy, right?)
They like the way we react every time we hear the...

Every time the bass bangs, realize it calls your name
Let the beat wind you up, and don't stop 'til your time is up
(Get in line now)
Wind it up
Wind it up (C'mon)
Wind it up
Yodelay, yodelay, yodal-low

You've got to let the beat get under your skin
You've got to open up and let it all in
But see, once it gets in, the popping begins
Then you find out why all the boys stare
See, they're trying to bite our style
Trying to study our approach
They like the way we do it, so original
I guess that they are slow, so they should leave the room
This beat is for the clubs and cars that go

Every time the bass bangs, realize it calls your name
Let the beat wind you up, and don't stop 'til your time is up
(Get in line now)

Wind it up (Whenever you're ready)
Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Yodelay, yodelay, yodal-low
(Uh-huh) this is your moment
(Uh-huh) come on girl, you know you own it
(Uh-huh) you know your key is still tick-tocking
(Hell yeah) but you know they're watching
Get it girl, get it, get it girl
Get it girl, get it, get it girl
To the front, to the side, to the back, but don't let him ride
Keep going girl, it's your night
Don't let him steal your light
I know he thinks you're fine and stuff
But does he know how to wind you up? (C'mon)

Wind it up

Wa-mono; there's me, there's you
(ホコ天)
In a pedestrian paradise
Where the catwalk got its claws (Meow)
A subculture, in a kaleidoscope of fashion
Prowl the streets of Harajuku
(いらっしゃいませ)

Super lovers, tell me where you got yours
(At the Super Lovers store)
Yohji Yamamoto, I'm hanging with the locals
Where the catwalk got its claws
All you fashion know-it-alls
With your underground malls
In the world of Harajuku
Putting on a show, when you dress up in your clothes
Wild hair color and cell phones
Your accessories are dead on

Harajuku Girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan
Harajuku Girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan
Harajuku Girls, I'm looking at you, girls
You're so original, girls
You got the look that makes you stand out
Harajuku Girls, I'm looking at you, girls
You mix and match it, girls
You dress so fly and just parade around
(Arigato)
I'm fascinated by the Japanese fashion scene
Just an American girl in the Tokyo streets
My boyfriend bought me a Hysteric Glamour shirt
They're hard to find in the states, got me feeling couture
(It's really cool)
What's that you got on? Is it Comme des Garçons?
Vivienne Westwood can't go wrong
Mixed up with second-hand clothes
(Let's not forget about John Galliano, no)
Flipped the landscape when Nigo made A Bathing Ape
I got expensive taste, oh well
I guess I better save up

Harajuku Girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan
Harajuku Girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan
Harajuku Girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan
Harajuku Girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan
Work it, express it, live it
Command your style
Create it, design it
Now let me see you work it
Create it, design it
Now let me see you work it

You bring style and color all around the world
You Harajuku Girls
You bring style and color all around the world
You Harajuku Girls

Your look is so distinctive, like DNA
Like nothing I've ever seen in the USA
Your underground culture, visual grammar
The language of your clothing is something to encounter
A Ping-Pong match between Eastern and Western
Did you see your inspiration in my latest collection?
Just wait till you get your little hands on L.A.M.B..
'Cause it's super kawaii
That means (Super cute in Japanese)
The streets of Harajuku are your catwalk
(Bishoujo, you're so vogue)
That's what you drop
(Cho saikou, Harajuku Girls)
And that's what you drop, that's what you drop
(Cho saikou, Harajuku Girls)
I'm your biggest fan
Gwen Stefani, you like me
Harajuku Girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan (Cho kawaii)
Harajuku Girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan

Style detached from content
A fatal attraction to cuteness
Style is style, fashion is fashion
