Look inside, look inside your tiny mind
Then look a bit harder
'Cause we're so uninspired, so sick and tired
Of all the hatred you harbour
So you say it's not okay to be gay
Well, I think you're just evil
You're just some racist who can't tie my laces
Your point of view is medieval

Fuck you (Fuck you), fuck you very, very much
'Cause we hate what you do
And we hate your whole crew
So please, don't stay in touch (Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Fuck you (Fuck you), fuck you very, very much
'Cause your words don't translate
And it's getting quite late
So please, don't stay in touch

Do you get, do you get a little kick out of being small minded?
You want to be like your father, it's approval you're after
Well, that's not how you find it
Do you, do you really enjoy living a life that's so hateful?
'Cause there's a hole where your soul should be
You're losing control of it
And it's really distasteful
Fuck you (Fuck you), fuck you very, very much
'Cause we hate what you do
And we hate your whole crew
So please, don't stay in touch (Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Fuck you (Fuck you), fuck you very, very much
'Cause your words don't translate
And it's getting quite late
So please, don't stay in touch

Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you

You say you think we need to go to war
Well, you're already in one
'Cause it's people like you that need to get slew
No one wants your opinion

Fuck you (Fuck you), fuck you very, very much
'Cause we hate what you do
And we hate your whole crew
So please, don't stay in touch (Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Fuck you (Fuck you), fuck you very, very much
'Cause your words don't translate
And it's getting quite late
So please, don't stay in touch

I suppose I should tell you
What this bitch is thinking
You'll find me in the studio
And not in the kitchen
I won't be bragging 'bout my cars
Or talking 'bout my chains
Don't need to shake my ass for you
'Cause I've got a brain
If I told you 'bout my sex life
You'd call me a slut
When boys be talking 'bout their bitches
No one's making a fuss
There's a glass ceiling to break, uh-huh
There's money to make
And now it's time to speed it up
'Cause I can't move at this pace

Sometimes, it's hard to find the words to say
I'll go ahead and say them anyway
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits
It's hard, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch

It's hard for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here
If you're not a size 6
Then you're not good-looking
Well, you better be rich
Or be real good at cooking
You should probably lose some weight
'Cause we can't see your bones
You should probably fix your face
Or you'll end up on your own
Don't you want to have somebody who objectifies you?
Have you thought about your butt; who's gonna tear it in two?
We've never had it so good, uh huh
We're out of the woods
And if you can't detect the sarcasm
You've misunderstood

Sometimes, it's hard to find the words to say
I'll go ahead and say them anyway
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits
It's hard, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch

It's hard for a bitch (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard for a bitch  (For a bitch)
For a bitch, it's hard
It's hard out here
A bitch, a bitch, a bitch
Bitch, bitch (bitch)

Inequality promises
That it's here to stay
Always trust the injustice

Been here before, so I'm prepared
Not gonna lie, though; I'm kinda scared
Lace up my gloves, I'm going in
Don't let my kids watch me when I get in the ring
I'll take the hits, roll with the punches
I'll get back up, it's not as if I've never done this
But, then again, the game is changing
Can't just come back, jump on the mic, and do the same thing
There goes the bell, I know that sound
I guess it's time for me to go another round
Oh, wish me luck, I'm gonna need it
I'll see you on the other side if I'm still breathing

RiRi isn't scared of Katy Perry's roaring
Queen B's going back to the drawing
Lorde smells blood, yeah, she's about to slay you
Kid ain't one to fuck with when she's only on her debut
We're all watching Gaga, LOL like haha
Dying for the art, so really, she's a martyr
And second best will never cut it for the divas
Give me that crown, bitch
I wanna be Sheezus

I'm ready for all the comparisons
I think it's dumb, and it's embarrassing
I'm switching off, no longer listening
I've had enough of persecution and conditioning
Maybe it's an instinct, we're only animal
Maybe it's healthy, maybe it's rational
It makes me angry, I'm serious
But, then again, I'm just about to get my period (Whoa!)
Periods, we all get periods
Every month, yo, that's what the theory is
It's human nature, another cycle
Be nice to me, I'll make you one of my disciples

I wanna be rich and I want lots of money
I don't care about clever, I don't care about funny
I want loads of clothes and fuckloads of diamonds
I heard people die while they're trying to find them
And I'll take my clothes off and it will be shameless
'Cause everyone knows that's how you get famous
I'll look at The Sun and I'll look in The Mirror
I'm on the right track, yeah, I'm on to a winner

I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
And when do you think it will all become clear?
'Cause I'm being taken over by the fear

Life's about film stars and less about mothers
It's all about fast cars and cussing each other
But it doesn't matter 'cause I'm packing plastic
And that's what makes my life so fucking fantastic
And I am a weapon of massive consumption
And it's not my fault, it's how I'm programmed to function
I'll look at The Sun and I'll look in The Mirror
I'm on the right track, yeah, we're on to a winner
I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
And when do you think it will all become clear?
'Cause I'm being taken over by the fear

Forget about guns and forget ammunition
'Cause I'm killing them all on my own little mission
Now I'm not a saint, but I'm not a sinner
And everything's cool as long as I'm getting thinner

I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
And when do you think it will all become clear?

Grab a few grams and a few grand
Wrapped in elastic in the blue bands
You reach for handouts with your two hands
Who's that? We’re the cool gang
No hippy but it’s so sticky
I’m a old school nigga, fam, I know Zippy
Steamboat Willie like the old Mickey
Steamboat Willie, she gets the whole dicky
'06 ratchet, had the old flicky
'017, now I got the ho's strippin;
Lowkey bredda on the low, sippin’
You can be the cool gang, but nigga, no slippin’

And it fuels my addictions
Hanging out in this whirlwind
If you cool my ambitions
I’m gonna cut you out

That’s why I can’t hang with the cool gang
Everyone’s a trigger bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Goodbye bad bones, I’ve got bigger plans
Gonna put myself in your hands
When I was young I was blameless
Playing with rude boys and trainers
I had a foot in the rave 'cause I was attracted to danger
I never got home for Neighbours, hey
When I grew up, nothing changed much
Anything went, I was famous
I would wake up next to strangers
Everyone knows what cocaine does
Numbing the pain when the shame comes, hey

And it fuels my addictions
Hanging out in this whirlwind
If you cool my ambitions
I’m gonna cut you out

That’s why I can’t hang with the cool gang
Everyone’s a trigger bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Goodbye bad bones, I’ve got bigger plans
Gonna put myself in your hands
That’s why I can’t hang with the cool gang
Everyone’s a trigger bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Goodbye bad bones, I’ve got bigger plans
Gonna put myself in your hands
Back in the day like at Yo-Yo
Then in L.A. at the Chateau
Someone would say, "Did you bang, no?"
I shake my head, I say, "No-no"
Maybe we did, I don’t think so, hey
I need to move on and grow some
Been in the Firehouse for too long
LDN's burning, so tan one
I’m gonna love you and leave some
I’m gonna go out while I’m still strong, hey

And it fuels my addictions
Hanging out in this whirlwind
If you cool my ambitions
I’m gonna cut you out

That’s why I can’t hang with the cool gang
Everyone’s a trigger bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Goodbye bad bones, I’ve got bigger plans
Gonna put myself in your hands

I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting tired and I need someone to rely on

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know
Somewhere only we know
Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need someone to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?

Oh, oh deary me
My little brother's in his bedroom smoking weed
I tell him he should get up 'cause it's nearly half past three
He can't be bothered 'cause he's high on THC
I ask him very nicely if he'd like a cup of tea
I can't even see him 'cause his room is so smoky
Don't understand how one can watch so much TV
My baby brother, Alfie, how I wish that you could see

I only say it 'cause I care
So please, can you stop pulling my hair?
Now, now there's no need to swear
Please don't despair, my dear mon frère

Ohh Alfie, get up, it's a brand new day
I just can't sit back and watch you waste your life away
You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid
Get off your lazy arse, Alfie, please use your brain
Surely there's some walls out there that you can go and spray
I'm feeling guilty for leading you astray
Now how the hell do you ever expect that you'll get laid
When all you do is stay and play on your computer games?
I only say it 'cause I care
So please, can you stop pulling my hair?
Now, now there's no need to swear
Please don't despair, my dear mon frère

Oh, little brother, please refrain from doing that
I'm tryna help you out so can you stop being a twat
It's time that you and I sat down and had a little chat
And look me in the eyes, take off that stupid fitted cap

Riding through the city on my bike all day
'Cause the filth took away my licence
It doesn't get me down and I feel okay
'Cause the sights that I'm seeing are priceless
Everything seems to look as it should
But I wonder what goes on behind doors
A fella looking dapper, and he's sitting with a slapper
Then I see it's a pimp and his crack whore

You might laugh, you might frown
Walkin' 'round London town

Sun is in the sky, oh why, oh why

There was a little old lady who was walking down the road
She was struggling with bags from Tesco
There were people from the city having lunch in the park
I believe that is called al fresco
When a kid came along to offer a hand
But before she had time to accept it
Hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead
'Cause he's got all her jewelry and wallet
You might laugh, you might frown
Walkin' round London town

Sometimes I find myself sitting back and reminiscing
Especially when I have to watch other people kissing
And I remember when you started calling me your missus
All the play fighting, all the flirtatious disses
I'd tell you sad stories about my childhood
I don't know why I trusted you, but I knew that I could
We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
I was just so happy in your boxers and your t-shirt

Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of you and me
And it seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you have the same dreams too

The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame, but it's so true
I know it's not right, but it seems unfair
That the things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if only for one weekend
So come on, tell me
Is this the end?
Drinking tea in bed, watching DVD's
When I discovered all your dirty grotty magazines
You take me out shopping and all we'd buy is trainers
As if we ever needed anything to entertain us
The first time that you introduced me to your friends
And you could tell I was nervous, so you held my hand
When I was feeling down, you made that face you do
There's no one in the world who could replace you

Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of me and you
And it seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you feel the same way too

The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame, but it's so true
I know it's not right, but it seems unfair
That the things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if only for one weekend

When she was 22, the future looked bright
But she's nearly 30 now and she's out every night
I see that look in her face, she's got that look in her eye
She's thinking, "How did I get here?" and wondering why

It's sad, but it's true how society says her life is already over
There's nothing to do and there's nothing to say
Until the man of her dreams comes along
Picks her up and puts her over his shoulder
It seems so unlikely in this day and age

She's got an alright job, but it's not a career
Wherever she thinks about it, it brings her to tears
'Cause all she wants is a boyfriend; she gets one-night stands
She's thinking, "How did I get here? I'm doing all that I can"

You saying you're going but you don't say how long for
You say it's work, but I'm not sure
You say you love me, then you walk right out the door
I'm left here wanting more
Of course there's lots of things I could be getting on with
I'm never short of things to do

Please, you know I rate Queens
Yo, cah that's in my jeans
I don't want grief, don't want drama
I just went out for a little Chinese
Had Chinese then couldn't leave
I lost my phone and my cards and keys
Came, came home four o'clock
Walk back like I'm, walk back like I'm chief

Do me right, you're lying
It's in your eyes, don't try it
No, you can't hide, have you lost your mind?
Did I cross your mind?
It's your life, I said I'd never
Let you waste my time
I said you'd never
Hear me say that twice
You crossed that line
You crossed that line

You know what you're doing
I won't listen to another excuse
This time you blew it
The people you used are jumping through hoops
I won't let you do it
You can't seduce me, now who looks foolish?
Sorry, but I know your type
I won't be undermined
I can take this down to the wire
Soon see if I fight fire with fire
Dig that grave
You're such a bad liar
Stakes gettin' higher and higher and higher and higher

Higher, higher, higher (high-high-higher)
Higher, higher, higher (high-higher)
Higher, higher, higher (high-high-higher)
High-higher (high-higher)

You'll be fine, stop crying
Dry your eyes, stop fighting
Rest that mind, give yourself some time
You might like what you find
It's your life, and I said I'd never
Let you ruin mine
I said I'd never, ever
Pay the price
You crossed the line
You crossed the line

Why did you do it? (Oh, yeah)
Why would you choose to use and abuse me?
This close to ruin (oh, yeah)
Why just stand by?
Don't you dare roll your eyes
Why put me through it?
Enough with the lies
I know what the truth is
Sorry, but I know your type
I won't be undermined
I can take this down to the wire
Soon see if I fight fire with fire
Dig that grave
You're such a bad liar
Stakes gettin' higher and higher and higher and higher

Higher, higher, higher (high-high-high-higher)
Higher, higher, higher (high-high-higher)
Higher, higher, higher (high-high-high-higher)
Higher, higher, higher (high-high-higher)9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Do you remember way back when, at my old flat
We'd stay in bed all day having sex and smoking fags
So much has happened since then
I wish we could go back
I'd do things differently, but I went off the tracks

So cliché for me to say, I never meant to break your heart
I'm to blame for all your pain
I never could have played that part

I had to do it, baby
We were both depressed
Towards the end we were not even having sex
I felt like I was only good for writing the cheques
I like a drink but that does not make me a wreck

So cliché for me to say, I never meant to break your heart
I'm to blame for all your pain
I never could have played that part
So cliché for me to say, I never meant to break your heart
I'm to blame for all your pain
I never could have played that part
One year in you gave me, a set of keys
Two years and you bended down on one knee
Three years and we're living out in the country
Four years and you've given me my beautiful babies
But it was all too much for me
Now I'm exactly where I didn't want to be
I'm just like my mummy and daddy

I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
I guess the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
(Apple doesn't fall too far from the tree
Apple doesn't fall too far from the tree
Apple doesn't fall too far from the tree
Apple doesn't fall too far from the tree
Apple doesn't fall too far from the tree)3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I caught some feelings
Now I sense a change
Something beautiful has slipped away
I let you in and
Then you disappeared
Like the dying of another day

I was never planning on
Any of this chaos
I wasn't being difficult
But you still betrayed us

Now I'm stuck in a rut, kicking stones
Looking at my phone all night
Maybe I've lost my mind
When I couldn't breathe, couldn't sleep
And you say it served me right
Maybe I've lost my mind

You're on the ceiling
I'm down here on the floor
Keeps me coming back
Keeps me begging for more
I knew there'd be other girls
And I liked the danger
Once or twice I've seen your soul
We weren't always strangers

Stuck in a rut, kicking stones
Looking at my phone all night
Maybe I've lost my mind
When I couldn't breathe, couldn't sleep
And you say it served me right
Maybe I've lost my mind

You wouldn't give me closure
Let me get off the ride
And now I'm getting closer
To the other side

Now I'm stuck in a rut, kicking stones
Looking at my phone all night
Maybe I've lost my mind
When I couldn't breathe, couldn't sleep
And you say it served me right
Maybe I've lost my mind
Stuck in a rut, kicking stones
Looking at my phone all night
Maybe I've lost my mind
Stuck in a rut, kicking stones
Looking at my phone all night
Maybe I've lost my mind5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Good lover, good lover
Feels good like a long hot summer
Late comer, he's a late comer
My man is a bad motherfucker
He can bring it, bring it all day long
All other men, them been wrong
Nobody will get to see
'Cause he's gonna spend his life with me

You can't have him
No way, he's taken ladies; I've got me his babies
Look at my ring
He's going nowhere 'til this fat lady sings

And when I see his face
I feel like I could win the race
And when he calls, when he calls my name
I know we're in the long game
What would I leave him for?
I couldn't ask for any more
I wouldn't send, I wouldn't send him back
He won me, game, set, and match
(Late comer, he's a late comer)
My lover, my lover
Shoots and scores like he's Maradona
Undercover, under the covers
My man is a bad motherfucker
Anybody, anyone could see
I'd have caught him eventually
Me and him have a thing that's rare
Other girls can look elsewhere

You can't have him
No way, he's taken ladies; I've got me his babies
Look at my ring
He's going nowhere 'til this fat lady sings

And when I see his face
I feel like I could win the race
And when he calls, when he calls my name
I know we're in the long game
What would I leave him for?
I couldn't ask for any more
I wouldn't send, I wouldn't send him back
He won me, game, set, and match
You can look, girl, but you can't touch
Don't know why I love him so much
Can't put this thing into words
My love for him's absurd
You can look, girl, but you can't touch
Don't know why I love him so much
Can't put this thing into words
My love for him's absurd

And when I see his face
I feel like I could win the race
And when he calls, when he calls my name
I know we're in the long game
What would I leave him for?
I couldn't ask for any more
I wouldn't send, I wouldn't send him back
He won me, game, set, and match
And when I see his face
I feel like I could win the race
And when he calls, when he calls my name
I know we're in the long game
What would I leave him for?
I couldn't ask for any more
I wouldn't send, I wouldn't send him back
He won me, game, set, and match

Somebody remind me where I am: Miami or Timbuktu?
Did I ever tell you my uncle's monkey ran away from the zoo?
Would you tell me what this all means?
What happens if I go through that door?
'Cause I'm looking up at the ceiling, but it's turning into the floor

Ooo, when I'm bored, I kind of drift away
I'm not sure, quite, why we work all day
I've been thinking and I've got this plan
Let's go right now

Come meet me in the sky, I'll be waitin' for you
And we can't hear what they say
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon
Sing, sing, along, along any song you want to
Now, we're so high it can't rain
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon

I don't like dropping names, but Kurt Cobain is all in my face
How the hell am I gonna tell him Elvis already took first base?
And then, out of the blue, this cruise is losing altitude
All we need is a little more elevation
Take me back to where I can breathe
Ooo, when I'm bored, I kind of drift away
I'm not sure, quite, why we work all day
I've been thinking and I've got this plan
Let's go right now

Come meet me in the sky, I'll be waitin' for you
And we can't hear what they say
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon
Sing, sing, along, along any song you want to
Now, we're so high it can't rain
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon

Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it now
Gimme, gi-gimme, gimme some
Sailing, s-sailing through the clouds
Trippin', tri-tri-tri-trippin' out
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it now
Gimme, gi-gimme, gimme some
Sailing, s-sailing through the clouds
Trippin', tri-tri-tri-trippin' out

Come meet me in the sky, I'll be waitin' for you
And we can't hear what they say
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon
Sing, sing, along, along any song you want to
Now, we're so high it can't rain
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon
Come meet me in the s-
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon
Come meet me in the s-
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

What's going on in the magazines?
It's the same damn thing in every one
I don't give a fuck about the Delevigne, that Rita girl, about Jourdan Dunn
I don't wanna know about your perfect life, your perfect wife and it makes me sick
I don't give a fuck about your instagram, about your lovely house or your ugly kids

I'm not your friend and I can't pretend (I ain't being funny, funny)
Let's be clear, I'm here, I'm here to make money, money, money
If I force a smile and can make it worthwhile (Don't touch me honey, honey)
Let's be clear, I'm here, I'm here to make money, money, money

Insincere, insincerely yours tonight
(Let's be clear, I'm here, I'm here to make money, money, money)
We're all here, we're all here cause the price is right
(Let's be clear, I'm here, I'm here to make money, money, money)

Whatever happened to the real DJs?
'Cause the chick you've paid can't mix for shit
She's looking good with her headphones on
With her Beats by Dre, she's so legit
I see pictures of her all the time on the Mail Online, she's everywhere
Does anybody know what she does? Do you know her name?
Do you really care?
I'm not your friend and I can't pretend (I ain't being funny, funny)
Let's be clear, I'm here, I'm here to make money, money, money

We're all here, we're all here cause the price is right
(Let's be clear, I'm here, I'm here to make money, money, money)

I've never been one to moan that you're doing in my head now (Doing in my head, doing in my head, doing in my head)
Won't somebody take me home?
I'm ready for my bed now
(Ready for my bed, ready for my bed, ready for my bed)

Insincere, insincerely yours tonight
