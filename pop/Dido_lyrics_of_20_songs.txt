My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply
That I might not last the day
And then you call me
And it's not so bad, it's not so bad

And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life
Push the door, I'm home at last
And I'm soaking through and through
Then you handed me a towel
And all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now
I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me

And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life
And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life33EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I know you think that
I shouldn't still love you
Or tell you that
But if I didn't say it
Well, I'd still have felt it
Where's the sense in that?
I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

But I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too
Much mess and destruction
To come back again
And I caused nothing but trouble
I understand if you
Can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of "it's over"
Then I'm sure that that makes sense
But I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

And when we meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was there
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Don’t wrap it up in gold
Don’t hide it behind the sun
Just give it to me as it is
And let it stand
Don’t fly it like a kite
Between the clouds
It needs no excuse
Just bring it down
Let eyes that are in pain look upon it
In all its glory

Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass

For every voice that is lifted
In reverence and pain
Show us now
And let love not be chained
We should feel what we can stand
And let us be alive
So we know
That we’ve done all we can
Let hearts that are frozen get to see it
In all its glory
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass

And let all that is lost be forgotten
And it will pass
So let all that is lost be forgotten
Let us move on

Like the waters in the open sea
When tribulations come all we can say is hopefully
And yesterday you could probably say there's no hope for me
But today I'm overly dedicated, I'm 'posed to be
A testimony for broken hearts in the city
You either crash landing or planning on flying with me
Misery loves standing behind its company, well
Vividly I can see that your feelings would like to dwell
On our past encounters, reaching over the counter
Told me that it's a appealing to pop a pill, that's a downer
I heard emotions burn deep
I heard when you fall out of love the drop is steep
I heard when you see a thug, that's what you try be
Got these burdens under my wings, but I'm still free
Cause I can make the decision to let it all go away
Before I ever run astray I'll look you in the eye and say
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I haven't ever really found a place that I call home
I never stick around quite long enough to make it
I apologize that once again I'm not in love
But it's not as if I mind that your heart ain't exactly breaking
It's just a thought, only a thought

But if my life is for rent
And I don't learn to buy
Well I deserve nothing more than I get
'Cause nothing I have is truly mine

I've always thought that I would love to live by the sea
To travel the world alone and live more simply
I have no idea what's happened to that dream
'Cause there's really nothing left here to stop me
It's just a thought, only a thought

If my life is for rent
And I don't learn to buy
Well I deserve nothing more than I get
'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
If my life is for rent
And I don't learn to buy
Well I deserve nothing more than I get
'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
While my heart is a shield and I won't let it down
While I am so afraid to fail so I won't even try
Well, how can I say I'm alive?

If my life is for rent
And I don't learn to buy
Well I deserve nothing more than I get
'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
If my life is for rent
And I don't learn to buy
Well I deserve nothing more than I get
'Cause nothing I have is truly mine

You don't, you don't get under my skin no more
No, it's gone, it's gone

I found a way to let you go

Got your picture covering up the cracks on the wall
But the lines won't fade
Didn't think that I would be missing you at all
Maybe that was my mistake

I wanna wake up with your weight by my side
And I wanna think that you look good as you rise
And I wanna turn to you, turn around by your side
And I wanna think, but not to say

Let me face the sound and fury
Let me face hurricanes

And I wanna see you as you walk through the door
And time will make us, some ways less and some ways more
And I wanna talk of nothing as the world passes by

I didn't hear you leave
I wonder how am I still here
And I don't want to move a thing
It might change my memory

Oh, I am what I am

With one light on in one room
I know you're up when I get home
With one small step upon the stair
I know your look when I get there

If you were a king up there on your throne
Would you be wise enough to let me go?
For this queen you think you own

Wants to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go

The unread book and painful look
The TV's on, the sound is down
One long pause, then you begin
Oh, look what the cat's brought in

If you were a king up there on your throne
Would you be wise enough to let me go?
For this queen you think you own
Wants to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go, let me leave

For the crown you've placed upon my head feels too heavy now
And I don't know what to say to you but I'll smile anyhow
And all the time I'm thinking, thinking

I want to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go

I want to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go, let me leave

I know you thought I'd never be
Really much of anything
While you were telling me
I turned against the wind
And when my eyes started to burn
And you turned your back on me

Well, you see, I slipped away
Now time to me
’Cause I've done a hundred things
You've only dreamed

So don’t come crying to me
Don't come trying again
No matter how I feel, don't call us friends
'Cause I don't remember anymore how we used to be
No, I don't remember anymore how I used to feel
Don't call us friends

And you waited all alone
For your luck to come along
You assumed that things they'd go your way
It would all just carry on
Well, you see it slipped away

You've only dreamed

So don’t come crying to me

Rolling seas, endless roads heading into the sun
Big skies, bigger dreams, enough for everyone
I was brave, free of love, I wanted to travel alone
We were born in the light, I'm sorry I remembered it wrong

I'm sorry that I broke you down
I'm sorry that I thought it through
I'm sorry that I looked and ran
I couldn't keep up good enough

You were there when I needed you
A hand without a word
Stood at my back when I wanted you
Turned away when it hurt
You were there when I called for you
And then I walked away
I've run so far, but you're still on my mind
You're still on my mind

The sun began to burn too bright
I saw myself in the light
I opened the door and lost the dream
And couldn't go back inside
I took a road that led nowhere
I didn't know that then
But I made my choice
Now I've gone too far to come back here again
I'm sorry that I let you down
I'm sorry that I lost the way
I'm sorry that I died and then came alive
I couldn't keep up

You were there when I needed you
A hand without a word
Stood at my back when I wanted you
Turned away when it hurt
You were there when I called for you
And then I walked away
Well, I've run so far, you're still on my mind
You're still on my mind
You were there when I needed you
A hand without a word
Stood at my back when I wanted you
Turned away when it hurt
You were there when I called for you

Like a ghost don't need a key
Your best friend I've come to be
Please don't think of getting up for me

So close the blinds and shut the door
You won't need other friends anymore

Oh, don't leave home

And if you're cold, I'll keep you warm
If you're low, just hold on

Take it by your silence
That I'm free to walk out the door
By the look in your eyes I can tell
You don't think I'll be back for more

Try to think of the world
Where you could stay and these safe hands could go
Take your heart above the water
Wherever I choose to go

No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love

Even when you don't see me
And even when you don't hear
I'll be flying low below the sun
And you'll feel it all out here

No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No love without freedom
No freedom without love

Holding you in my hand
And seeing as you'd see

Two weeks away, feels like the whole world should have changed
But I'm home now and things still look the same
I think I'll leave it till tomorrow to unpack
Try to forget for one more night that I'm back in my flat

On the road where the cars never stop
Going through the night
To a life where I can't watch the sunset
I don't have time, I don't have time

I've still got sand in my shoes
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on, forget you
But why would I want to?
I know we said goodbye
Anything else would've been confused
But I wanna see you again

Tomorrow's back to work and down to sanity
Should run a bath and then clear up the mess I made before I left here
Try to remind myself that I was happy here before
I knew that I could get on a plane and fly away
From the road where the cars never stop
Going through the night
To a life where I can watch the sunset
And take my time, take all our time

I've still got sand in my shoes
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on, forget you
But why would I want to?
I know we said goodbye
Anything else would've been confused
But I wanna see you again
I wanna see you again
I wanna see you again

Two weeks away, all it takes
To change and turn me around I've fallen
I walked away and never said
That I wanted to see you again

I've still got sand in my shoes
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on, forget you
But why would I want to?
I know we said goodbye
Anything else would've been confused
But I wanna see you again
I've still got sand in my shoes
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on, forget you
But why would I want to?
I know we said goodbye

The sun is hanging low across the street
As we're fighting, loving, talking in the heat
We’re all walking home burnt and late
Every day we'll meet, every day we'll meet
And do the same

I can sing you a song, take you home
But I can’t seem to find my own
I can sing you a song, take you home
But I can't seem to find my way home

We could dance all night and sleep all day
Kiss and love and just walk away
Took pride in all the rules we'd disobey
Moved so slow, we didn't see a change

I can sing you a song, take you home
But I can't seem to find my own
I can sing you a song, take you home
But I can't seem to find my way home

I can hear the music
Just a few notes from a passing car
And it can take me
With heart opening speed
To somewhere not here
I'm hell stuck still by a side of something
Nothing much to see, but enough to catch me

And send me absolutely elsewhere
And take me absolutely right here

You don’t need a god to pray I'm here
You don't need a god to stay out here
You don’t need a thing
While we have right here

It can be one word
Or the smallest thing that only I see
It's like lightning
And it changed the way I feel

And sends me absolutely elsewhere
And holds me absolutely right here
You don't need a god to pray I'm here
You don't need a god to stay out here
You don't need a thing
While we have right here
You don't need a god to pray I'm here
You don’t need a god to stay out here
You don’t need a thing
While we have right here
Right here

She found the records lying underneath the bed
All the songs she used to sing
All the songs she used to play
All those words, those melodies
And the promise of some kind of love
And the promise of some kind of love

When we lose what we love
Don't think anything will ever taste the same
When we lose what we love
Don't think anything will ever feel as good again

Destroy only enough that enough still remains of

Danny is lonely cause Mary's in India now
She said she'd call, but that was three weeks ago
She left all her things, well, her books and her letters from him
As the sun rises on Mary, it sets on him

And just dance and just drink
And just see the things I'll probably never get a chance to see

Danny's not eating, he's drinking and sleeping in
I saw him last night at a party, he's definitely thin
He says he's happy, he looked pretty good but I think
That as the sun rises on Mary, it sets on him

And just dance and just drink
And just see the things I'll probably never get a chance to see

Danny came over last night and I cooked for him
We talked about you, Mary, and how much we loved you still
He told me he's packed up your books and your letters and things
As the sun sets on Mary, it's rising on him
And we danced and we drank
And I've seen some things you probably never got a chance to see

Don't worry, Mary, cause I'm taking care of Danny

Speeches won't be made today, clocks will carry on
Flowers won't be left in parks, work will still be done
People won't be dressed in black, babies will be born
No flags will fly, the sun will rise but we will know that you are gone

You who loved to love
And believed we can never give enough

It wakes me every single night thinking through the day
Did you stop at any time, have doubts at any stage?
Or were you calm or were you numb, or happy just to get it done?
I've lived my life without regret until today

And you who loved to love
And believed we can never give enough

I didn't get to say goodbye the day before the day
Was trying to get to work on time that's why I turned away
And missed the most important thing you ever tried to say
I've lived my life without regret until today
And you who love to love
And believed we can never give enough
And you who hoped that underneath
We all felt the same

When you're stoned, baby, and I am drunk
And we make love, it seems a little desolate
It's hard sometimes not to look away
And think what's the point when I'm having to hold this fire down
I think I'll explode if I can't feel this free now

If you won't let me fall for you
Then you won't see the best that I would love to do for you
Instead, you will be missing me when I go
Cause I'm bored of hanging out in your cold

When I feel loved, baby, I join the road
And the world moves with me
When I feel lost I just slip away
Silently, quietly take my things and go
And think what's the point, think where's the hope we're coming home

Cause if you won't let me fall for you
Then you won't see the best that I would love to do for you
Instead, you will be missing me when I go
Cause I'm bored of hanging out in your cold
And if you find one day
Find some freedom and relief
With this freedom maybe
Maybe you will find some peace
And with this peace baby
I hope it brings you back to me
Bring you home, take me home

Cause if you won't let me fall for you
Then you won't see the best that I would love to do for you
Instead, you will be missing me when I go
Cause I'm bored of hanging out in your cold
