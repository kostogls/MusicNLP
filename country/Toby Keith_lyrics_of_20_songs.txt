American girls and American guys
We’ll always stand up and salute, we’ll always recognize
When we see Old Glory flying there’s a lot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

My daddy served in the army where he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard 'til the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free

Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see it clearly through our big black eye
Man, we lit up your world like the Fourth of July

Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Oh, brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue
Oh, justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
And you’ll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A
`Cause we`ll put a boot in your ass, it`s the American way

Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

Oh, oh
Of the red, white and blue
Oh, oh
Of my red, white, and blue5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Don't let the old man in, I wanna leave this alone
Can't leave it up to him, he's knocking on my door
And I knew all of my life, that someday it would end
Get up and go outside, don't let the old man in

Many moons I have lived
My body's weathered and worn
Ask yourself how would you be
If you didn't know the day you were born

Try to love on your wife
And stay close to your friends
Toast each sundown with wine
Don't let the old man in

Many moons I have lived
My body's weathered and worn
Ask yourself how would you be
If you didn't know the day you were born

When he rides up on his horse
And you feel that cold bitter wind
Look out your window and smile
Don't let the old man in
Look out your window and smile
Don't let the old man inEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I bet you have never heard ol' Marshal Dillon say
"Miss Kitty, have you ever thought of running away
Settling down, would you marry me
If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please?"
She'd have said yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot, his heart wasn't in it
He just stole a kiss as he rode away
He never hung his hat up
At Kitty's place

I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh, I should've been a cowboy

I might've had a sidekick with a funny name
Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James
Ending up on the brink of danger
Riding shotgun for the Texas Rangers
Go west, young man, haven't you been told
California's full of whiskey, women and gold
Sleeping out all night beneath the desert stars
With a dream in my eye, and a prayer in my heart
I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh, I should have been a cowboy

I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
I'd be wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girls' hearts

Well a man come on the 6 o’clock news
Said somebody’s been shot, somebody’s been abused
Somebody blew up a building
Somebody stole a car
Somebody got away
Somebody didn’t get too far yeah
They didn’t get too far

Grand pappy told my pappy, back in my day, son
A man had to answer for the wicked that he done
Take all the rope in Texas
Find a tall oak tree, round up all of them bad boys
Hang them high in the street for all the people to see that

Justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we’ll sing a victory tune
We’ll all meet back at the local saloon
We’ll raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horses

We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds
We’ve got too much corruption, too much crime in the streets
It’s time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground
Send them all to their maker and he’ll settle them down
You can bet he’ll set them down ’cause
Justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we’ll sing a victory tune
We’ll all meet back at the local saloon
We’ll raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horses
Justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we’ll sing a victory tune
We’ll all meet back at the local saloon

Hey, one, two, three

Now, red Solo cup is the best receptacle
For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals
And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinking from glass
Hey, red Solo cup is cheap and disposable
And in 14 years, they are decomposable
And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable
Freddy Mac can kiss my ass
Whoo!

Red Solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
I love you, red Solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party

Now, I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
'Cause when beer runs down in front of my pack
Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky
But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admiring at how sharply my first name is written
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hitting
On them to help me get lucky
Red Solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
I love you, red Solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party

Now, I've seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow
But only you, red, will do for this fellow
'Cause you are the Abbott to my Costello
And you are the Fruit to my Loom (Here we go now)
Red Solo cup, you're more than just plastic
You're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic
And believe me that I am not the least bit sarcastic
When I look at you and say

Red Solo cup, you're not just a cup
(No! No! No! God, no! )
You're my-you're my (Friend?) friend
(Friend, friend, friend,life-long)
Thank you for being my friend
Red Solo cup
(That's what I am talking about)
I fill you up
Let's have a party

We got winners, we got losers
Chain smokers and boozers
And we got yuppies, we got bikers
We got thirsty hitchhikers
And the girls next door dress up like movie stars

Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar

We got cowboys, we got truckers
Broken-hearted fools and suckers
And we got hustlers, we got fighters
Early birds and all-nighters
And the veterans talk about their battle scars

Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar

I love this bar
It's my kind of place
Just walkin' through the front door
Puts a big smile on my face
It ain't too far, come as you are
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar

I've seen short skirts, we got high-techs
Blue-collar boys and rednecks
And we got lovers, lots of lookers
And I've even seen dancing girls and hookers
And we like to drink our beer from a mason jar

Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
Yes I do

2:34 - 2:51

I like my truck (I like my truck)
I like my girlfriend (I like my girlfriend)
I like to take her out to dinner
I like a movie now and then

But I love this bar
It's my kind of place
Just trollin' around the dance floor
Puts a big smile on my face
No cover charge, come as you are
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
Hmm, hmm, hmm I just love this 'ol bar

We got divorcees and a big bouncer man
An old jukebox and a real bad band
We got waitresses and we got barflies
A dumb-ass and a wise-guy
If you get too drunk just sleep out in your car

Reason number 672 why

Beer-thirty's over
Got to take it on home

Happy birthday America
It's the Fourth of July
I get to wake up in your freedom
But sometimes I wonder why
Seems like everybody's pissin'
On the red, white and blue
Happy birthday America
Whatever's left of you

You were the darlin' when you saved the world
WW I and II
France would just be part of Germany now
If it hadn't been for you

Now your children wanna turn you in
To something other than yourself
They burn your flag in their city streets
More than anybody else

Happy birthday America
It's the Fourth of July
I get to wake up in your freedom
But sometimes I wonder why
Seems like everybody's pissin'
On the red, white and blue
Happy birthday America
Whatever's left of you
Who they gonna count on
When you're not there to take their call?
Will the world keep right on spinnin'
Without the greatest of them all?
Without the helping hand of God
Your days are numbered, my old friend
We're sure gonna miss you, girl
You were the best that's ever been
Happy birthday America

All the broken-down cities
By the left's design
And the right can't seem to get it right
Most of the time
Every time I go to town and vote
I just come home with the blues
The lesser of two evils
All we ever get to choose

Happy birthday America
It's the Fourth of July
I'll get to wake up in your freedom
But sometimes I wonder why
Seems like everybody's pissin'
On the red, white and blue
Happy birthday America
Whatever's left of you

My old man's that old man, spent his life livin' off the land
Dirty hands and a clean soul
It breaks his heart seein' foreign cars filled with fuel that isn't ours
And wearin' cotton we didn't grow

He's got the red, white, blue flyin' high on the farm
Semper Fi tattooed on his left arm
Spend a little more at the store for a tag
In the back that says U-S-A
He won't buy nothin' that he can't fix
With WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just
Made in America

He loves his wife, but she's that wife that decorates on the 4th of July
But says, "Every day's Independence Day"
She's golden rule, teaches school, some folks say it isn't cool
But she says the Pledge of Allegiance anyway

He's got the red, white, blue flyin' high on the farm
Semper Fi tattooed on his left arm
Spend a little more in the store for a tag
In the back that says U-S-A
He won't buy nothin' that he can't fix
With WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just
Made in America
Born in the heartland, raised up a family
Of King James and Uncle Sam

He's got the red, white, blue flyin' high on the farm
Semper Fi tattooed on his left arm
Spend a little more in the store for a tag
In the back that says U-S-A
Won't buy nothin' that he can't fix
With WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just
Made in America

She said, "I've seen you in here before."
I said, "I've been here a time or two."
She said, "Hello, my name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face"
I said, "Girls,"

I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big bad biker man
I heard David yell across the room
"Hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand?"
I said, "Dave,"
I ain't as good as I once was
My, how the years have flown
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
But if you wanna fight tonight
Guess those boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says, "You can't do this boy"
But my pride says, "Oh, yes you can"

I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feeling bullet proof
So don't double dog dare me now
Cause I'd have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
May not be good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Winter getting colder, summer getting warmer
Tidal wave coming 'cross the Mexican border
Why buy a gallon, it's cheaper by the barrel

Momma gets her rocks off watching' Desperate Housewives
Daddy works his ass off paying' for the good life
Kids on the YouTube learning how to be cool
Living in a cruel world, pays to be a mean girl

She gained five pounds and lost her crown
Quick fix plastic surgical antidote
Got herself a record deal, can't even sing a note

Plasma getting bigger, Jesus getting smaller
Spill a cup of coffee, make a million dollars
Customs caught a thug with an aerosol can
If the shoe don't fit, fits gonna hit the shan

I'm just trying to be a father
Raise a daughter and a son
Be a lover to their mother
Everything to everyone
Up and at them bright and early
I'm all business in my suit
Yeah, I'm dressed for success
From my head down to my boots

I don't do it for money there's still bills that I can't pay
I don't do it for the glory, I just do it anyway
Providing for our future's my responsibility
Yeah I'm real good under pressure, being all that I can be
And I can't call in sick on Mondays
When the weekends been to strong
I just work straight through the holidays
And sometimes all night long

You can bet that I stand ready when the wolf growls at the door
Hey, I'm solid, hey I'm steady, hey I'm true down to the core
And I will always do my duty, no matter what the price
I've counted up the cost, I know the sacrifice
Oh, and I don't want to die for you
But if dying's asked of me
I'll bear that cross with honor
Cause freedom don't come free
I'm an American soldier, an American
Beside my brothers and my sisters I will proudly take a stand
When liberty's in jeopardy I will always do what's right
I'm out here on the front lines, so sleep in peace tonight

Ahh Yeah
What's That Smell?

Wanda is a woman she works down the hall
Shows up on time, she's like balls to the wall
She went out to lunch with her High School Friends
'Bout three hours later she came rollin' back in
Well, the boss man really jumped her
Son he wasn't joking
Everybody in the office knew Wanda had been smokin'

That old Wacky Tobaccy
When you feel it creeping up on you
That old Wacky Tobaccy
Kick back and let it do what it do

Know you can two tote her, you can one hit him
Puff it in a pipe and you can twist it in a stem
You can bake it in some brownies, smoke it through a Bong
Roll up a great big fat one like ol' Cheech and Chong
Burn it through a hole
In a can of Budweiser
If you can't take the heat son vaporizer
That old Wacky Tobaccy
When you feel it creeping up on you
That old Wacky Tobaccy
Kick back and let it do what it do

Now Do What You Do
Oh Yeah

You got your Mexican and Jamaican with those buds of blue
Humboldt County and Hydroponic too
Okeechobee Purple from down in the South
And that ol' stuff your uncle smokes 'ill give you cotton mouth
Homegrown is healthy, synthetic can kill ya
My all time favorite is redhead sensimilla

I was always the crazy one
I broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the 50 yard line
You were always the perfect one
And the valedictorian so
Under your number I wrote "Call for a good time"
And I only wanted to catch your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud
How do you like me now?!

How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy
Standing here today?
I couldn’t make you love me
But I always dreamed about
Livin' in your radio
How do you like me now?!

When I took off to Tennessee
I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into money girl
Ain't it a cruel and funny world?
He took your dreams and he tore them apart
He never comes home
And you’re always alone
And your kids hear you crying down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringing
Who could that be singing?
It's me baby, with your wake-up call!
How do you like me now?!
How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way?

"I'm just a middle-aged, middle-eastern camel herding man
I got a little, 2 bedroom cave here in North Afghanistan
Things used to be real nice and they got out of hand when they moved in
They call themselves the Taliban
(o yeah the Taliban) (Taliban baby)
Now I ain't seen my wife's face since they came here
They make her wear a scarf over her head that covers her from ear to ear
She loves the desert and the hot white sand
But man she's just like me, nah she can't stand
The Taliban (o Taliban baby)

You know someday soon we're both going to saddle up and it'll be
Ride Camel Ride
My old lady she'll be here with me, smiling right by my side
We should do just fine out around Palestine or maybe Turkmenistan
We'll bid a fair adieu and flip the finger to the Taliban
(oh yeah the Taliban) (baby)

I know where you coming from brother!
This is a patriotic love song
So y'all feel free to salute if you want
You got my permission
Now they attacked New York City cause they thought they could win
Said they would, stand and fight until the very bloody end
Mr. Bush got on the phone with Iraq and Iran and said "Now, you
Sons-of-bitches you better not be doing any business with the Taliban"
(Taliban baby)
So we prayed to Allah with all of our might
Until those big U.S. jets came flying one night
They dropped little bombs all over their holy land
And man you should have seen them run like rabbits, they ran

You know someday soon we're both going to saddle up and it'll be

I was sittin' in a bar, boozin' and losin'
And some jackoff walks up cruisin' for a bruisin'
Poppin' off and makin' my whole redneck red
He asked my girl if she'd like to dance
He had three buddies so I had no chance
I looked around the room for a friend and I saw Fred
A quick evaluation of the situation
And we entered into a conversation
It seemed to last the better part of the next two songs
Now I didn't say and they didn't ask
But Fred did two tours over in Iraq
And, son, it was over before it was even on

Call a Marine
Instead of 911
They're built to improvise, adapt and overcome
When you're in knee deep and you're up shit's creek
And you've tried everything
Tell you what you do
Call a Marine!

Now my sister's husband didn't love her no more
And he runned off with a skinny little whore
And left her sittin' around the house with a couple of kids
She just lays around in that muumuu gown
Old girl put on about 35 pounds
One day I went over to her house and I said, "Hey, sis"
If you wanna fix what troubles you
Just ease down to the VFW
And you'll walk through the door and turns those boys' heads
For most of those boys it's been awhile
Just show a little leg and that Marlboro smile
And if that don't work out for you, girl, ask for Fred
Call a Marine
Instead of 911
They're built to improvise, adapt and overcome
If you're in knee deep and you're up shit's creek
You've tried everything
Tell you what you do
Call a Marine!

Some douche bag rises up and overthrows his government
Diplomacy ain't workin' and the ammos all been spent
The world is in a crisis and the media's a curse
I'll tell you what to do
When it goes from bad to worse

Call a Marine
Instead of 911
They're built to improvise, adapt and overcome
When you're in knee deep and you're up shit's creek
And you've tried everything
Tell you what you do
Call a Marine!
Tell you what to do, baby
You can call

I always heard that his herb was top shelf
Lord I just could not wait to find out for myself
Well don't knock it till you've tried it
And I've tried it my friend
I'll never smoke Weed with Willie again!
Now we learned a hard lesson in a small Texas town
He fired up a fat boy and he passed it around
The last words I spoke before they tucked me in
I may discount Bungee jump
But I'll never smoke weed with Willie again
I'll never smoke weed with Willie again
My party's all over before it begins
You can pour me some Old Whiskey River my friend
But I'll never smoke weed with Willie again
We hopped on his old bus the Honeysuckle Rose
The party was Huntsville, it was after the show
Alone in the front lounge, just me and him
I took one friendly puff and the grim creeper set in
I'll never smoke weed with Willie again
My party's all over before it begins
You can pour me some Old Whiskey River my friend
But I'll never smoke weed with Willie again
Now we're passing the guitar, we're telling good jokes
I can tell one's a coming because I'm smelling smoke
No I do not partake I just let it pass by
With a grin on my face and a great contact high
I'll never smoke weed with Willie again
My party's all over before it begins
You can pour me some Old Whiskey River my friend
But I'll never smoke weed with Willie again
In the fetal position with drool on my chin
We broke down and smoked weed with Willie again

I'm a shitty golfer, you can ask my wife
I've been out there hackin' every day of my life
I got the shorts and all the plaid sweaters
And new Taylormade driver didn't make me any better

Man, I hit 'em fast and I hit 'em thin
I roll 'em in the bunker's man, I hit 'em again
Slice 'em in the bushes, crank 'em in a creek
I popped that sucker up and hooked it out in the street

Yeah, I'm 2-45 right down the middle
And I'll miss the green, to the left just a little
Chili dip a wedge, and put it all together
Hit that son of a bitch right up there in the leather
If you call that good, and let me press on the side
You can put me down for a five

Hey, I'm a shitty golfer, most of us are
But we carry our clubs in the back of our cars
What else you gonna do when you're out of town
And you need to waste a whole day and shoot another round
Man, I played Augusta, and I played Pebble Beach
And one time at Sawgrass I shot 83
If I live long enough to be 88
I think I'll celebrate it by shooting my age

Yeah, I'm 2-45 right down the middle
And I'll miss the green, to the left just a little
Chili dip a wedge, and put it all together
Hit that son of a bitch right up there in the leather
If you call that good, and let me press on the side
You can put me down for a five, oh yeah
You can put me down for a five1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Here you come knocking on my door baby
Tell me what you got on your mind
I guess those college boys all went home for the summertime
And you’re looking right, looking good, looking like a woman should
So why is it so hard to find
A place to lay your pretty little head down once in a while

You run on a little tough luck baby
Don’t you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you
You know I got it
Come and get it

Who’s your daddy, who’s your baby?
Who’s your buddy, who’s your friend?
And who’s the one guy that you come running to
When your love life starts tumbling?
I got the money if you got the honey
Let’s cut a deal let’s make a plan
Who’s your daddy, who’s your baby?
Who’s your buddy, who’s your man?

You might’ve run on a little tough luck baby
Don’t you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you
You know I got it
So come and get it
Who’s your daddy, who’s your baby?
Who’s your buddy, who’s your man?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
