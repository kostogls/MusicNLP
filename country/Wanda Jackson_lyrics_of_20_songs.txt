I've been to Nagasaki, Hiroshima too!
The things I did to them, baby, I can do to you!
'Cause I'm a Fujiyama Mama
And I'm just about to blow my top!
Fujiyama-yama, Fujiyama!
And when I start erupting
Ain't nobody gonna make me stop!
I drink a quart of sake, smoke dynamite!
I chase it with tobaccy and then shoot out the lights!
'Cause I'm a Fujiyama Mama
And I'm just about to blow my top!
Fujiyama-yama, Fujiyama!
And when I start erupting
Ain't nobody gonna make me stop!
Well you can talk about me, say that I'm mean!
I'll blow your head off, baby, with nitroglycerine!
'Cause I'm a Fujiyama Mama
And I'm just about to blow my top!
Fujiyama-yama, Fujiyama!
And when I start erupting
Ain't nobody gonna make me stop!
Well you can say I'm crazy, so deaf and dumb!
But I can cause destruction just like the atom bomb!
'Cause I'm a Fujiyama Mama
And I'm just about to blow my top!
Fujiyama-yama, Fujiyama!
And when I start erupting
Ain't nobody gonna make me stop!
I drink a quart of sake, smoke dynamite!
I chase it with tobaccy and then shoot out the lights!
'Cause I'm a Fujiyama Mama
And I'm just about to blow my top!

Here I go
Falling down, down, down
My mind is a blank
My head is spinning around and around
As I go deep into the funnel of love
It's such a crazy, crazy feeling
I get weak in the knees
My poor old head is a reelin'
As I go deep into the funnel of love
I tried and I tried, to run and hide
I even tried to run away
Ya just can't run from the funnel of love
It's bound to get ya someday
It's such a crazy, crazy feeling
I get weak in the knees
My poor old head is a reelin'
As I go deep into the funnel of love
I tried and I tried, to run and hide
I even tried to run away
Ya just can't run from the funnel of love
It's bound to get ya someday

My mind is a blank
My head is spinning around and around
As I go deep into the funnel of love

I don't want your lonely mansion with a tear in every room
I just want the love you promised beneath the halo'd moon
But you think I should be happy with your money and your name
And pretend that I don't notice while you play your cheatin' games
Silver threads and golden needles can't patch up this heart of mine
And I'll never drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wine
You can't buy my love with money for I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles can't patch up this heart of mine
I grew up in in faded gingham where love is a sacred thing
You grew up in silk and satin where love is a passin' game
I know now you never loved me and I know I was a fool
To think your pride would let you live by the golden rule
Silver threads and golden needles can't patch up this heart of mine
And I'll never drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wine
You can't buy my love with money for I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles can't patch up this heart of mineEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well a hard-headed woman, a soft-hearted man
Been the cause of trouble ever since the world began
Oh yeah, ever since the world began
A hard-headed woman is a thorn in the side of a man
Now Adam said to Eve, "listen here to me
Don't you let me catch you messin' round that apple tree"
Oh yeah, ever since the world began
A hard-headed woman is a thorn in the side of man, yeah yeah
Now Samson told Delilah loud and clear
Keep your cotton-pickin' fingers out of my curly hair
Oh yeah, ever since the world began
A hard-headed woman is a thorn in the side of a man
Let's go one more time then!
Well I heard about a king who's doing swell
Till he started playin' with that evil Jezebel
Oh yeah ever since the world began
A hard-headed woman is a thorn in the side of a manEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There's a cowboy that I know ridin' in the rodeo
He's a feller that I'm fondest of
I love him and he loves me and that's the way it ought to be
But he drives me crazy when we're makin' love cause he always starts to yodel (yodel)
Well he always squeezed me at night while the moon was shinin' bright
And I knew I was under his spell
He was gazin' in my eyes and I was breathing pretty sighs
Then like Tarzan he'd let out a great big yell And he started into yodel (yodel)
Well when he led me down the isle I wore such a pretty smile
And my handsome cowboy wore a buckskin suit
When the parson said will you promise always to be true
My lover smiled and gently cleared his throat and he started to yodel (yodel)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Happy, happy birthday, baby
Although you're with somebody new
Thought I'd drop a line to say
That I wish this happy day would find me beside you
Happy, happy birthday, baby
No, I can't call you my baby
Seems like years ago we met on a day I can't forget
'Cause that's when we fell in love
Do you remember the names we had for each other?
I was your pretty, you were my baby
How could we say goodbye?
Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
I'm not acting like a lady
So I'll close this note to you with good luck and wishes too

Right or wrong, I'll be with you
I'll do what you ask me to
For I believe that I belong
By your side, right or wrong
Right or wrong, it's gotta be
Always you, always me
Won't you take me along
To be with you, right or wrong?
If it's right for me to love you
It can't be wrong for me to care
If you will say you love me
My life with you, I'll share
Right or wrong, day by day
All my love, all the way

Stupid Cupid, you're a real mean guy
I'd like to cilp your wings, so you can't fly
I'm in love and it's a crying shame
And I know that you're the one to blame
Hey hey, set me free
Stupid Cupid, stop pickin' on me
I can't do my homework and I can't see straight
I meet him every morning 'bout a half past eight
I'm acting like a lovesick fool
You even got me carrying his books to school
Hey hey, set me free
Stupid Cupid, stop pickin' on me
You mixed me up but good, right from the very start
Hey, don't play Robin Hood with somebody else's heart
You got me jumpin' like a crazy clown
And I don't feature what you're puttin' down
Since I kissed his loving lips of wine
The thing that bothers me is that I like it fine

I love a mean, mean man who lives uptown
When I want him most, he's not around
He's a mean, mean man, ooh Lordy, he's a mean, mean man
He's a mean, mean man, but I love him all I can
Now he can calls at seven, wants a date at eight
He's never on time, he's always late
He's a mean, mean man, ooo, well, he's a mean, mean man
He's a mean, mean man, but I love him all I can
Now we can go to a dance, he holds me tight
But then he don't even kiss me goodnight

My clothes are all ragged, my Goodwill coat's not the best
And I'm walking on cardboard in my last dollar dress
I looked in the closet for my wedding gown
But the box that it came in was all that I found
He took everything with him that wasn't nailed down
Bet he's got a new sweetheart to fill my wedding gown
But somewhere I'll find him, then I'll have peace of mind
And the box he comes home in will be all satin-lined

Well, I thought that you was a-wantin' romance
But all you ever do is dance dance dance
So I boppity bop the whole night long
To the knocked-out music of a jukebox song
One thing I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know
If our love's the real thing, where is my weddin' ring?
Yes we rocked and rolled till the broad daylight
You're a little too pooped to kiss your baby goodnight
I know you've had it when the rockin' is through
So I let you go home, what else could I do?
One thing I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know
If our love's the real thing, where is my weddin' ring?

When you're on that floor, you're cool man, cool
But when it comes to lovin', you need to go to school
You know I'm longin' for a weddin' day
But all you ever do is play, boy, play

Woman walk out the door
Woman don't take no more
Your trouble with loving is the trouble with men
So get yourself together and get over him
Woman, woman walk out the door

I'm gonna give you some advice you just don't see
A man should love his woman
Every night and that's the key
Oh but if he's downtown running 'round
With every pretty girl in town
You don't need that kind of misery

Woman walk out the door
Woman don't take no more
Your trouble with loving is the trouble with men
So get yourself together and get over him
Woman, woman walk out the door

You're just not the happy girl I used to know
You were always the life of the party
And the queen of the rodeo
Lately you've been hanging your head down low
He's breaking your heart
And its beginning to show
Please tell me why
You don't just let him go
Woman walk out the door
Woman don't take no more
Your trouble with loving is the trouble with men
So get yourself together and get over him
Woman, woman walk out the door
Aw girl
You just keep on walking

I've got a guy, I like him fine
But he takes me for granted all of the time
To teach him a lesson, make him mad
I went out on a date with the best friend he had
That made him mad, boy
Hot dog! that made him mad
And he hugged me and he kissed me
And he asked me not to do it again
Oh, late last night, when I came in
He demanded to know just where I'd been
But I really put him right in his place
Instead of an answer, I laughed in his face
That made him mad, boy
Hot dog! that made him mad
So he hugged me and he kissed me
And he asked me not to do it again
He said my heart is on my sleeve
And if I didn't change, that he would leave
Well, you should've seen him, was his face red
When I laughed and told him just go right ahead
That made him mad, boy
Hot dog! that made him mad
So he hugged me and he kissed me
And he asked me not to do it again
Well, the moral is to play it cool
Let your guy know you're nobody's fool
When he gets to thinking you're all his own
Let him know that you can take him or leave him alone
That makes him mad, boy
Hot dog! that makes him mad
And he'll hug you and he'll kiss you
And he'll ask you not to do it again
Yeah, he'll hug you and he'll kiss you
He'll squeeze you and please you
And he'll ask you not to do it againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Thunder on the mountain, fires on the moon
A ruckus in the alley and the cops are coming soon
Today's the day, gonna grab my trombone and blow
Well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere that I go
Kept thinking about Jerry Lee, couldn't keep from crying
When he was born in Ferriday, I was living down the line
And I'm wondering where in the world could Jerry Lee be
I been looking for him clear through Tennessee
Feel like my soul is beginning to expand
Look into my heart and you'll sort of understand
You brought me here, now you're trying to turn me away
The writing's on the wall, come read it, come see what I say
He's got the pork chops, I've got the pie
He ain't no angel and neither am I
Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes
I know one thing, I don't give a dang about your dreams
Thunder on the mountain, heavy as can be
Mean old twister bearing down on me
All the ladies in Oklahoma scrambling to get out of town
Looks like a thunder of love, better roll your windows down
Everybody going and I want to go too
Don't wanna take no chance with somebody new
I did all I could, I did it right there and then
I've already confessed, no need to confess again
Thunder on the mountain, rolling on the ground
Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
Some sweet day I'll stand beside the King
I wouldn't betray your love for any other thing
The pistols are popping and the power is down
I'd like to try something but I'm far from town
The sun keeps shining and the North Wind's a-picking up speed
Forget about myself, going out to see what others need
Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north
I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth
The hammer's on the table and the pitchfork's on the shelf
For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself
I've been sitting down, studying love
I think it might just fit like a glove
I want a real good man to do just what I say
Everybody's got to wonder what's the matter with the world today
Thunder on the mountain, rolling like a drum
Going to sleep over there, where the music's coming from
Don't need a guide, I already know the way
Remember this, I'm your servant both night and dayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You are an angel, you thrill me with your magic touch
Ooh when you kiss me and hold me tightly in your arms

And in the daytime, you're all I ever think about
When I am near you, you set my heart and soul on fire

Your very presence sets me all aglow
Won't you place the ring upon my finger?
