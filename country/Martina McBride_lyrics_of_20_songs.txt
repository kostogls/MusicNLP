She walks to school with the lunch she packed
Nobody knows what she's holdin' back
Wearin' the same dress she wore yesterday
She hides the bruises with linen and lace

The teacher wonders, but she doesn't ask
It's hard to see the pain behind the mask
Bearin' the burden of a secret storm
Sometimes she wishes she was never born

Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she's loved
Concrete angel

Somebody cries in the middle of the night
The neighbours hear, but they turn out the light
A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate
When mornin' comes it'll be too late
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she's loved
Concrete angel

A statue stands in a shaded place
An angel girl with an upturned face
A name is written on a polished rock
A broken heart that the world forgot

Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she's loved
Concrete angel4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well she seemed all right by dawn's early light
Though she looked a little worried and weak
She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again
But daddy left the proof on her cheek
And I was only eight years old that summer
And I always seemed to be in the way
So, I took myself down to the fair in town
On Independence Day

Well, word gets around in a small, small town
They said he was a dangerous man
But mama was proud and she stood her ground
She knew she was on the losin' end
Some folks whispered, some folks talked
But everybody looked the other way
When time ran out there was no one about
On Independence Day

Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today, is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay, it's Independence Day
Well she lit up the sky that fourth of July
By the time that the firemen come
They just put out the flames and took down some names
And sent me to the county home
Now, I ain't sayin' it's right or it's wrong
But maybe it's the only way
Talk about your revolution
It's Independence Day

Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today, is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay, it's Independence Day

Roll the stone away
It's Independence DayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If there were no words
No way to speak
I would still hear you
If there were no tears
No way to feel inside
I'd still feel for you

And even if the sun refused to shine
Even if romance ran out of rhyme
You would still have my heart until the end of time
You're all i need, my love, my Valentine

All of my life
I have been waiting for
All you give to me
You've opened my eyes
And shown me how to love unselfishly
I've dreamed of this a thousand times before
In my dreams i couldn't love you more
I will give you my heart
Until the end of time
You're all i need, my love, my Valentine
Ra lala lala lalaaaahhh
And even if the sun refused to shine
Even if romance ran out of rhyme
You would still have my heart until the end of time
'cause all i need is you, my Valentine
You're all i need, my love, my Valentine1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She loved him like he was
The last man on Earth
Gave him everything she ever had
He'd break her spirit down
Then come loving up on her
Give a little, then take it back
She'd tell him about her dreams
He'd just shoot 'em down
Lord he loved to make her cry
"You're crazy for believing
You'll ever leave the ground"
He said, "Only angels know how to fly"
And with a broken wing
She still sings
She keeps an eye on the sky
With a broken wing
She carries her dreams
Man, you ought to see her fly
One Sunday morning
She didn't go to church
He wondered why she didn't leave
He went up to the bedroom
Found a note by the window
With the curtains blowin' in the breeze
And with a broken wing
She still sings
She keeps an eye on the sky
With a broken wing
She carries her dreams
Man, you ought to see her fly
With a broken wing
She carries her dreams
Man, you ought to see her
Flyyyyyyyyyyyyy

She dropped the phone and burst into tears
The doctor just confirmed her fears
Her husband held it in and held her tight
Cancer don’t discriminate or care if you’re just 38
With three kids who need you in their lives
He said, "I know that you’re afraid and I am, too
But you’ll never be alone, I promise you"

When you’re weak, I’ll be strong
When you let go, I’ll hold on
When you need to cry, I swear that I’ll be there to dry your eyes
When you feel lost and scared to death
Like you can’t take one more step
Just take my hand, together we can do it
I'm going to love you through it

She made it through the surgery fine
They said they caught it just in time
But they had to take more than they planned
Now it's forced smiles and baggy shirts
To hide what the cancer took from her
But she just wants to feel like a woman again
She said, "I don't think I can do this anymore"
He took her in his arms and said "That's what my love is for"
When you’re weak, I’ll be strong
When you let go, I’ll hold on
When you need to cry, I swear that I’ll be there to dry your eyes
When you feel lost and scared to death
Like you can’t take one more step
Just take my hand, together we can do it
I'm going to love you through it
Oh baby
Yeah
And when this road gets too long
I'll be the rock you lean on
Just take my hand, together we can do it
I'm going to love you through it
I'm going to love you through it
I'm going to love you through itEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In my daughter's eyes I am a hero
I am strong and wise and I know no fear
But the truth is plain to see
She was sent to rescue me
I see who I want to be
In my daughter's eyes
In my daughter's eyes everyone is equal
Darkness turns to light and the
World is at peace
This miracle God gave to me
Gives me strength when I am weak
I find reason to believe
In my daughter's eyes
And when she wraps her hand around my finger
Oh it puts a smile in my heart
Everything becomes a little clearer
I realize what life is all about
It's hanging on when your heart has had enough
It's giving more when you feel like giving up
I've seen the light
It's in my daughter's eyes
In my daughter's eyes I can see the future
A reflection of who I am and what will be
Though she'll grow and someday leave
Maybe raise a family
When I'm gone I hope you see
How happy she made me
For I'll be there
In my daughter's eyes3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You can spend your whole life buildin'
Somethin' from nothin'
One storm can come and blow it all away
Build it anyway
You can chase a dream
That seems so out of reach
And you know it might not ever come your way
Dream it anyway
God is great, but sometimes life ain't good
And when I pray
It doesn't always turn out like I think it should
But I do it anyway, I do it anyway
This world's gone crazy
And it's hard to believe
That tomorrow will be better than today
Believe it anyway
You can love someone with all your heart
For all the right reasons
And in a moment they can choose to walk away
Love 'em anyway
God is great
But sometimes life ain't good
And when I pray
It doesn't always turn out like I think it should
But I do it anyway
Yeah, I do it anyway
You can pour your soul out singin'
A song you believe in
That tomorrow they’ll forget you ever sang
Sing it anyway
Yeah, sing it anyway, yeah yeah
I sing, I dream, I love anyway, yeah1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah

The sun is shining everyday
The clouds never get in the way for you and me
I've known you just a week or two
But baby I'm so into you
Can hardly breathe

And I'm in so totally wrapped up
Emotionally attracted
So physically acting
So recklessly I need you
So desperately sure as the sky is blue
Baby, I love you
I love you

I never knew that I could feel like this
Can hardly wait till our next kiss
You're so cool
If I'm dreaming, please don't wake me up
Because baby I can't get enough
Of what you do
And I'm in so electrically charged up
Kinetically acting
Erratically need you
Fanatically you get to me
Magically sure as the sky is blue
Baby, I love you

I, I can't believe that this is real
The way I feel
Baby, I'm gone head over heels
(Head over heels)

And I'm in so totally wrapped up
Emotionally attracted
So physically acting
So recklessly I need you
So desperately sure as the sky is blue

I met God's Will on a Halloween night
He was dressed as a bag of leaves
It hid the braces on his legs at first
His smile was as bright as the August sun
When he looked at me
As he struggled down the driveway
It almost made me hurt
Will don't walk too good
Will don't talk too good
He won't do the things that the other kids do
In our neighborhood

I've been searching, wondering, thinking
Lost and looking all my life
I've been wounded, jaded, loved, and hated
I've wrestled wrong and right
He was a boy without a father
And his mother's miracle
I've been reading, writing, praying, fighting
I guess I would be still
Yeah, that was until
I knew God's Will

Will's mom had to work two jobs
We'd watch him when she had to work late
And we'd all laugh like I hadn't laughed
Since I don't know when
"Hey Jude" was his favorite song
At dinner he'd ask to pray
And then he'd pray for everybody in the world but him
I've been searching, wondering, thinking
Lost and looking all my life
I've been wounded, jaded, loved, and hated
I've wrestled wrong and right
He was a boy without a father
And his mother's miracle
I've been reading, writing, praying, fighting
I guess I would be still
Yeah, that was until
I knew God's Will

Before they moved to California
His mother said, they didn't think he'd live
And she said each day that I have him
Well, it's just another gift
And I never got to tell her
That the boy showed me the truth
In crayon red, on notebook paper, he'd written
Me and God love you

I've been searching, praying, wounded, jaded
I guess I would be still
Yeah that was until
I met God's Will on a Halloween night
He was dressed as a bag of leavesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Don't need no copy of vogue magazine
Don't need to dress like no Beauty Queen
High heels or sneakers, he don't give a damn
My baby loves me just the way that I am
My baby loves me just the way that I am

He never tells me I'm not good enough
Just gives me unconditional love
He loves me tender, he loves me mad
He loves me silly and he loves me sad

He thinks I'm pretty, he thinks I'm smart
He likes my nerve and he loves my heart
He's always saying he's my biggest fan
My baby loves me just the way that I am
My baby loves me just the way that I am

When there's dark clouds in my eyes
He just sits back and lets 'em roll on by
Come in like a lion and go out like a lamb
My baby loves me just the way that I am
My baby loves me just the way that I am
He thinks I'm pretty, he thinks I'm smart
He likes my nerve and he loves my heart
He's always saying he's my biggest fan
My baby loves me just the way that I am

He likes my nerve and he loves my heart
Don't see no reason to change my plan

Oh holy night!
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth!
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Until He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine

I pinch myself
Sometimes to make sure I'm not in a dream
That's how it seems
I close my eyes
And breathe in the sweetest moments I've ever known
It feels like home
And here I am
I want to be your everything
There you are
Turning winter into spring
And everyone that sees you
Always wants to know you
And everyone that knows you
Always has a smile
You're a standing ovation
After take years of waiting
For a chance to finally shine
Everyone calls you amazing
Yeah, I just call you mine
I fall apart
And just a word from you somehow seems to fix
Whatever's wrong, oh
You reach into the weakest moments
And remind me that I'm strong
You got to know
I'd be a fool not to see or even worse to forget
That you're more than I deserve
And everyone that sees you
Always wants to know you
And everyone that knows you
Always has a smile
You're a standing ovation
After take years of waiting
For a chance to finally shine
Everyone calls you amazing
Yeah, I just call you mine
Nothing makes sense when you're not here
As if my whole world disappears
Without you what's the point of it
And everyone that sees you
Always wants to know you
And everyone that knows you
Always has a smile
You're a dream I've been chasing
After take years of waiting
For a chance to finally shine
Everyone calls you amazing
Yeah, I just call you mineEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

From the day we met
You made me forget
All my fears
Knew just what to say
And you kissed away
All my tears
I knew this time I had finally found
Someone to build my life around
Be a lover and a friend
After all my heart had put me through
I knew that it was safe with you
And what we had would never end
Wrong again
Everybody swore
They'd seen this before
We'd be fine
And you'd come to see that you still loved me
In good time
And they said there's nothing you can do
It's something that he's going through
It happens to a lot of men
And I told myself that they were right
That you'd wake up and see the light
And I just had to wait 'til then
Wrong again
And it seemed to me the pain would last
My chance for happiness had passed
And nothing waited 'round the bend
I was sure I'd never find someone
To heal the damage you had done
My poor heart would never mend
Wrong again
Wrong againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Between the perfect world and the bottom line
Keeping love alive in these troubled times
Well, it's a miracle in itself
And we know too well what that's about
Still we made it through, only God knows how
We must've had a little help

It must've been wild angels, wild angels
Watching over you and me, yeah
Wild angels, wild angels
Baby, what else could it be?

Well, it must've been hard, it must've been tough
Keeping up with crazy fools like us
'Cause it's so easy to fall apart
And we still break each other's hearts sometimes
Spend some nights on the jagged side
Somehow we wake up in each other's arms

Oh, it must've been wild angels, wild angels
Watching over you and me, yeah
Wild angels, wild angels
Baby, what else could it be?
There are some nights
I watch you while you dream

To get you off my mind
And I may sometimes bother you
Try to be in touch with you
Even ask too much of you
From time to time
Now and then
Lord ya know I'll need a friend
Til I get used to losing you
Let me keep on using you
Til I can make it on my own

But no matter how I try
There'll be times you know I'll call
Chances are my tears will fall
And I'll have no pride at all
From time to time
But they say
Oh there'll be a brighter day
But til then I'll lean on you
That's all I mean to do
Til I can make it on my own
Surely someday I'll wake up and see the morning sun
Without another lonely night behind me
Then I'll know I'm over you and all my cryings done

I used to live in a darkened room
Had a face of stone
And a heart of gloom
Lost my hope, I was so far gone
Crying all my tears
With the curtains drawn
I didn't know until my soul broke free
I've got these angels watching over me

Oh watch me go
I'm a happy girl
Everybody knows
That the sweetest thing you'll ever see
In the whole wide world
Is a happy girl

I used to hide in a party crowd
Bottled up inside
Feeling so left out
Standing in a corner wearing concrete shoes
With my frozen smile
And my lighted fuse
Now every time I start to feel like that
I roll my heart out like a welcome mat

Laugh when I feel like it
Cry when I feel like it
That's just how my life is
That's how it goes

I get kissed by the sun
Each morning
Put my feet on a hardwood floor
I get to hear my children laughing
Down the hall through the
Bedroom door
Sometimes I sit on my
Front porch swing
Just soaking up the day
I think to myself, I think to myself
This world is a beautiful place

I have been blessed
And I feel like I've found my way
I thank God for all I've been given
At the end of every day
I have been blessed
With so much more than I deserve
To be here with the ones
That love me
To love them so much it hurts
I have been blessed

Across a crowded room
I know you know what I'm thinking
By the way I look at you
And when we're lying in the quiet
And no words have to be said
I think to myself, I think to myself
This love is a beautiful gift

When I'm singing my kids to sleep
When I feel you holding me
I know
