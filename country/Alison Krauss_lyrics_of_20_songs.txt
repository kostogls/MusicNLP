Baby mine, don't you cry
Baby mine, dry your eyes
Rest your head close to my heart
Never to part, baby of mine

Little one, when you play
Don't you mind what they say
Let those eyes sparkle and shine
Never a tear, baby of mine

If they knew sweet little you
They'd end up loving you, too
All those same people who scold you
What they'd give just for the right to hold you

From your head down to your toes
You're not much, goodness knows
But you're so precious to me
Sweet as can be, baby of mine

All of those people who scold you
What they'd give just for the right to hold you
From your head down to your toes
You're not much, goodness knows
But you're so precious to me
Sweet as can be, baby of mine

As I went down in the river to pray
Studying about that good ol' way
And who shall wear the starry crown?
Good Lord show me the way!

O sisters let's go down
Let's go down, come on down

Down in the river to pray

Don't sigh a sigh for me
Don't ever cry for me
This is goodbye from me
I know we're through
I'm losing you

Love sang its song for me
Then things went wrong for me
Nights are too long for me
Because I'm losing you

Our love and our devotion
Were deep as any ocean
Then one day, like the tide
You began to change
And you became a perfect stranger

Someone is holding you
Sharing the lips I knew
I can't believe it's true
That I am losing you
I can't believe it's true
That I am losing… you…EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I knew in this heart of mine
That you were someone I couldn't forget
I said right, and I bide my time
Spent my life looking for that somebody
To make me feel like you
Now you tell me that you want to leave me
But darling, I just can't let you

Where have you been
My long lost friend
It's good to see you again
Come and sit for a while
I've missed your smile
Today the past is goodbye
Time can't erase
A lover's embrace
Can't you hear it calling
A new day dawning
You were longing to find
Love's taken you far
Away from my heart
And I've been here all along
Have your eyes failed to find
What took you from mine
A vision that's faded through time
But you sail away
Far on a summer's day
But you heard it calling
A new day dawning
You were longing to find
There is a way
To make you stay
Darling don't turn away
Don't doubt your heart
And keep us apart
I'm right where you are
Stay
There is a way
To make you stay
Darling don't turn away
Don't doubt your heart
And keep us apart
I'm right where you are
StayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I've spent my life lookin' for you
And findin' my way wasn't easy to do
But I knew there was you all the while
And it's been worth every mile

So lay down beside me and love me and hide me
And kiss all the hurtin' of this world away
And hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat
And don't ever wander away

Mornings and evenings all were the same
I heard no music 'til I heard your name
I knew when I saw you smile
And now I can rest for a while

So lay down beside me, love me and hide me
And kiss all the hurtin' of this world away
Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat
And don't ever wander away

Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat
And don't ever wander away
Love me and hide me
'Til I feel your heartbeatEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Little yellow house sittin' on a hill
That is where he lived
That is where he died
Every Sunday morning
Hear the weeping willows cry

Two children born
A beautiful wife
Four walls and livin's all he needed in life
Always giving, never asking back
I wish I had a simple love like that

I want a simple love like that
Always giving, never askin' back
For when I'm in my final hour lookin' back
I hope I had a simple love like that

My momma was his only little girl
If he'd had the money he'd have given her the world
Sittin' on the front porch together they would sing
Oh how I long to hear that harmony
I want a simple love like that
Always giving never asking back
When I'm in my final hour looking back
I hope I had a simple love like that

I want a simple love like that
Always giving never asking back
When I'm in my final hour looking back
I hope I had a simple love like thatEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We came to big city, from our little country town
And every step he takes with you, is down
And you're as cold and heartless, as your chilling winds that blow
Before you freeze his heart, please let him go

Windy City; you're haunting my baby
With your bright lights and your avenues so wild
Windy City; turn loose of my baby
If you don't give him back, I'll lose my mind


At night I walk your sidewalks, and look in every bar
I love him even though, he's gone too far
Your swinging doors stay open, just to keep him from my side
And I'm on your lonely streets, again tonight

Windy City; you're haunting my baby
With your bright lights and your avenues so wild
Windy City; turn loose of my baby
And if you don't give him back, I'll lose my mind
If you don't give him back, I'll lose my mind ...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If you had not have fallen
Then I would not have found you
Angel flying too close to the ground
And I patched up your broken wing
And hung around for a while
Trying to keep your spirits
And your fever down

I knew someday that you would fly away
For love's the greatest healer, to be found

So leave me if you need to
I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground

Fly on, fly on past, the speed of sound
I'd rather see you up, than to see you down

So leave me if you need to
I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground ...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

River in the rain
Sometimes at night you look like a long white train
Winding your way away somewhere
River I love you don't you care?
But if you're on the run
Winding some place, just tryna find the sun
Whether the sunshine, whether the rain
River I love you just the same

But sometimes, in a time of trouble
When you're out of hand and your muddy bubbles
Roll across my floor
Carrying away the things I treasure
Hell there ain't ain't no way to measure
Why I love you more, than I did the day before

River in the rain
Sometimes at night you look like a long white train
Winding your way away from me
River I've never seen the sea

But sometimes in a time of trouble

Carrying away the things I treasure

Just like the sun over the mountain top
You know I'll always come again
You know I love to spend my morning time
Like sunlight dancing on your skin

I've never gone so wrong as to telling lies to you
And what you've seen is what I've been
And there is nothing I could hide from you
You see me better than I can

Out on the road that leads before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
Till I can gain control again


Like a lighthouse you must stand alone
Landmark the sailor's journeys end
No matter what seas I've have been sailing on
I'll always roll this way again
Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
Till I can gain control again

Till I can gain control againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Same old place, same old city
What can I do? I'm falling in love
I'm just an old hound dog
Roaming around door to door
I've got all this and heaven above

Oh, Atlanta, I hear you callin'
I'm coming back to you one fine day
No need to worry
There ain't no hurry 'cause I'm
On my way back to Georgia
On my way back to Georgia

I get a feeling in me
When I remember all those crazy days and crazier nights
Can't you hear the music playing?
You must have heard them saying
"We're gonna rip 'em up and light up the night"

Oh, Atlanta, I hear you callin'
I'm coming back to you one fine day
Hey, no need to worry
There ain't no hurry 'cause I'm
On my way back to Georgia
On my way back to Georgia

Same old place, it's the same old city
What can I do? I'm falling in love
I'm just an old hound dog
Roaming around, Lord, Lord
I've got all this and heaven above

Oh, Atlanta, I hear you callin'
I'm coming back to you one fine day
Hey, no need to worry
There ain't no hurry 'cause I'm

I don't pick up the mail
I don't pick up the phone
I don't answer the door
I'd just soon be alone
I don't keep this place up
I just keep the lights down
I don't live in these rooms
I just rattle around

I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls
As quietly as a mouse I haunt these halls
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control
You took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house

I don't care if it rains
I don't care if it's clear
I don't mind staying in
There's another ghost here
He sits down in your chair
And he shines with your light
And he lays down his head
On your pillow at night
I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls
I'm living proof of the damage heartbreak does
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control
You took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house

That once burned out of control

You'll walk unscathed through musket fire
No ploughman's blade will cut thee down
No cutlass wound will mar thy face
And you will be my ain true love
And you will be my ain true love

And as you walk through death's dark veil
The cannons' thunder can't prevail
And those who hunt thee down will fail
And you will be my ain true love
And you will be my ain true love

Asleep inside the cannon's mouth
The captain cries, "Here comes the rout!"
They'll seek to bind me North and South
I've gone to find my ain true love

The field is cut and bleeds to red
The cannon balls fly 'round my head
The infirmary man may count me dead
When I've gone to find my ain true love
I've gone to find my ain true loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Forget about it
I'm admitting I was wrong
And I'll just take what's mine
And walk right out the door
Forget about it
I'll split and I'll be gone
And you'll have memories
You'll find hard to ignore
'Cause after all I'll see you sometime, baby
When I can't recall how you drove me crazier
Forget about it
When forever's over
I won't remember
How much I loved you anymore
Forget about it
Put me out of your head
Now that you're free and easy
Out there on the town
Forget about it
When you're lyin' in bed
Just wishin' I was there
To lay on down
'Cause after all I'll see you sometime, baby
When you will recall how I drove you crazier
Forget about those starlit nights
Layin' by the fireside holdin' you tight
I can't remember when it felt so right
So just forget about it
Forget about it
When you see me on the street
Don't look, don't wave
Don't try to tease me with your smile
Forget about it
If we chance to meet somewhere
Don't think it's 'cause I'm tryin' to reconcile
'Cause after all I'll see you sometime, baby
When I can't recall how you drove me crazier
Forget about those starlit nights
Layin' by the fireside holdin' you tight
I can't remember when it felt so right

Well, I recall his parting words
Must I accept his fate?
Or take myself far from this place
I thought I heard a black bell toll
A little bird did sing
Man has no choice when he wants everything

We'll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the bride

Man goes beyond his own decision
Gets caught up in the mechanism
Of swindlers who act like kings
And brokers who break everything
The dark of night was swiftly fading
Close to the dawn of day
Why would I want him just to lose him again?

We'll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the bride
We'll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the brideEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My life on the road, its been hard on me and you
Every time we say goodbye, it gets harder to do
But when I'm far away somewhere alone, and the missing you starts
All I got to do is picture you, and I can feel you in my heart

So dream of me
Every time you get to feeling blue
Dream of me
And I'll be dreaming of you


I've been a lot of places, but there's no place like home
And I'm on my way back to you, every minute that I'm gone
So when you get to feeling lonely, just remember we won't always be apart
Close your eyes and think of me, and you can feel me in your heart

So dream of me
Every time you get to feeling blue
Dream of me
And I'll, be dreaming of you
Dream of me
Every time you get to feeling blue
Dream of me
And I'll, be dreaming of you

You can send me pretty flowers
You can send me valentines
Send me letters every day but it won’t pay
Leap to my desires, nothing else will do
It’s goodbye and so long to you!

You can hang around and love me
You can hang your head and cry
Hang my picture on the wall, but I won’t fall
Kiss me when you're dreaming, no good that will do
It’s goodbye and so long to you!


You can give me your affection
You can give me all your love
Give me all the things I crave, but I’ll be brave
All the things you offer, make me sad and blue
It’s goodbye and so long to you!

You can hang around and love me
You can hang your head and cry
Hang my picture on the wall, but I won’t fall
Kiss me when you're dreaming, no good that will do
It’s goodbye and so long to you!
You can call me your own darling
You can call me what you may
Call me on the telephone I won’t be home
Keep your old love letters, I’m all through with you
It’s goodbye and so long to you!

In the spring of 1856, with the snow still on the ground
Two little boys were lost in the mountains above the town
The father went out hunting; the boys had stayed behind
While mother tended to her chores, they wandered from her side

The two had gone to follow him and lost their way instead
By dusk the boys had not been found and fear had turned to dread
Two hundred men had gathered there to comb the mountainside
The fires were built on the highest peak in hopes they'd see the light

Oh Mommy and Daddy, why can't you hear our cries?
The day is almost over, soon it will be night
We're so cold and hungry and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door

Now Jacob Dibert woke one night from a strange and eerie dream
He saw a path between two hills near a dark and swollen stream
He told his wife he saw the boys huddled close beside a log
For two more nights, the dream returned, this vision sent from God

Oh Mommy and Daddy, why can't you hear our cries?
The day is almost over, soon it will be night
We're so cold and hungry and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door
A thousand men had searched in vain the west side of Bob's Creek
But Jacob's wife knew of this place and said to travel east
With a guide to take him there, Jacob came upon the scene
And found the boys cold and still, beneath the old birch tree

Oh Mommy and Daddy, look past the tears you cry
We're both up in heaven now; God is by our side
As you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord
Know that we will meet you here at heaven's door

Oh Mommy and Daddy, look past the tears you cry
We're both up in heaven now; God is by our side
And as you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord
Know that we will meet you here at heaven's doorEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of our hands say you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

All day long I can hear people talking aloud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
Old Mr. Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of our hands say you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of our hands say you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
