I close my eyes and she's right there
Barbie dolls and teddy bears
Picking buttercups from the yard
Putting them in mason jars
Tea parties and pecan pie
Make me think of her every time
Yes sir, yes maam
It wouldn't be who I am

If it wasn't for a woman
Leading me by the hand
Helping me understand
If it wasn't for a woman
Teaching me wrong from right
Praying for me at night
I'd be half the woman I am
If it wasn't for a woman

Met a man that treats me good
Opens my door like a gentleman should
She'd always said "Don't settle for less"
Sometimes when I miss her
I can still hear her sweet hearts
"I love you, be safe"
I wouldn't be here today
If it wasn't for a woman
Leading me by the hand
Helping me understand
If it wasn't for a woman
Teaching me wrong from right
Praying for me at night
I'd be half the woman I am
If it wasn't for a woman

She saw your face in a photograph
Asked "who is this beauty with a Bible in her hand"
I said "She's my angel and I'm the girl who wouldn't know how to face this world"

If it wasn't for a woman
Leading me by the hand
Helping me understand
If it wasn't for a woman
Teaching me wrong from right
Praying for me at night
I'd be half the woman I am
If it wasn't for a womanEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met 'til you were making me cry
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

Ain't it a shame?
A shame that every time you hear my name
Brought up in a casual conversation
You can't think straight?
And ain't it sad
You can't forget about what we had?
Take a look at her and do you like what you see
Or do you wish it was me?

'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met to the very last night
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

And does she know
Know about the times you used to hold me
Wrapped me in your arms and how you told me
I'd be the only one?
I heard about
Yeah, someone told me once when you were out
She went a little crazy, ran her mouth about me
Ain't jealousy funny?
'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met to the very last night
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

Life with me was a fairytale love
I was head over heels 'til you threw away us
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

I heard you're gonna get married, have a nice little family
Live out my dreams with someone new
But I've been told that a cheater is always a cheater
So I've got my pride and she's got you

'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met 'til you were making me cry
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

Of your life, oh, oh yeah
You're gonna think of me
You're gonna think of me in your life
Oh, oh, yeah
It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shameEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Sometimes I think about you
Wonder if you're out there somewhere thinkin' 'bout me
And would you even recognize
The woman that your little girl has grown up to be?

'Cause I look in the mirror, and all I see
Are your brown eyes, lookin' back at me
They're the only thing, you ever gave to me at all

Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California
There's sunny skies as far I can see
If you ever come back home to Carolina
I wonder what you'd say to me

I think about how it ain't fair
That you weren't there to braid my hair like mothers do
You weren't around to cheer me on
Help me dress for my high school prom like mothers do

Did you think I didn't need you here?
To hold my hand, to dry my tears
Did you even miss me, through the years at all?
Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California
There's sunny skies as far I can see
If you ever come back home to Carolina
I wonder what you'd say to me

Forgiveness
Is such a simple word
But it's so hard to do
When you've been hurt

Oh, I hear the weather's nice in California
And just in case, you're wonderin' about me
From now on, I won't be in Carolina
Your little girl is off... your little girl is off...
Your little girl is off to Tennessee3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I remember the way you made love to me
Like I was all you'd ever need
Did you change your mind?
Well, I didn't change mine
Now here I am trying to make sense of it all
We were best friends, now we don't even talk
You broke my heart
Ripped my world apart

Didn't you know how much I loved you?
Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby?
I gave you everything, every part of me
Didn't you feel it when I touched you?
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby?
Baby, tell me
Didn't you know how much I loved you?

I can't get you out of my head
I still feel you in this bed
Left me all alone
You couldn't be more gone
From falling apart to fighting mad
From wanting you back to not giving a damn
I've felt it all
I've been to the wall
Didn't you know how much I loved you?
Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby?
I gave you everything, every part of me
Didn't you feel it when I touched you?
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby?
Baby, tell me
Didn't you know how much I loved you?

One day justice will come and find you
And I'll be right there in your memory to remind you

Didn't you know how much I loved you?
Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby?
I gave you everything, every part of me
Didn't you feel it when I touched you?
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby?
Baby, tell me

Baby, I got plans tonight you don't know nothin' about
I've been sittin' 'round way too long tryin' to figure you out
But you say that you'll call and you don't
And I'm spinnin' my wheels
So I'm goin' out tonight in my red high heels

I'm gonna call up that old boyfriend
Who says he still has it bad for me
I'm gonna take him into town
Flaunt him around for everyone to see
Well, you said once yourself, baby
Yeah, you know the deal
Nobody holds a candle to me
In my red high heels

Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
I bet you want me back now, don't you, don't you?
I'm about to show you just how missin' me feels
In my red high heels

All those games you tried to play
Well, they ain't gonna work on me now
I put a barbed wire fence around my heart, baby
Just to keep you out
Well, you thought I'd wait around forever
But baby, get real
I just kicked you to the curb in my red high heels
Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
I bet you want me back now, don't you, don't you?
I'm about to show you just how missin' me feels
In my red high heels
Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to

Hey, little girl with your tangled hair
Your tattered clothes
You're 15
And you're bound to bloom just like a rose
You're wishing that you had designer jeans
Like the ones you see in magazines
I know you'd give anything just to fit in
But you aren't on a price tag, it comes from within

Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Just the way you are

Hey, there little homecoming queen
In that back seat
I bet his brown eyes
Are promising you everything
I know you want to be just like your friend
But he'll still love you if you don't give in
If those girls are being honest that have been where you're at
I bet they'd tell you that they wish they had their innocence back
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Just the way you are

Still he left you for a girl that could be your twin
If you were twenty-eight again
Let him go (let him go)
Let him fly (let him fly)
Keep your head up get on with your life

Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Don't you know you're beautiful?

Every day when school got out
I'd get off the bus and I'd run down
That old dirt road where you were waiting for me
On the front porch in that blue swing
You'd be smiling and we would sing
'Amazing Grace' and 'Jesus Loves Me'

You were like my mother
You were my best friend
You were everything I want to be
And all the good inside of me
There's never been
Never been another
That loved me like you did
My grandmother, my angel

Even though I can't touch your face
I feel you with me every day
I wish you could see all my dreams coming true
When I get lost I close my eyes
And I feel you shining down so bright
I feel you shining down on me
You were like my mother
You were my best friend
You were everything I want to be
And all the good inside of me
There's never been
Never been another
That loved me like you did
My grandmother, my angel

I grew up where I could see the stars
Drinking sweet tea from a Mason jar
Dogwood trees like leaves through the pine
People on the porch watching fireflies
And driving 'round the Wal-Mart on a Friday night

I'm just a small town girl
And that's all I'll ever be
I'm just a small town girl
Hey, that's alright with me

I'd rather be fishin' with grandpa on the lake
Then getting all glammed up
Fake eyelashes on my face
Cut off jeans and an old ball cap
A town so small you don't need a map
That's where I'm from and there ain't no changing me

I'm just a small town girl
And that's all I'll ever be
I'm just a small town girl
Hey, that's alright with me
I'd rather ride in a Chevy truck than a Ferrari
Give me a cheeseburger
I ain't eating no calamari

I'm just a small town girl
And that's all I'll ever be
I'm just a small town girl
Hey, that's alright with me

Coca-cola and apple pie
Dirt roads and old clothes lines
Familiar faces and dandelion bracelets
You never meet a stranger
And everybody helps out
Soft green grass, Sunday school and wild flowers
Driving
Driving
Driving
Driving around

I'm just a small town girl
I'm just a small town girl
I'm just a small town girl
I'm just a small town girlEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

People will tell you that this kind of love will fade
That being in love like this is only a phase
But baby, after all this time, ain't nothin' changed
All you gotta do is look at me that way

And there you go makin' me fall in love again
There you go makin' me fall in love again

Oh, and I gotta tell you there's nothin' better
You and me together, workin' on forever
Everyday with you is always somethin' new
You only gotta be yourself
And there you go makin' me fall in love again

Baby, sometimes you can say the craziest things
I love how you don't care what nobody thinks
You're highly original, totally in-typical, never change
All I gotta do is look at your smiling face

There you go makin' me fall in love again
There you go makin' me fall in love again
Oh, and I gotta tell you there's nothin' better

Sometimes the night seems so long
When you lie in bed all alone
And tomorrow seems so far away
I don't wanna live another day this way
Scared to let someone in
Can't bear to get hurt again
But my body needs to feel a touch
Someone come and wake me up

I just want somebody to love me
I just need somebody to hold me
Somebody to love me

Don't wanna let life pass me by
Never knowing what it's like
To be as real as real can be
To share my life and know my dreams

I just want somebody to love me
I just need somebody to hold me
Somebody to love me
Cause I'm hurt and I'm scared and I'm lonely
All I want is somebody to want me
'Cause I've got so much to give

I just want somebody to love me
I just need somebody to hold me

Are you fast asleep, lost in a dream
Or are you still awake, thinking of me
I never showed up
Yeah, I never showed up

Would it be alright if I said let's go
And then we drove all night
Past the city glow and
We were all alone
Yeah, if we were all alone?
Would you, would you?

Put your hand in my pocket
Spin me 'round, spin me 'round
Catch my heart before I drop it
On the ground, on the ground
Promise me you ain't stopping
What you're doing right now
'Cause what you're doing right now is
Sunshine at midnight
Hey are you feeling just what I'm feeling
Summer fa-feeling, any kind of feeling
You're feeling like feeling tonight
How ya feeling tonight?
Would you fall with me?
Let go completely
Write our names in our hearts
Bright red graffiti on a white wall
Would you run with me all night long?
Would you, would you?

Every word on your lips, pour 'em out, pour 'em out
Wanna get to, get to you, tell me how, show me how
Promise me you ain't stopping
What you're doing right now
'Cause what you're doing right now is
Sunshine at midnight

I know you loved her
A long time ago
Even now in my arms
You still want her, I know
But darling, this time
Let your memories die
When you hold me tonight
Don’t close your eyes

Don’t close your eyes, let it be me
Don’t pretend it’s her in some fantasy
Darling, just once let yesterday go
And you'll find more love than you’ve ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don’t close your eyes

Maybe I've been a fool
Holding on all this time
Lying here in your arms
Knowin' she’s in your mind
But I keep hoping someday
That you’ll see the light
Let it be me tonight
And don’t close your eyes
Don’t close your eyes, let it be me

I wanted lace, I wanted pearls, to be a princess like
The other girls
But life came hard, to my front door
And I grew up trying
To even out the score
Tough, I ain't never been nothing but tough, all my edges have
Always been rough

But Jesus loves me anyway
Oh backbone, there ain't nothing wrong with a woman that
Got a little backbone

You just wait 'til you taste her kind of love
You want a shy little thing, a pretty little high heel thing
Going to cry if I don't polish up
Tough

The way I see it, the hand of fate, did me a favor, with
The cards he dealt my way
Found out real fast, life is a game
You're out real quick if you don't know how to play, tough
I ain't never been nothing but tough
All my edges have always been rough
But Jesus loves me anyway
Oh backbone, there ain't nothing wrong with a woman that
Got a little backbone

You just wait 'til you taste her kind of love
You want a shy little thing, a pretty little high heel thing
Going to cry if I don't polish up

Are you serious? You ain't fooled me much
You just a hanging round
So you can try your luck
Well tough, I ain't never been nothing but tough
All my edges has always been rough
You want a shy little thing, a pretty little high heel thing
Going to cry if I don't polish up

Before you let your sweet heart get in too deep
A white picket fence don't feel like home
Don't wanna rock I need a rolling stone
You wanna hold me

I'm a traveling circus train
Spinning weathervane
Going where the wind blows (Yeah)
I was born to chase the sun
Some horses gotta run
Yeah, I'm always gonna be
A little bit gypsy

Someday, hey, maybe I'll settle down
But it sure ain't anytime close to now
So much that I might miss you
Sit still for a single minute
I got a life and I'm going to live it
The only way I know how

Just look in my closet
Not a thing to put on
I wonder how these jeans make me look from behind
Things that never cross a man's mind
Lets turn off the TV
Now can't we just talk
Lets lay here and cuddle
Till we both drift off
If we don't make love
That'll be just fine
Things that never cross a man's mind

That joke is too dirty
This steak is too thick
Ain't no way in the world I'll ever finish it
That car is too fast
This beer is too cold
And watching all this football is sure getting old
Wish I was working this weekend
Not on the lake threading my line
Things that never cross a man's mind
Her lips are too red
Her skirt is too tight
Her legs are too long
And her heels are too high
Boy, she looks like the marrying kind
Things that never cross a man's mind
