He came to town like a midwinter storm
He rode through the fields, so handsome and strong
His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun
But all he had come for was havin' some fun
If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe
I'd been married long time ago

He brought disaster wherever he went
The hearts of the girls was to hell broken sent
They all ran away so nobody would know
And left only men 'cause of Cotton-Eyed Joe

Hold, hold me for a while
I know this won't last forever
So hold, hold me tonight
Before the morning takes you away
Hold, hold me for a while....
What's that sparkle in your eyes?
Is it tears that I see?
Oh tomorrow you are gone
So tomorrow I'm alone
Short moments of time
We have left to share our love
Hold, hold me for a while
I know this won't last forever
So hold, hold me tonight
Before the morning takes you away
We're in eachothers arms
Soon we're miles apart
Can you imagine how I'll miss
Your touch and your kiss?
Short moments of time
We have left to share our love
Hold, hold me for a while....
Hold, hold me now
From dusk, all night to dawn
Save, save me now
A short moment of time1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When daddy put the barbeque on maximum
And caught her favorite pet, a skunk whose name's Garth
Short after our pop was up far
Old pop in an oak, pop in an oak

Wish you were here, me oh my countryman
Wish you were here
Wish you were here, don't you know the snow is getting colder
And I miss you like hell
And I'm feeling blue
Wish you were here, me oh my countryman
Wish you were here
Wish you were here, don't you know the snow is getting colder
And I miss you like hell
And I'm feeling blue
I've got feelings for you, baby
Do you still feel the same
From the first time I laid my eyes on you
I felt joy of living
I saw heaven in your eyes, in your eyes
Wish you were here, me oh my countryman
Wish you were here
Wish you were here, don't you know the snow is getting colder
And I miss you like hell
And I'm feeling blue
I miss your laugh, I miss your smile
I miss everything about you
Every seconds like a minute
Every minute's like a day
When you're far away
Wish you were here
The storm is getting colder, baby
I wish you were here
Wish you were here
A battlefield of love and fear
And I wish you were here
I've got feelings for you, baby
From the first time I laid my eyes on you
Wish you were here, me oh my countryman
Wish you were here
Wish you were here, don't you know the snow is getting colder

Perfect lips and perfect eyes
A perky ass to match my thighs

One smile, shines brighter than a star in the night
One look, and I'm guessing you're tighter than tight
One love, is all I'm longing for

It's been a pretty long time, baby
But now, I'm back in town
It's time to leave your husband
Now you know that little clown
Last time we were seeing
Didn't you beg for more
It's OK with me as long
As you do it four on the floor
This is what I'm giving you, you'll get it all tonight
You will be my lover, but not my dead-end wife
I'll be harder than your husband, I'll be harder than your man
I'll hit you with my twenty inch until you can not stand
I'll be harder than your husband, I'll be harder than your man
I'll hit you with my twenty inch until you can not stand
I've missed the little North Pole
On the bottom of my twister
Here's the one-eyed-worm
Now you'll never be a sister
Well, it's time to leave now
You better walk her home
Don't forget you underwear
You look pretty stoned
This is what I'm giving you, you'll get it all tonight
You will be my lover, but not my dead-end wife
I'll be harder than your husband, I'll be harder than your man
I'll hit you with my twenty inch until you can not stand
I'll be harder than your husband, I'll be harder than your man
I'll hit you with my twenty inch until you can not stand
I'll be harder than your husband, I'll be harder than your man

Hey honey, where the hell is my shooter now?
You can call me honey, you can steal my money
You can try again and you can pray to Heaven
But I tell you, honey, like the sun is sunny
Baby, I won't put my shooter down
You can call me honey, you can steal my money
You can try again and you can pray to Heaven
But I tell you, honey, like the sun is sunny
Baby, I won't put my shooter down
Now, the man I love is a wanted man
With a price put on his head
Every deputy wants a tag on his toe
He's better off with me
So together, we can start a new
You can plow the field and I will make your stew
Come on, darling, settle down with me
Put your shooter down
You can call me honey, you can steal my money
You can try again and you can pray to Heaven
But I tell you, honey, like the sun is sunny
Baby, I won't put my shooter down
You can call me honey, you can steal my money
You can try again and you can pray to Heaven
But I tell you, honey, like the sun is sunny
Baby, I won't put my shooter down
Sometimes I think that the gun in your hand
Means more to you than me
But I know better, you are getting old
You will need a family
And then, on Sundays, we can go to church
Time for you to end your search
Here's your life, take a look at me
'Cause I will be your wife
You can call me honey, you can steal my money
You can try again and you can pray to Heaven
But I tell you, honey, like the sun is sunny
Baby, I won't put my shooter down
You can call me honey, you can steal my money
You can try again and you can pray to Heaven
But I tell you, honey, like the sun is sunny

Come to me, baby
No, don't tell me "maybe"
When we are married
Your shooter are gonna get burried

The devil went down to Georgia
He was looking for a soul to steal
And he was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And was willin' to make a deal
When he came upon a boy playing on a fiddle
And playin' it hot
And the devil jumped up on a hickory stump and said
"Boy let me tell you what:
I bet you didn't know it
But I'm a fiddle player too
And if you care to take a dare
I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you."
The boy said, "My name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet, your gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best that's ever been."
Johnny rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia
And the devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul
The devil opened up his case and he said
"I'll start this show."
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
Then a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this
When the devil finished Johnny said
"Well you're pretty good ol' son!
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done!"
Fire on the mountain, run boys run
Devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chickens in the breadpan, picking out dough
Granny does your dog bite? No, child, no
The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, "Devil, just come on back
If you ever wanna try again
I done told you once
You son-of-a-bitch
I'm the best that's ever been!"
He played:
Fire on the mountain, run boys run
Devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chickens in the breadpan, picking out dough
Granny does your dog bite? No, child, no...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

He came to town like a midwinter storm

His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun
But all he had come for was having some fun

"Mary Lou, Mary Lou
I can't go on living without you
Mary Lou, Mary Lou
I can't go on singing without you
Whooo!
Mary Lou (Mary Lou), Mary Lou (Mary Lou)
I can't go on living without you (without you)
Mary Lou (Mary Lou), Mary Lou (Mary Lou)
I can't go on singing without you (without you)
And you sleep all day and you drink all night
How can you ever have the time to be my lover, man
You play your games, play your games everyday
You never do the things that you say you'll do
You always make excuses, like Mr. Jones
You hide away, hide away everyday
Mary Lou (Mary Lou), Mary Lou (Mary Lou)
I can't go on living without you (without you)
Mary Lou (Mary Lou), Mary Lou (Mary Lou)
I can't go on singing without you (without you)
And you drink your whiskey like it's orange juice
And always swear at the cowboys near Johnson's farm
You fool around, fool around everyday
If you wanna be my man, you gotta quit your booze
Shave your butt, take a bath and stay home with me
Close to me, close to me everyday
I climb on the stage and the band begins to play them old country songs Everybody scream and shout while I show my balls
Mary Lou (Mary Lou), Mary Lou (Mary Lou)
I can't go on living without you (without you)
Mary Lou (Mary Lou), Mary Lou (Mary Lou)
I can't go on singing without you (without you)
I work so hard from 9 to 5
Singing out of tune
The rumours say you're desprate
You're banging with the boys
Mary Lou
Mary Lou
Mary Lou
Mary Lou
Mary Lou (Mary Lou), Mary Lou (Mary Lou)
I can't go on living without you (without you)
Mary Lou (Mary Lou), Mary Lou (Mary Lou)
I can't go on singing without you (without you)
Mary Lou
Mary Lou
I'd love to hold you in my arms again

The McKenzie brothers just reached their limits
It's now mid-August and two months have passed since the new marshall Mike Monroe came to town
He'd already put Joe and Jeramiha six feet under
They were drunk as the skunks, they were on their way back from the saloon
They past Steve Harlow's range to wrestle some cattle
The marshall and his deputies showed up and shot 'em in the neck. The most bloody fireworks Dog Head City had ever seen
Jim, the oldest brother and head of the clan since father Judas got his head blown of in a gunfight
Saddled up his horse and went in to town, just to set things straight with the marshall
On his way to town. he rode past his uncle Jock's to fill him in about Joe and Jeramiha
"Looks like the marshall wants a war and he's gonna get one", Jock said
"I'll send a message out for brother James, your uncle. Remember him? You met at the wedding when he stole your cousin Julia from the groom."
Meanwhile, in town, marshall Monroe and his deputies were drinking their heads off and shootin' run away chickens to celebrate the passing of the McKenzies
Next morning, the McKenzie clan were ready to set things straight with the marshall and his men
They sent little John into town to lure 'em out and into a trap, so they can shoot 'em dead
John came to town, walked into the saloon, saw the marshall eatin' lunch
Baked beans, sollie belly and a tun of brew
He saw his chance to be a man, he'd always been a little boy in the clan
He wiped his sweat of his hands and said "hey scumbag, this town ain't big enough for the two of us
You killed my two brothers and now, it's your time to kiss the dust. Get ready to slap leather."
But before John even cleared his holster, the marshall had filled him with so much lead
It took six strong men to carry him out. Mike Monroe finished his meal, reloaded his gun, gathered his men and said "it's time to finish the McKenzies once and for all."
The McKenzie brothers
May Hell be your home
The McKenzie brothers
The end of your terrordome

May Hell be your home

Have you heard the story of Bottleneck Bob
Tried to rob a train with cattle
He laid in ambush above the hills
Early Sunday morning
He blew the tracks to smithereens
With the biggest blast you've ever seen
And the cattle ran all over the place
And there was Bob with the longest face
Bottleneck Bob is riding fast
Wanted by the law for the freight train blast
The sheriff and his men is a big bad mob
And they're chasing poor old Bottleneck Bob
And the cattle ran back in to town
Where all was peace and quiet
But when the people saw the herd
They surely caused a riot
The cattle smashed the bank in flakes
Just like the worst of robbers
And the sheriff scratched his head and wondered
Where to put them all
Bottleneck Bob is riding fast
Wanted by the law for the freight train blast
The sheriff and his men is a big bad mob
And they're chasing poor old Bottleneck BobEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"I was working at the railroad
On the train to Arkansas
Last summer, I met a girl
She came from nowhere in Idaho
I can't get, no no no
Just can't get her
Out of my mind
Can't forget, no no no
Those bedroom eyes
And that little gracious smile
Howdy folks, this song's about a man and a woman, what else
You know, one minute everything's going fine
The next, it's gone with the wind
But what the hey, I still go my horse
I was working at the railroad
On the train to Arkansas
Last summer, I met a girl
She came from nowhere in, she came from nowhere in Idaho
I can't get, no no no
Just can't get her
Out of my mind
Can't forget, no no no
Those bedroom eyes
And that little gracious smile
Still, I wonder about her name
Guess she never told and I never asked
Like a Southern hurricane
She took me by surprise, then vanished in the haze
I can't get, no no no
I just can't get her
Out of my mind
Can't forget, no no no
Those bedroom eyes
And that little gracious smile
Can't forget, no no no
Those bedroom eyes
And that little gracious smile

Hmmm
Hmmm
Hmmm
Hmmm
Lightyears to be found, gaze out of my window
Want to feel what it is like to belong
Lead us right through the night
Help us find a place to call home
We are rolling home, we're rolling home
No more hearts to break, no more to roam
There's no one waiting, there's no one to say goodbye
So guided by a wanderin' star, we're rolling home
There's a silverline over the horizon
And it fades the dreams we've lost long time ago
You are near, there's no fear
Lost but not alone, going home
We are rolling home, we're rolling home
No more hearts to break, no more to roam
There's no one waiting, there's no one to say goodbye (say goodbye)
So guided by a wanderin' star, we're rolling homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
