I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face and I've
Never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe, it's washing over me
And suddenly, I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

In a way, I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
I'm closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now
'Cause I can feel you breathe, it's washing over me
And suddenly, I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe


Caught up in the touch
The slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Where are you Christmas
Why can't I find you
Why have you gone away
Where is the laughter
You used to bring me
Why can't I hear music play
My world is changing
I'm rearranging
Does that mean Christmas changes too
Where are you Christmas
Do you remember
The one you used to know
I'm not the same one
See what the time's done
Is that why you have let me go
Christmas is here
Everywhere, oh
Christmas is here
If you care, oh
If there is love in your heart and your mind
You will feel like Christmas all the time
I feel you Christmas
I know I've found you
You never fade away
The joy of Christmas
Stays here inside us
Fills each and every heart with love
Where are you Christmas
Fill your heart with love1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When I think back on these times
And the dreams we left behind
I'll be glad 'cause I was blessed to get
To have you in my life
When I look back on these days
I'll look and see your face
You were right there for me...

In my dreams, I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart, there will always be a place for you, for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am, there you'll be
And everywhere I am, there you'll be

Well, you showed me how it feels
To feel the sky within my reach
And I always will remember all
The strength you gave to me
Your love made me make it through
Oh, I owe so much to you
You were right there for me

In my dreams, I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart, there will always be a place for you, for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am, there you'll be
'Cause I always saw in you my light, my strength
And I wanna thank you now for all the ways
You were right there for me (You were right there for me)
You were right there for me
For always

In my dreams, I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart, there will always be a place for you, for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am, there you'll be
And everywhere I am, there you'll be

There you'll be...5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I don't want another heartbreak
I don't need another turn to cry, no
I don't wanna learn the hard way
Baby, hello
Oh no, goodbye
But you got me like a rocket
Shooting straight across the sky

It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, impossible
This kiss, this kiss
Unstoppable
This kiss, this kiss

Cinderella said to Snow White
"How does love get so off course, oh
All I wanted was a white knight
With a good heart
Soft touch, fast horse"
Ride me off into the sunset
Baby, I'm forever yours
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, unthinkable
This kiss, this kiss
Unsinkable

You can kiss me in the moonlight
On the rooftop under the sky, oh
You can kiss me with the windows open
While the rain comes pouring inside, oh
Kiss me in sweet slow motion
Let's let everything slide
You got me floating
You got me flying

It's the way you love me (The way)
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion (Ahh, ahh)

If I had just one tear running down your cheek
Maybe I could cope, maybe I'd get some sleep
If I had just one moment at your expense
Maybe all my misery would be well spent, yeah

Could you cry a little?
Lie just a little
Pretend that you're feeling a little more pain
I gave, now I'm wanting
Something in return
So cry just a little for me

If your love could be caged
Honey, I would hold the key
And conceal it underneath
The pile of lies you handed me
And you'd hunt those lies
They'd be all you'd ever find
And that'd be all you'd have to know
For me to be fine, yeah

Can you cry a little?
Die just a little

Give it up, baby

Dreaming all day
Of holding you
Touching you

You never looked so good
As you did last night
Underneath the city lights
There walking with your friend
Laughing at the moon
I swear you looked right through me
But I'm still living with your goodbye
And you're just going on with your life

How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye?
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all

You, I hear you're doing fine
Seems like you're doing well
As far as I can tell
Time (time) is leaving us behind (leaving us behind)
Another week has passed
And still I haven't laughed yet
So tell me what your secret is
(I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)
To letting go, letting go like you did, like you did
How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye?
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Ooh, like we never loved at all

Did you forget the magic?
Did you forget the passion? (Passion)
Did you ever miss me
Ever long to kiss me?
Oh, oh baby, baby (Oh, baby)

Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall

Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only man?
And didn't I give you everything
That a woman possibly can?
Each time I tell myself I think I've had enough
Well, I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough
So come on, come on, come on

And take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Take another little piece of my heart, I know you will
Break it
Break another little piece of my heart now, baby
'Cause you know you got it if it makes you feel good, so good

You're out on the street looking good
Baby, deep down in your heart you know that it ain't right
No, you'll never hear me crying
You know I cry all the time
Each time I tell myself that I can't stand the pain
You hold me in your arms and I start singing once again
So come on, come on, come on
And take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Take another little piece of my heart, I know you will

Baby, tell me where'd you ever learn
To fight without saying a word
Then waltz back into my life
Like it's all gonna be alright
Don't you know how much it hurts?

When we don't talk, when we don't touch
When it doesn't feel like we're even in love
It matters to me
When I don't know what to say, don't know what to do
Don't know if it really even matters to you
How can I make you see?
It matters to me

Maybe I still don't understand
The distance between a woman and a man
So tell me how far it is
And how you can love like this
'Cause I'm not sure I can

When we don't talk, when we don't touch
When it doesn't feel like we're even in love
It matters to me
When I don't know what to say, don't know what to do

Couple of guys, sitting around drinking
Down at the Starlight Bar
One of 'em says, "You know I've been thinking"
Other one says, "That won't get you too far"
He says, "This is your life, and welcome to it
It's just working and drinking and dreams
Ad on TV says "Just Do It"
Hell if I know what that means"

The secret of life is a good cup of coffee
The secret of life is keep your eye on the ball
The secret of life is a beautiful woman
And Marilyn stares down from the barroom wall

"You and me, we're just a couple of zeros
Just a couple of down-and-outs
But movie stars and football heroes
What have they got to be unhappy about?"
So they turn to the bartender, "Sam, what do you think?
What's the key that unlocks that door?"
Sam don't say nothing, just wipes off the bar
And he pours them a couple more
'Cause the secret of life is in Sam's martinis
The secret of life is in Marilyn's eyes
The secret of life is in Monday Night Football
Rolling Stones records and Mom's apple pie

Sam looks up from his Sunday paper
Says, "Boys, you're on the wrong track
The secret of life is there ain't no secret
And you don't get your money back"
Hey
The secret of life is getting up early
The secret of life is staying up late
The secret of life is try not to hurry
But don't wait
Don't wait

The secret of life is a good cup of coffee
The secret of life is keep your eye on the ball
The secret of life is to find the right woman
The secret of life is nothing at all
Oh, it's nothing at all

And her parents dreams went up in smoke

Heads I win, tails you lose
I always play by my own rules
And I don't believe in wasting time
So long before we end this night

I will have held you
I will have kissed you
I will have claimed you
You will be mine
I will have loved you
Wrong or right
I will have your heart
You will be mine

An unwritten law says a girl should wait
Should let the man set his own pace
But a woman in love, she's above the law
So long before this night is gone

I will have held you
I will have kissed you
I will have claimed you
You will be mine
I will have loved you
Wrong or right
I will have your heart
You will be mine
You top my list of things to do
And I will get close to you
Before this night is through

When the lights go down
He'll be filling a pan with a broom in his hand
In some dive across town
He'll be wiping the bar, and mopping the floor
Counting his tips, and locking the doors
Wrestling the Devil that tells him to pour another round
When the lights go down
She'll be calling her friends from her Mercedes Benz
But it's too late now
They were there for the fame, the flash, and the thrill
For the drop of the name, the parties, the pills
As another star falls from the Hollywood Hills without a sound

When the lights go down
And there's nothing left to be
When the lights go down
And the truth is all you see
When you feel that hole inside your soul
And wonder what you're made of
Well, we all find out
When the lights go down

When the lights go down
At the end of the day when this game that I play
Has gone another round
As I lay there alone on this big empty bed
With nothing but thoughts of you in my head
I think of the things that I wish I had said
When you were still around
When the lights go down and there's nothing left to be
When the lights go down and the truth is all you see
And I wonder if all my life's about
The sum of all my fears and all my doubts
When the lights go down
When the lights go down and there's nothing left to be
When the lights go down and the truth is all you see
When you feel that hole inside your soul
And wonder what you're made of
Well, we all find out

Well, it's a long way from Star, Mississippi
To the big stage I'm singing on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight

And some people seem to think that I've changed
That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
That I've really always been

They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from

Teenage girl, much too young
Unprepared for what's to come
A baby changes everything
Not a ring on her hand
All her dreams and all her plans
A baby changes everything
A baby changes everything
The man she loves, she's never touched
How will she keep his trust?
A baby changes everything
A baby changes everything
And she cries
Ooh, she cries
She has to leave, go far away
Heaven knows she can't stay
A baby changes everything
She can feel it's coming soon
There's no place, there's no room
A baby changes everything
A baby changes everything
And she cries
And she cries
Ooh she cries
Shepherds all gather around
Up above a star shines down
Choir of angels say
Glory to the newborn king
A baby changes everything

I must be crazy now
Maybe I dream too much
But when i think of you
I long to feel your touch
To whisper in your ear
Words that are old as time
Words only you would hear
If only you were mine
I wish i could go back to the very first day i saw you
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do
And you'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side

I love you
Please say you love me too
These three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

So today I finally find the courage deep inside
Just to walk right up to your door
But my body can't move when i finally get to it
Like a thousand times before
Then without a word, you handed me this letter
Read "I hope this finds the way into your heart", it said
"I love you
Please say you love me too
Till the end of time"

Well maybe I, I need a little love, yeah
Maybe I, I need a little care
Maybe you, maybe you need somebody just to hold you
If you do
Just reach out
I'll be there

I love you
Please say you love me
Please say you love me too
These three words, they could change our lives forever
And i promise you that we will always be together

Oh, I love you
Please say you love me
Please say you love me too

But I can't go a day without your face
Going through my mind

Passes without you in it

You put us behind, no matter how hard I try

Down a dead-end road
Let me let go, darling, won't you?

We said we'd walk together
Baby, come what may
Back from the twilight
Should we lose our way
As we were walking
A hand should slip free

Stay in stride

Soon we will wed
Should we lose each other
In the shadow of the evening trees
Oh, I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind
Wait for me
Darling, I'll wait for you
And should I fall behind
Wait for me

Wait for me
If I should fall behind
Wait for me
Wait for meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
