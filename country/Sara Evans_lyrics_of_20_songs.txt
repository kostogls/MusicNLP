She was in the backyard
They say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up
A white pick-up truck
Her folks shoulda seen it coming
It was only just a matter of time
Plenty old enough
And you can't stop love
She stuck a note on the screen door
"Sorry, but I got to go"
That was all she wrote
Her mama's heart was broke
That was all she wrote
Or so the story goes

Now her daddy's in the kitchen
Staring out the window
Scratching and a-racking his brains
How could 18 years just up and walk away?
Our little pony-tailed girl
Grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hanging out on the line
Now, don't you wonder
What the preacher's gonna preach about Sunday morning
Nothing quite like this has happened here before
Well, he must have been a looker
A smooth talking son of a gun
For such a grounded girl to just up and run
Course you can't fence time
And you can't stop love

Now all the biddies in the beauty shop gossip
Going non-stop
Sipping on pink lemonade
How could 18 years just up and walk away?
Our little pony-tailed girl
Grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line
Yee-hoo!


She's got her pretty little bare feet
Hanging out the window
And they're heading up to Vegas tonight
How could eighteen years just up and walk away?
Our little pony-tailed girl
Grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hanging out on the line
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hanging out on the line
She was in the backyard
They say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up
A white pickup truck
Plenty old enough
And you can't stop love
No, you can't fence time
And you can't stop loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I wish you were a pack of cigarettes
Cause you would of come with a warning
Before I let you steal my breath
I woulda known how bad you were for me

Some people lie
Some people trust
Some people hide
What they're made of

If you woulda been lit up like a marquee sign
Coulda saved myself some wasted time
From the minute I found you
If it’d been written out in black and white
Maybe then I would have told my mind
Not to get wrapped around you
I should have known it from the start
You were only here to break my heart
{Verse 2]
If you had just been tequila
I would've known when to stop
Woulda been so easy to leave ya
Never even woulda taken a shot
But people lie
And people trust
And people hide
What they're made of

If you woulda been lit up like a marquee sign
Coulda saved myself some wasted time
From the minute I found you
If it’d been written out in black and white
Maybe then i would have told my mind
Not to get wrapped around you
I should have known it from the start
You were only here to break my heart
Lit up like a marquee sign
Lit up like a marquee sign

If I could have seen right through ya
Known ya before I knew ya

If you woulda been lit up like a marquee sign
Coulda saved myself some wasted time
From the minute I found you
If it’d been written out in black and white
Maybe then i would have told my mind
Not to get wrapped around you
I should have known it from the start
You were only here to break my heart
Yeah, you were only here to break my heart
Lit up like a marquee sign
Woah, oh
Lit up like a marquee sign
Woah, oh
Lit up like a marquee sign
Woah, oh, hey

Woke up late today and I still feel the sting of the pain
But I brushed my teeth anyway
I got dressed through the mess and put a smile on my face
I got a little bit stronger

Riding in the car to work and I'm
Trying to ignore the hurt so I
Turned on the radio
Stupid song made me think of you
I listened to it for minute
But then I changed it
I'm getting a little bit stronger
Just a little bit stronger

And I'm done hoping
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
And, oh, I'm done thinking
You could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger
It doesn't happen overnight but you
Turn around and a month's gone by
And you realize you haven't cried
I'm not giving you a hour or a second or another minute longer
I'm busy getting stronger

And I'm done hoping
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
And, oh, I'm done thinking
You could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger

Getting along without you baby
I'm better off without you baby
How does it feel without me baby?
I'm getting stronger without you baby
And I'm done hoping
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
And, oh, I'm done thinking
You could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger

And just a little bit stronger
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit stronger
Get a little bit stronger2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I wanna call you up
But if I call you up I'm gonna hear your voice
And if I hear your voice
I'm gonna wanna give in and if I give in
I'm gonna get in my car
And if I get in my car I'm gonna come on over
But if I come over baby it's all over
One thing always leads to another

I don't trust myself
No oh oh
I don't trust myself
No oh oh

I wanna pour this wine
But if I pour this wine it's gonna go to my head
And if it goes to my head
I'm gonna think about you
And if i think about you it's gonna break my heart
And if it breaks my heart I'm gonna want you to hold me
So damn this heart put the cork in the bottle
One thing always leads to another
I don't trust myself
No oh oh
I don't trust myself
No oh oh
I don't trust myself
One thing always leads to another
One thing always leads to another

So maybe I'll just close my eyes
Maybe if I close my eyes

I'm gonna wanna call you up
But if I call you up I'm gonna hear your voice
And if I hear your voice I'm gonna wanna give in

I don't trust myself
No oh oh
I don't trust myself
No oh oh
Everything that I do leads me right back to you

There I was ten years old
Waiting in my room for him to come home
I just knew he'd be so mad
Though I begged my mother not to, she told my dad
There was no denying I let him down
But instead of being angry
He put his arms around me and said

In the sunlight or the rain, brightest nights or darkest days
I'll always feel the same way
Whatever road you may be on
Know you're never too far gone my love is there wherever you may be
Just remember that you will always be my baby

There I was twenty one
Oh I was so ashamed of what I'd done
On a country road
Parked one night
What started out so innocent
Crossed the line
There was no denying
I let God down
But instead of being angry
He let his love surround me and I heard
In the sunlight or the rain, brightest nights or darkest days
I'll always feel the same way
Whatever road you may be on
Know you're never too far gone my love is there wherever you may be
Just remember that you will always be my baby

There he is my little man
I'm sure he'll get in trouble every now and then
And I pray to God that when he does
I'll be just as understanding as my father was
Cause the last thing that I want to do is let him down
So instead of being angry
I'm gonna throw my arms around him and I'll say

In the sunlight or the rain, brightest nights or darkest days
I'll always feel the same way
Whatever road you may be on
Know you're never too far gone my love is there wherever you may be
Just remember that you will always be my babyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Words, like "hey, nice to meet you"
Got us walking down the street to grab a drink
And words, like "Tell me 'bout your family"
Got us falling, got us landing in a tree
Oh and words, took us all the way from kissin'
In a park and lot to missin
Everything we used to be

Say the words and ill be gone
Turn our perfect lights into another sad song
I won't keep you here
Keep holding on to what we were
Just say the words

Words, well they sure are confusin'
Like when we started using them
Just bullets in a fight
Oh and words, like "Did you ever love me?"
Well they pushed you and they shoved me to the edge of goodbye

Just say the words and ill be gone
Turn our perfect lights to another sad song
I won't keep you here
Keep holding on to what we were
Just say the words
Like bitter poison drippin' off your tongue
Pour the thread and watch the story come undone

Just say the words and ill be gone
Turn our perfect lights to another sad song
I won't keep you here
Keep holding on to what we were
Just say the words

Maybe words, like "I'm sorry and I need you"
Would have been enough to keep you from walking out
Is it too late to say 'em now?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Lying here with you
Listening to the rain
Smiling just to see
The smile upon your face

These are the moments I thank God that I'm alive
These are the moments I'll remember all my life

And I could not ask for more

Looking in your eyes
Seeing all I need
Everything you are

It's here when I wake up
Every single morning
Follows me downstairs
In the paper on the wall
In the plaster on the ceiling
Every single drop of air that I'm breathing

What am I supposed to do with?
What am I supposed to do?

With all the love you left me
All the love you left me
It can't hold me, it don't kiss me
But in these sheets, it lays down with me
All the love you left me
You left me, left me, left me, left me
You left me, left me, left me, left me

Can't wash it off like makeup
Leave it in the closet
Like a dress out of style
Can't light it up and burn it
Box it up and send it
Like the shirt, you left behind
What am I supposed to do with?
What am I supposed to do with?

All the love you left me
Yeah, all the love you left me
It can't hold me, it don't kiss me
But in these sheets, it lays down with me

Wasn't I brushing the hair from your face
Wasn't I just drying your tears and singing you sweet dreams at night
Seems like it was just yesterday
Suddenly you're seventeen
And it's just eighteen months till goodbye

I'd rather deny it
And God knows I've tried
I could keep you here at home
But I know

Loving you is holding you
And lifting you up
And planting the seeds and then watching you grow
And even though it's hard to do
It's letting you fall
And giving you wings so you fly on your own
'Cause part of loving you is letting you go

All of your life I've prepared you to leave
Now that little boys all grown up
And it's too late for changing your mind
Nobody ever warned me that the years go too fast
And there's just no pressing rewind
'Cause time is a liar
Wish I could set the clock on fire
Turn it back to yesterday
But it just keeps ticking away

Loving you is holding you
And lifting you up
And planting the seeds and then watching you grow
And even though it's hard to do
It's letting you fall
And giving you wings so you fly on your own
'Cause part of loving you is letting you go
No matter how I wanna make you stay
You were also born to fly away
Loving you is holding you
And lifting you up
And planting the seeds and then watching you grow
And even though it's hard to do
It's letting you fall
And giving you wings so you fly on your own
'Cause part of loving you is letting you go

I know your eyes are burning
But try and hold it in
Don't let him see you crying
Don't give that much to him
Don't tell him that you love him
Or that you're sorry one more time
Or get on your knees, beg and plead
Trying to change his mind

If he's gonna go, let him go
If he wants to leave, let him leave
If he's gonna walk, he's gonna walk
He'll only leave you better off

So go on and get that suitcase
And help him pack it up
Girl, you ain't losing nothing
You don't need his kind of love
Don't watch him as he's going
It'll break your heart again
And don't stand there waiting
With the door wide open
Hoping he'll walk back in
If he's gonna go, let him go
If he wants to leave, let him leave
If he's gonna walk, he's gonna walk
He'll only leave you better off

You're gonna find someone who'll love you like he should have
And when you finally feel the difference you'll be so glad
You gave yourself the chance to move on
You'll wonder why it took you so long
And why you wasted so much time on him

If he's gonna go, let him go
If he wants to leave, let him leave
If he's gonna walk, he's gonna walk
He'll only leave you better off1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I've been tellin' my dreams to the scarecrow
About the places that I'd like to see
I said, "Friend, do you think I'll ever get there?"
Oh, but he just stands there smilin' back at me
So I confessed my sins to the preacher
About the love I've been prayin' to find
"Is there a brown eyed boy in my future?" Yeah
An' he says, "Girl, you've got nothin' but time"

But how do you wait for heaven?
And who has that much time?
And how do you keep your feet on the ground when you know
That you were born
You were born to fly?

My daddy, he is grounded like the oak tree
My momma, she is steady as the sun
Oh, you know I love my folks, but I keep starin' down the road
Just lookin' for my one chance to run
Hey, 'cause I will soar away like the blackbird
I will blow in the wind like a seed
I will plant my heart in the garden of my dreams
And I will grow up where I'll wandered wild and free
Oh, how do you wait for heaven?
And who has that much time?
And how do you keep your feet on the ground when you know
That you were born
You were born, yeah
You were born to fly?

So how do you wait for heaven?

Thank you for the roses that you sent me
They're beautiful
And you asked me to think of you
You know I will
Your note just said "I'm sorry, please forgive me"
I always do, but I have to let you know the way I feel

I left you this message so you'd know
Sometimes loving me just means leaving me alone
So please don't call every time you think of me
'Cause I need some time alone to kill this pain
You should know that I don't give up easily
But sometimes for things to grow, they need some rain
And sometimes loving me just means leaving me alone

I left you this message so you'd know
To not come by every time you miss me

I thought you were sent from heaven
You had me floating on a cloud
But tonight, my sky is falling
It's a long way down, it's a long way down
Now you can't lie
Cause boy, I caught you
You can't deny you've been messin' around
Where you goin?
Boy, there ain't no ice water
It's a long way down, it's a long way down

So far down, that it ain't got a bottom
Thought you had wings, but you ain't got 'em
Falling angel, don't look down, it;s a long way down

Don't look to me to be your savior
We both know where your soul is bound
In his south, just like the love you gave me
It's a long way down, oh, it's a long way down

Yeah, so far down, that it ain't got a bottom
Thought you had wings, but you ain't got 'em
Falling angel, don't look down, oh, it;s a long way down

I can't imagine, any greater fear
Than wakin' up, without you here
And though the sun would still shine on
My whole world, would all be gone
But not for long

If I had to run, if I had to crawl
If I had to swim a hundred rivers, just to climb a thousand walls
Always know that I would find a way, to get to where you are
There's no place that far

It wouldn't matter why we're apart
Lonely miles or two stubborn hearts
Nothin' short of God above
Could turn me away from your love

Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost and what you had and what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know

Now here I go again, you see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost and what you had and what you lost
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go

You got to stay away from me
