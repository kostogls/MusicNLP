Standin' on the corner, I didn't mean no harm
Along come a police, he took me by the arm
It was down in Memphis, corner of Beale and Main
He says, "Big boy, you'll have to tell me your name"

Dee-oh-dee-lay-ee, eh-ee, oh-dee-lay-ee

I said, "You'll find my name on the tail of my shirt
I'm a Tennessee hustler, I don't have to work"
So listen all you rounders, you better leave my women alone
'Cause I'll take my Special and run all you rounders home

Dee-oh-dee-lay-ee, eh-ee, oh-dee-lay-ee

My good gal loves me, everybody knows
And she paid a hundred cash dollars just for me, a suit of clothes
She come to the joint, a forty-four in each hand
She said, "Stand aside, all you women and men, 'cause I'm looking for my man"

I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob
Who used to steal, gamble and rob
He thought he was the smartest guy in town
But I found out last Monday
That Bob got locked up Sunday
They've got him in the jailhouse way downtown

He's in the jailhouse now, he's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice
To quit playing cards and shooting dice
He's in the jailhouse now
Oh-lay-ee-ee-ee, oh-dee-oh-dee-ee-ee
Ah-dee-oh-lay-ee-ee-dee-del-ee-dee, oh-lay-ee

He played a game called poker
Pinochle, Whist and Euchre
But shooting dice was his greatest game
Now he's downtown in jail
Nobody to go his bail
The judge done said that he refused the fine

He's in the jailhouse now, he's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice
To quit playing cards and shooting dice
He's in the jailhouse now
Ah-dee-oh-lay-ee-ee-ee, ah-dee-oh-lay-ee-ee-ee
Ah-dee-oh-lay-ee-ee-dee-del-ee-dee, oh-lay-ee
I went out last Tuesday
Met a girl named Susie
I told her I was the swellest man around
We started to spend my money
Then she started to call me honey
We took in every cabaret in town
We're in the jailhouse now, we're in the jailhouse now
I told the judge right to his face
We didn't like to see this place
We're in the jailhouse now

All around the water tank
Waiting for a train
A thousand miles away from home
Sleeping in the rain
I walked up to a brakeman
To give him a line of talk
He says, "If you've got money
I'll see that you don't walk"
I haven't got a nickel
Not a penny can I shill
"Get off, get off, you railroad bum"
He slammed the boxcar door

Oh-de-lay-ee, ay-ee, oh-lay-ee

He put me off in Texas
A state I dearly love
The wide open spaces all around me
The moon and stars up above
Nobody seems to want me
Or lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco
I'm going back to Dixieland
Though my pocketbook is empty
And my heart is full of pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home
Just waiting for a train

Frankie and Johnny was sweethearts, oh Lord how they did love
Swore to be true to each other, true as the stars above
He was her man, he wouldn't do her wrong
Frankie went down to the corner, just for a bucket of beer
She says, Mr Bartender has my loving Johnny been here
He's my man, he wouldn't do me wrong
I don't want cause you no trouble, I ain't gonna tell you no lie
I saw your lover an hour ago with a gal named Nellie Bligh
He was your man, but he's doing you wrong
Frankie looked over the transom, she saw to her surprise
There on a cot sat Johnny, making love to Nellie Bligh
He is my man, and he's doing me wrong
Frankie drew back her kimono, she took out a little 44
Rooty toot toot, three times she shot, right through that hardwood door
Shot her man, he was doing her wrong
Bring out the rubber tied buggy, bring out the rubber tied hack
I'm taking my man to the graveyard, but I ain't gonna bring him back
Lord, he was my man, and he done me wrong
Bring out a thousand policemen, bring 'em around today
To lock me down in the dungeon cell, and throw that key away
I shot my man, he was doing me wrong
Frankie she said to the warden what are they going to do
The warden he said to Frankie, it's electric chair for you
Cause you shot your man, he was doing you wrong
This story has no moral, this story has no end
This story just goes to show, that there ain't no good in men
He was her man, and he done her wrong1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm growing tired of the big city lights
Tired of the glamor and tired of the sights
In all my dreams I am roaming once more
Back to my home on that old river shore

I am sad and weary far away from home
Miss the Mississippi and you, dear
Days are dark and dreary and everywhere I roam
Miss the Mississippi and you

Roaming the wide world over
Always alone and blue, so blue
Nothing seems to cheer me under heaven's dome
Miss the Mississippi and you

Miss the Mississippi and you
Mockingbirds are singing 'round the cabin door
Miss the Mississippi and you
Roaming the wide world over
Always alone and blue, so blue
Longing for my homeland, muddy water shore

Underneath the Ozark moon

I hope they don't get me
For I've got a sweetie waiting
For me down in Tennessee

There's where we'll pick a little cabin
And call it our mountain home

Hoho-heyhey, the gamblin' bar room blues
I went down to the corner just to meet my ga,l
I found her standin' on the sidewalk talkin' to my pal
I stroke back to the bar room to get another drink of gin
But the first thing I knew I was reelin', rockin' and drunk a gin
I kept drinkin' gin and liquor 'till way ...
When my pal walked into the bar room we had an awful fight
I reached down for my razor, and then we knocked around
But when I pulled my pistol I quickly smoked him down
Heyhee-heyho, ho-hoohoo
Hoo-oo-hoo-oo, hoo-ho, ho-hey-ho
I went down to see my baby, and met her on the way
I told her I'd have to leave her, I told her I could not stay
I started down to the station and stopped in at the bar
There I met a policeman ridin' in a motor car
We both drank lots of liquor, that flatfooted cop and I
I thought he would never leave me, Lord, I thought I die
My baby came in to join us, and then it began to rain
Then I had to hurry-hurry to catch that midnight train
I laid my head in the bar room door, I 'll never get drunk anymore
I pawn my watch and my golden chain, I pawn my baby's diamond ring
Police, police, police, you're just as drunk as me
I'll grab that old eight-wheeler and make for the deep blue seaEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm goin' to California where they sleep out every night
I'm goin' to California where they sleep out every night
I'm leaving you, mama 'cause you know you don't treat me right


Listen to me, mama while I sing you this song
Listen to your daddy sing you this lonesome song
You got me worried now but I won't be worried long


Let me tell you somethin' mama, that you don't know
Let me tell you somethin' good gal, that you don't know
I'm a do right papa and got a home everywhere I go


Got the California blues and I'm sure gonna leave you here, Lord, Lord
Got the California blues and I'm sure gonna leave you here
I may ride the blind, I ain't got no railroad fare

I can't understand how come you treat me like you do do-do-do
Now if you don't want me mama, it's a cinch I don't want you

I had a home out in Texas
Down where the bluebonnets grew
I had the kindest old mother
How happy we were just we two
'Til one day the angels called her
That debt we all have to pay
She called me close to her bedside
These last few words to say

Son don't start drinking and gambling
Promise you'll always go straight
Ten years have passed since that parting
That promise I've broke I must say
I started gambling for pastime
At last I was just like them all
I bet my clothes and my money
Not dreaming that I'd ever fall

One night I bet all my money
Nothing was left to be seen
And all that I needed to break them
Was one card and that was a queen
The cards were dealt all round the table
Each man took a card on the draw
I drew the one that would beat them
I turned it and here's what I saw
I saw my mother's picture
And somehow she seemed to say
Son you have broken your promise
So I tossed the cards away
My winnings I gave to a newsboy
I knew I was wrong from the start
And I'll never forget that promise
To my Mother the queen of my heart

Hobo Billy

Riding on the eastbound freight train speeding through the night
Hobo Bill, a railroad bum, was fighting for his life
The sadness of his eyes revealed the torture of his soul
He raised a weak and weary hand to brush away the coal

Hobo Billy

No warm lights flickered around him, no blankets there to fold
Nothing but the howling wind the driving rain so cold
When he heard a whistle blowing in a dreamy kind of way
The hobo seemed contented for he smiled there where he lay

Hobo Bill

Outside the rain was falling on that lonely boxcar door
But the little form of Hobo Bill lay still upon the floor
While the train sped through the darkness and the raging storm outside
No one knew that Hobo Bill was taking his last ride
*Train Whistle*

It was early in the morning when they raised the hobo's head
The smile still lingered on his face but Hobo Bill was dead
There was no mother's longing to soothe his weary soul
For he was just a railroad bum who died out in the cold

I'm a pistol packin' papa
And when I walk down the street
You can hear those mamas shoutin'
Don't turn your gun on me
Now girls, I'm just a good guy
And I'm going to have my fun
And if you don't wanna smell my smoke
Don't monkey with my gun
Like a hobo when he's hungry
Like a drunk man when he's full
I'm a pistol packin' papa
I know how to shoot the bull
The hold-up men all know me
And they sure leave me be
I'm a pistol packin' papa
And I ramble where I please
When I have that funny feeling
That lorrying rambler's call
I swing aboard some freight train
And I shoot my pistol off
Sometimes one shot will do me
Sometime takes four or five
Sometimes I shoot all around
Before I'm satisfied
When you hear my pistol poppin'
You better hide yourself someplace
'Cause I ain't made for stoppin'
And I come from a shootin' race
My sweetheart understands me
She says I am her big shot
I'm her pistol packin' daddy
And I know I've got the drop
You can hear my new sport roadster
You can take my hardboil hat
But you can't never take from me
My silver-mounted gat
I'm a pistol packin' papa
I'm going to have my fun
Just follow me and you will hear
The barking of my gunEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My father is a drunkard my mother she is dead
And I am just an orphan child no place to lay my head
All through this world I wander they drive me from their door
Someday I'll find a welcome on heaven's golden shore

Now if to me you'll listen I'll tell a story sad
How drinking rum and the gambling hell have stole away my dad
My mother she is in heaven where God and the angels smile
And now I know she's watching her lonely orphan child


We were once so happy and had a happy home
Till daddy went to drinking rum and then he gambled some
He left my darling mother she died of a broken heart
And as I tell my story I can see your teardrops start

Don't weep for me and mother although I know it is sad
But try to find someone to cheer and save my poor lonely dad
I'm awful cold and hungry she closed her eyes and sighed
Then those who heard her story knew the orphan child had died

But one day I thought I'd settle down
I met a perfect lady she said she'd be my baby
We built a cottage in the old hometown
But somehow I can't forget my good old rambling days
The railroad trains are calling me away
I may be rough I may be wild I may be tough and countrified
But I can't give up my good old rough and rowdy ways
Sometimes I meet a bounder who knew me when I was a rounder

With friends around and even pals that I know are true
Still I'm lonely, homesick and blue
There's no one who can cheer me when I'm alone
Longing for my Mississippi home
Way down in the delta on that Mississippi shore
In that muddy water, I long to be once more
When night shadows creep about and the whippoorwill call
You can hear old mammy shout, "Come in here, you all"
Way down on the levee, strolling in the pale moon light
You can see those steamboats and the fields of snowy white
That's a feeling I can't lose that muddy water in my shoes
When I get that Mississippi Delta blues
I long to hear them talk and sing those old melodies
Swanee River and Ol' Black Joe
That sweet magnolia perfume floating on the breeze
Way down south is where I long to go
Way down in the delta on that Mississippi shore
In that muddy water, I long to be once more
When night shadows creep about and the whippoorwill call
You can hear old mammy shout, "Come in here, you all"
