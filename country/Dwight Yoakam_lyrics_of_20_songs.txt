Maybe someday I'll be strong
Maybe it won't be long
I'll be the one who's tough
You'll be the one who's got it rough
It won't be long and
Maybe I'll be real strong

Maybe I'll do things right
Maybe I'll start tonight
You'll learn to cry like me
Baby let's just wait and see
Maybe I'll start tonight
And do things right

You'll control me
And oh so boldly
Rule me 'til I'm free
'Til the pain that shakes me
Finally makes me
Get up off of my knees
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Maybe I'll be as fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts too
But I think that you'll slow down
When your turn to hurt comes around
Maybe I'll break hearts
And be as fast as you
Uhhh

You'll control me
And oh so boldly
Rule me 'til I'm free
'Til the pain that shakes me
Finally makes me
Get up off of my knees
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Maybe I'll be as fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts too
But I think that you'll slow down
When your turn to hurt comes around
Maybe I'll break hearts
And be as fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts
And be as fast as you
Ah, sookie

Maybe someday I'll be strong
Maybe it won't be long
I'll be the one who's strong
You'll be the one gonna cry
You're gonna cry like me
We'll just, uh, wait and see
Maybe I'll be as fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts tooEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Girl you taught me how to hurt real bad and cry myself to sleep
And showed me how this town can shatter dreams
Another lesson 'bout a naive fool who came to Babylon
And found out that the pie don't taste so sweet

Now it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on

Ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives
Painful scars are all that's left of me
Oh, but thank you girl for teachin' me brand new ways to be cruel
If I can find my mind now I guess I'll just leave

And it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on
Oh it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on
It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on
It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Runway Four, Flight 209
Teardrop falls, we start to climb
This window seat proved a poor choice
It shows the dream that's been destroyed
A little baby starts to cry
Hey, I would too, if not for pride
I owe so much to pride, it's true
It brought an end to me and you
Chorus:
But if I could, I'd turn around
Set my feet back on the ground
'Cause all this plane ride holds for me
Is a thousand miles of misery
--- Instrumental ---
I hear the engines, watch the clouds
The whole damn world looks distant now
But I can't seem to put no space
Between my cold heart and your sweet face
Across the aisle they're holding hands
Revealing brand new wedding bands
But our sweet gold, it's gone to rust
Now my life has turned to dust
Chorus:
But if I could, I'd turn around
Set my feet back on the ground
'Cause all this plane ride holds for me
Is a thousand miles of misery
All this plane ride holds for me
Is a thousand miles of misery...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be

I got heartaches in my pocket
I got echoes in my head
And all that I keep hearing
Are the cruel, cruel things that you said

I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be

Oh, I...
Oh, I...
Oh, I...
Oh, I...
Oh, I...
Oh, I...
I've got bruises on my memory
I've got tear stains on my hands
And in the mirror, there's a vision
Of what used to be a man

I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be

Oh, I...

I sang Dixie, as he died
But people just walked on by, as I cried
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride
So I sang Dixie, as he died

He said, "Way down yonder in the land of cotton
Old times there ain't near as rotten as they are
On this damned old L.A. street"
Then he drew a dying breath
And laid his head against my chest
Please, Lord, take his soul back home to Dixie

And I sang Dixie, as he died
But people just walked on by, as I cried
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride
So I sang Dixie, as he died


He said, "Listen to me, son, while you still can
Run back home to that Southern land
Don't you see, what life here has done to me"
Then he closed those old blue eyes
And fell limp, against my side
No more pain, and now he's safe back home in Dixie
And I sang Dixie, as he died
But people just walked on by, as I cried
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride
So I sang Dixie, as he died

I sang Dixie, as he diedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You keep calling me on the telephone
You say you're all alone, well that's real sad
And you keep leaving notes stuck on my door
Guess you're hungry for some more, girl that's too bad

'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet

Once there was this spider in my bed
I got caught up in her web of love and lies
She spun her chains around my heart and soul
Never to let go, oh, but I survived

'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet

Nothin' left you can do to try and bring me 'round
'Cause everything you do just brings me down, whoa
I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet
After what you put me through
Oh, I ain't that lonely yet
'Cause I ain't that lonely yet
No, I ain't that lonely yet

Would become so estranged"

You're the one
You're the one
That made me cry
You're the one
That laughed at me
Then said goodbye
You're the one
You're the one
That made me blue
So how's it feel
Now that you're the one
It's happened to

Now you're back calling me with open arms
What happened to the one you met with all that charm
You say he's gone
And you're alone
Well that's a shame
But if you think real hard
I know you'll see
Just who's to blame

You're the one
You're the one
That made me cry
You're the one
That laughed at me
Then said goodbye
You're the one
You're the one
That made me blue
So how's it feel
Now that you're the one
It's happened to
You're begging me to think about the love we shared
Yet it seems to me not too long ago you didn't care
The love you left
No longer lives
Within my heart
The game you played
So recklessly
Tore it all apart

You're the one
You're the one
That made me cry
You're the one
That laughed at me
Then said goodbye
You're the one
You're the one
That made me blue
So how's it feel
Now that you're the one

Oh tell me how's it feel now that you're the one
How's it feel to be the one
How's it feel now that you're the one it's happenin' toEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Pretty horses are what I have to ride
Lonely memories are where I go to hide
Empty pages are all I choose to write
But I love, I love
But I love, I love, I love
Broken windows are what I look through
Softly searching for small signs of me and you
Gently thinking of what's left that we could do
About our love, our love
About our love, our love, about our love
About our love, our love
About our love, our love, about our love
Pretty horses are still hard to ride
With each other we will find a place to hide
All the pages are still there to write
I love our love, But our love, our loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well I'm back again for another night
Of trying to break free from this sadness that I can't lay to rest
This old honky-tonk sure does feel like home
And the music with the laughter seem to soothe my loneliness
Turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
From the memory that's driving me lonely, crazy and blue
It helps me forget her, so the louder the better
Hey mister turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
If a tear should fall, if I should whisper her name
To some stranger I'm holdin' while we're dancin' to an old Buck Owens song
I know she won't mind, she won't even know
She'll be dancing with a memory crying teardrops of her own
Turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
From the memory that's driving me lonely, crazy and blue
It helps me forget her so the louder the better
Hey mister turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
Turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
From the memory that's driving me lonely, crazy and blue
It helps me forget her so the louder the better
Hey mister turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
Yeah, mister turn it on, turn it up, turn me looseEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I came here looking for something
I couldn't find anywhere else
Hey, I'm not trying to be nobody
I just want a chance to be myself
I've spent a thousand miles a-thumbin'
Yes, I've worn blisters on my heels
Trying to find me something better
Here on the streets of Bakersfield
Hey, you don't know me, but you don't like me
You say you care less how I feel
But how many of you that sit and judge me
Ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?
Spent sometime in San Francisco
I spent a night there in the can
They threw this drunk man in my jail cell
I took fifteen dollars from that man
Left him my watch and my old house key
Don't want folks thinkin' that I'd steal
Then I thanked him as I was leaving
And I headed out for Bakersfield
Hey, you don't know me, but you don't like me
You say you care less how I feel
But how many of you that sit and judge me
Ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?
Hey, you don't know me, but you don't like me
You say you care less how I feel
But how many of you that sit and judge me
Ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?
How many of you that sit and judge me

Well I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home
Well now I'm living wild and dangerously
But I've got plenty of company
When the moon comes up and the sun goes down
Well I can't wait to see the lights of town
'Cause I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home
Well, I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop

But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home
Hey now, a pretty little girl and a jug of wine
Well that's what it takes to make a honky tonk time
With the juke box moaning those honky tonk sounds
Well I can't wait to lay my money down
'Cause I'm a honky tonk man and I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old juke box

Thursday came and went without a reason
But that's the kind of thing that Thursdays will often do
I went to bed knowin' better, then woke up believin'
That I only had Friday to get through

Friday's never long, it feels real easy
'Til Saturday winds up just Friday's fool
Then Sunday left to hope, almost decievin'
Me about how I was over you

Then here came Monday and I remembered how that hurt can feel
The pain goes on and on, it gets really real
Then here came Monday and I remembered where it all went
It looked like I was doin' fine until Monday came along

Then here came Monday and I remembered how that hurt can feel
The pain goes on and on, it gets really real

We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, Baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I'm saying?
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds
So, if an old friend I know
Drops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again
Asking where I've been
Can't you see these tears are real
I'm crying
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds...
Oh, let our love survive
I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
Honey, you know
I've never lied to you
No-o, Never lied to you
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, Baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I'm saying?
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, Baby

Night wolves moan
Winter hills are black
I'm all alone
Sitting in the back
Of a long white Cadillac
Train whistle cries
Lost on its own track
I close my eyes
Sitting in the back
Of a long white Cadillac
Sometimes I blame it on a woman
The one that made my poor heart bleed
Sometimes I blame it on the money
Sometimes I blame it all on me
Headlights shine
Highway fades to black
It's my last ride
Sitting in the back
Of a long white Cadillac
Sometimes I blame it on a woman
The one that made my poor heart bleed
Sometimes I blame it on the money
Sometimes I blame it all on me
Train whistle cries
Lost on its own track
I close my eyes
I ain't never coming back
In a long white Cadillac
In a long white Cadillac
In a long white Cadillac
In a long white Cadillac
In a long white Cadillac
Ah, bye bye baby...

I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted to one time to see you laughing
I only wanted to see you
Laughing in the purple rain

Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you
Bathing in the purple rain

I never wanted to be your weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind of friend
Baby, I could never steal you from another
It's such a shame our friendship had to end

Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you
Bathing in the purple rain
Honey, I know, I know
I know times are changing
It's time we all reach out
For something new, that means you too
You say you want a leader
But you can't seem to make up your mind
I think you better close it
And let me guide you to the purple rain

When you give it up for gone
But your still diggin in the mine
And your starin out the window
Sayin everything will be just fine
Keepin with the whole affair
Every word seems outta line
No matter what angle you get
It's polish till it shine
Chorus:
So take a guess, where I stand
Pick a number, one to two
Take a look at the back of your hand
Just like ya know it, ya know me too
When ya say "Who the hell am I living with
What just went down?
Where did this come from, why are all my colors faded brown?
When did he change? What's with the rage?
Who's the dude with the extra role?
What's the verse, the line, the chapter, the page?"
Chorus
You think your lost without anyplace left to go
Like you need, one of those kisses, long and slow
First glance is not what it seems but theres some things that I just know
Like you take two sugars with a splash of cream

Yeah, like ya know it, you know me too
Just like ya know it, ya know me tooEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She said when I trusted love I dreamed in color too
But memories turn black and white, at least mine do…
She said my brother, you know, he used to have this friend…
But this is now and that was then

It’s better off just not to start
Than to have to watch us fall apart
All because of my second hand heart

I said if you could count up memories but only keep the best
You may not see how good they were without the rest
She said look I tried a lot
But I guess love it don’t like me
Oh and by the way, all those tries?
Sure didn’t come for free

So it’s better off just not to start
Than to have to watch us fall apart
All because of my second hand heart

Second hand hearts
Second hand hearts
Second hand hearts
Second hand hearts
Are not just for parts
So I’ll take away your sad luck baby
And you’ll change mine
When hurt starts talkin’ we’ll say hey, ya know, we ain’t got time
Then pick up all those small hopes back off the ground
’Cause after years of tears it’s hard to say what’s up or down

So if you will, I’ll try to start
And take the chance that we might fall apart
To try and save our second hand hearts
She said when I trusted love I dreamed in color too…2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Inside the pocket of a clown
Is a sad place to hang around
Just watching smiles turn into frowns
Inside the pocket of a clown
Inside the heartache of a fool
You'll learn things they don't teach in school
And lessons there can be real cruel
Inside the heartache of a fool
Hollow lies, make a thin disguise
As little drops of truth fall from your eyes
Hollow lies, make a thin disguise
As little drops of truth fall from your eyes
Inside a memory from the past
Lives every love that didn't last
Sweet dreams can start to fade real fast
Inside a memory from the past
It's a real sad place to hang around
Inside the pocket of a clownEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Chorus:
They learned readin', writin', Route 23
To the jobs that lay waiting in those cities' factories
They learned readin', writin', roads to the north
To the luxury and comfort a coal miner can't afford
They thought readin', writin', Route 23
Would take them to the good life that they had never seen
They didn't know that old highway
Could lead them to a world of misery
Have you ever been down Kentucky-way
Say south of Prestonburg
Have you ever been up in a holler
Have you ever heard
A mountain man cough his life away
From diggin' that black coal
In those dark mines, those dark mines
If you had you might just understand
The reason that they left it all behind
Chorus:
They learned readin', writin', Route 23
To the jobs that lay waitin' in those cities' factories
They learned readin', writin', roads to the north
To the luxury and comfort a coal miner can't afford
They thought readin', writin', Route 23
Would take them to the good life that they had never seen
They didn't know that old highway
Could lead them to a world of misery
Have you ever seen 'em
Put the kids in the car after work on Friday night
Pull up in a holler about 2 a.m
And see a light still shinin' bright
Those mountain folks sat up that late
Just to hold those little grandkids
In their arms, in their arms
And I'm proud to say that I've been blessed
And touched by their sweet hillbilly charm
Chorus:
They learned readin', writin', Route 23
To the jobs that lay waiting in those cities' factories
They learned readin', writin', roads to the north
To the luxury and comfort a coal miner can't afford

Would take them to the good life that they had never seen
They didn't know that old highway
Could lead them to a world of misery
Yeah, it turns out that that old highway
Leads you to a world of misery
They found out that that old highway
Leads you to a world of misery...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
