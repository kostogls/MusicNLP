The older I get
The more I think
You only get a minute, better live while you’re in it
'Cause it’s gone in a blink
And the older I get
The truer it is
It’s the people you love, not the money and stuff
That makes you rich

And if they found a fountain of youth
I wouldn’t drink a drop and that’s the truth
Funny how it feels I’m just getting to my best years yet

The older I get
The fewer friends I have
But you don’t need a lot when the ones that you got
Have always got your back
And the older I get
The better I am
At knowing when to give
And when to just not give a damn

And if they found a fountain of youth
I wouldn’t drink a drop and that’s the truth
Funny how it feels I’m just getting to my best years yet
The older I get

And I don’t mind all the lines
From all the times I’ve laughed and cried
Souvenirs and little signs of the life I’ve lived

The older I get
The longer I pray
I don’t know why, I guess that I've
Got more to say
And the older I get
The more thankful I feel
For the life I’ve had, and all the life I’m living stillEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught

Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talkin' about cars and dreamin' about women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute

Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little about love
Aw haw

Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
I was willin' but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home

Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talkin' about cars and dreamin' about women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little about love
Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee

The sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow
An' so am I
Work day passes like molasses in wintertime
But it's July
I'm gettin' paid by the hour, an' older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd like to call him somethin'
I think I'll just call it a day

Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

Oh, this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon
An' half the night
Tomorrow mornin', I know there'll be hell to pay
Hey, but that's all right
I ain't had a day off now in over a year
Our Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phone’s for me
You can tell 'em I just sailed away
And pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

I could pay off my tab, pour myself in a cab
An' be back to work before two
At a moment like this, I can't help but wonder
What would Jimmy Buffett do?
Funny you should ask Alan, I'd say:
"Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care"
Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
He don't care
I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

What time zone am I on? What country am I in?
It doesn't matter, it's five o'clock somewhere
It's always on five in Margaritaville, come to think of it
Yeah, I heard that
You been there haven't you
Yessir
I seen your boat there
I've been to Margaritaville a few times
All right, that's good
Stumbled all the way back
Okay, just wanna make sure you can keep it between the navigational beacons
Ha ha ha, between the buoys, I tell you
All right. Well, it's five o'clock. Let's go somewhere
I'm ready, crank it up
Let's get out of here
I'm gone8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Remember when I was young and so were you
And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried
Remember when

Remember when we vowed the vows
And walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt
Remember when

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when

Remember when the sound of little feet
Was the music
We danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up
Remember when
Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now lookn' back it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are
Where we've been
Said we'd do it all again
Remember when
Remember when we said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, "You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides"
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal
It was just an old hand me down Ford
With three speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I'd keep it right
He'd say "A little slower son, you're doing just fine"
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say

It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say "Turn it left" and "Steer it right"
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive
It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric chokeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Work, work all week long
Punching that clock from dusk till dawn
Counting the days till Friday night
That's when all the conditions are right
For a good time
I need a good time

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

I cashed my check, cleaned my truck
Put on my hat, forgot about work
Sun going down, head across town
Pick up my baby and turn it around
Good time
Ahh, I need a good time

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time
Pig in the ground, beer on ice
Just like ole Hank taught us about
Singing along, Bocephus songs
Rowdy friends, all night long
Good time
Lord, we're having a good time

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time
Whew!

Heel toe, do-si-do
Scooting our boots, swinging doors
B & D, Kix and Dunn
Honking tonk heaven, Double shotgun
Good time
Lord, we're having a good time
Cause

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time
Shot of Tequila, beer on tap
Sweet southern woman set on my lap
G with an O, O with a D
T with an I and an M and an E
And a good time
Shhheww, good time

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

Ahh, turn it up now!
A shot of Tequila
Beer on tap
A good looking woman
To set on my lap
A G with an O, an O with a D
A T with an I an M with an E
That spells good time
A good time
Ohh
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

Twelve o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock four
Five o'clock we know we're that's going to go
Closing the door, shutting them down
Head for that Waffle House way across town
Good time?
Ohh, we're having a good time
Ohh

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun

Well I was rolling wheels and shifting gears
Around that Jersey Turnpike
Barney stopped me with his gun
Ten minutes after midnight
Said, "Sir you broke the limit
In thit rusty old truck"
I don't know about that accent son
Just where did you come from

I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from
A lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from
Trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

Well I was south of Detroit City
I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue
The sign said finger-lickin'
Well I paid the tab
And the lady asked me
How'd I like my biscuit
I'll be honest with you ma'am
It ain't like mama fixed it
Cause where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from
A lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from
Trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

I was chasing sun on 101
Somewhere around Ventura
I lost a universal joint
And I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked
If I had plans for dinner
Said no thanks ma'am
Back home We like the girls
That sing soprano

I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Well I was headed home on 65
Somewhere around Kentucky
The CB rang for the bobtail rig
That's rolling on like thunder
Well I answered him and he asked me
Aren't you from out in Tulsa
No, but you might have seen me there
I just dropped a load of salsa

I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

Where I come from it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of back porch picking
Where I come from trying to make a living
Working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Yeah where I come from
A lot of front porch sitting
Staring up at heaven
Where I come from
Where I come from
Trying to make a living
Trying to make a living
Oh, where I come from
Where I come from
Yeah where I come from
Get back down there sometimes

I just came down from Chippewa
Had a station wagon and a hundred dollars
Thinking about the girl I'd lost a year before
I hadn't seen her for some time
Thought I might go on by
When your memory came flooding in and you closed that door

Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track
Crashing in your doorway
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal
Just to get me started
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a freight train

Well, every time I talk to you I hear your jealous lies
I feel like I've been left abandoned on some old railway side
And every time I hear your voice my water just gets cold
My stoker will not stoke and my boiler will not boil
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track
Crashing in your doorway
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal
Just to get me started
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a freight train

Well, every time I fell behind I could not get ahead
I wish someone would pull the lever and give me a little sand
And every time I slip behind even further back
I wish some switch man would come out of the fog and change my track

Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track
Crashing in your doorway
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal
Just to get me started
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a freight train
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track
Crashing in your doorway

Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?
Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Or go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching
And turn on "I Love Lucy" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Did you stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love

And the greatest is love
And the greatest is love

What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit
O what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer
Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged;
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness
Take it to the Lord in prayer1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If I survey all the good things that come to me from above
If I count all the blessings from the storehouse of love
I'd simply ask for the favor of him beyond mortal king
And I'm sure he would grant it again

I want to stroll over Heaven with you some glad day
When all our troubles and heartaches are vanished away
Then we'll enjoy the beauty where all things are new
I want to stroll over Heaven with you

So many places of beauty we long to see here below
But time and treasures have kept us from making plans as you know
But come the morning of rapture together we'll stand a new
While I stroll over Heaven with you

I want to stroll over Heaven with you some glad day
When all our troubles and heartaches are vanished away
Then we'll enjoy the beauty where all things are new
I want to stroll over Heaven with youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Excuse me ma'am, I saw you walking
I turned around, I'm not a stalker
Where you going? Maybe I can help you
My tank is full, I'd be obliged to take you

'Cause I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
I can get you where you need to go
'Cause I'm a country boy

You sure look good sitting in my right seat
Buckle up and I'll take you through the five speeds
Wind it up or I can slow it way down
In the woods or right up town

I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
Yeah I can get you where you need to go
'Cause I'm a country boy
Big thirty-fives, whining on the asphalt
Grabbing mud and slinging up some red dirt
'Cause I'm a country boy

My mufflers loud, dual thrust tubes
Crank the music and the tone gets real good
Let me know when we're getting close
You can slide on out or we can head on down the road

'Cause I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
Yeah, I can get you where you want to go
'Cause I'm a country boy

Bucket seats, soft as babies nude butt
Locking hubs to take you through a deep rut

'Cause I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down winding roads
Yeah I can get you where you need to go
'Cause I'm a country boy
Yeah, I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
I can get you where you want to go

Ah, I'm just a country boy

Midnight in Montgomery, Silver Eagle, lonely road
I was on my way to Mobile, for a big New Year's Eve show
I stopped for just a minute, to see a friend outside of town
Put my collar up, I found his name, and felt the wind die down

And a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise
Wearing shiny boots, a Nudie suit, and haunting haunted eyes
He said friend it's good to see you, it's nice to know you care
Then the wind picked up and he was gone, was he ever really there?

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there

Well I climbed back on that Eagle, took one last look around
Through red tail lights, a shadow moved, slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I can hear that whistle moan, I'm so lonesome I could cry
'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there

Yeah, he's always singing there
Oh, Hank's always singing thereEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share

And I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
And I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

I will cling to the old rugged cross

Like red on a rose
When your lips first smiled at me
I was captured instantly
To each his own
Like blue in the sky
The gaze of your willing eyes
Touched something deep inside
And the truth be known

Like all little children love pennies
And I love you because I know that
I can't do anything wrong
You're where I belong
Like red on a rose

And I love you

Cowboys and pioneers, come lend your eyes and ears
I've got the need to testify
Don't try to fill your nest out in the open west
'Cause there's a million ways to die

Six bullets in the gut or just a paper cut
Too many ways to quantify
They'll cut your ankle off to cure a minor cough
'Cause there's a million ways to die

(A million ways to die)
It's a hundred and one in the shade of the sun
If you fall asleep, you fry
(A million ways to die)
You can live like a saint but there just really ain't
No avoiding a million ways to die

Smallpox and bigger pox, and deadly tomahawks
Or God forbid you steal a pie
They'll blast you into shards for being good at cards
'Cause there's a million ways to die
Out on the desert plains it hardly ever rains
And you can hear coyotes cry
They'll eat you up and then they'll shit you out again
'Cause there's a million ways to die

(A million ways to die)
With a whoosh and a whack there's a knife in your back
'Cause you got a fancy tie
(A million ways to die)
It's a kick in the pants but you don't have a chance
Of escaping a million ways to die
(A million ways to die)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Have a little love on a little honeymoon
You got a little dish and you got a little spoon
A little bitty house and a little bitty yard
A little bitty dog and a little bitty car

Well, it's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while

A little bitty baby in a little bitty gown
It'll grow up in a little bitty town
Big yellow bus and little bitty books
It all started with a little bitty look

Little bitty world goes around and around
Little bit of silence and a little bit of sound

Start all over in a little bitty world
Little bitty plan and a little bitty dream
It's all part of a little bitty scheme

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come;
'tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I seeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Two young people without a thing
Say some vows and spread their wings
And settle down with just what they need
Livin' on love
She don't care 'bout what's in style
She just likes the way he smiles
It takes more than marble and tile
Livin' on love

Livin' on love, buyin' on time
Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime
Just like an old fashion story book rhyme
Livin' on love
It sounds simple, that's what you're thinkin'
But love can walk through fire without blinkin'
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Livin' on love

Two old people without a thing
Children gone but still they sing
Side by side in that front porch swing
Livin' on love
He can't see anymore
She can barely sweep the floor
Hand in hand they'll walk through that door
Just livin' on love
Livin' on love, buyin' on time
Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime
Just like an old fashion story book rhyme
Livin' on love
It sounds simple that's what you're thinkin'
But love can walk through fire without blinkin'
It doesn't take much when you get enough

Livin' on love, buyin' on time
Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime

But love can walk through fire without blinkin'
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Livin' on love

No it doesn't take much when you get enough

Daddy won a radio
He tuned it to a country show
I was rocking in the cradle to the crying of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me
She taught me that sweet harmony
Now she worries cause she never thought
I'd ever really take it this far
Singing in the bars

And chasing that neon rainbow
Living that honky-tonk dream
Cause all I've ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
Just trying to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and seen
I'm chasing that neon rainbow
Living that honky-tonk dream

An atlas and a coffee cup
Five pickers in an old Dodge truck
Heading down to Houston for a show on Saturday night
This overhead is killing me
Half the time I sing for free
When the crowd's into it, lord
It makes this thing I'm doing seem right
Standing in the spotlight
And chasing that neon rainbow
I'm-a living that honky-tonk dream
Cause all I've ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
Just trying to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and seen
I'm chasing that neon rainbow
Living that honky-tonk dream

Now daddy's got a radio
He won it thirty years ago
He said; son I just know
We're going to hear you singing on it some day
I made it up to Music Row
Lordy, don't the wheels turn slow
Still I wouldn't trade a minute
I wouldn't have it any other way
Just show me to the stage

I'm chasing that neon rainbow
I'm-a living that honky-tonk dream
Cause all I've ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
Just trying to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and seen
I'm chasing that neon rainbow
Living that honky-tonk dream
Oh I'm chasing that neon rainbow
