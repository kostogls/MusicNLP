Living on the road, my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear your skin like iron
Your breath's as hard as kerosene
You weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one, it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit, boys
His horse was fast as polished steel
Wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
But Pancho met his match, you know
In the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dying words
That's the way it goes
And all the federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him hang around
Out of kindness, I suppose
And Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
And where he got the bread to go
Ain't nobody knows
And all the federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose
Well, the poets tell how Pancho fell
Lefty's living in a cheap hotel
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold
So the story ends, we're told
Pancho needs your prayers, it's true
But save a few for Lefty, too
He just did what he had to do
And now he's growing old
And a few gray federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him go so wrong
Out of kindness, I suppose10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Sometimes, I don't know where this dirty road is taking me
Sometimes, I don't even know the reason why
But I guess I keep a-gamblin', lots of booze, and lots of ramblin'
Well, it's easier than just a-waitin' around to die

At one time, friends, I had a ma, I even had a pa
Well he beat her with a belt once 'cause she cried
She told him to take care of me, headed down to Tennessee
Well, it's easier than just a-waitin' around to die

I came of age and I found a girl in a Tuscaloosa bar
Ah, she cleaned me out and hit it on the sly
Well, I tried to kill the pain, I bought some wine and hopped a train
It seemed easier than just a-waitin' around to die

Then, a friend said he knew where some easy money was
We robbed a man, and, brother, did we fly
But the posse caught up with me and drug me back to Muskogee
And it's two long years a-waitin' around to die

Ah, but now, I'm out of prison, I got me a friend at last
He don't drink or steal or cheat or lie
Ah his name is Codeine, he's the nicest thing I've seen
Well, together, we're gonna wait around and die
Yeah, together, we're gonna wait around and die2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, won't you lend your lungs to me?
Mine are collapsing
Plant my feet and bitterly breathe
Up the time that's passing
Breath I'll take and breath I'll give
And pray the day's not poison
Stand among the ones that live
In lonely indecision

With fingers walk the darkness down
Mind is on the midnight
Gather up the gold you've found
You fool, it's only moonlight
If you try to take it home
Your hands will turn to butter
You better leave this dream alone
Try to find another

Salvation sat and crossed herself
Called the devil partner
Wisdom burned upon a shelf
Who'll kill the raging cancer
Seal the river at its mouth
Take the water prisoner
Fill the sky with screams and cries
Bathe in fiery answers

Well Jesus was an only son
And love his only concept
Strangers cry in foreign tongues
And dirty up the doorstep
And I for one, and you for two
Ain't got the time for outside
Keep your injured looks to you
And we'll tell the world that we tried4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If I needed you, would you come to me?
Would you come to me and ease my pain?
If you needed me, I would come to you
I would swim the seas for to ease your pain

In the night forlorn the morning's born
And the morning shines with the lights of love
And you will miss sunrise if you close your eyes
And that would break my heart in two

The lady's with me now since I showed her how
To lay her lily hand in mine
Loop and Lil agree she's a sight to see
A treasure for the poor to find

Well if I needed you, would you come to me?
Would you come to me and ease my pain?
If you needed me, I would come to you
I would swim the seas for to ease your pain7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well the drunken clown's still hanging round
But it's plain the laughter's all died down
The tears you tried so hard to hide are flowing
And a blind man with his knife in hand
Has convinced himself that he understands
I wish him well, Miss Carousel
But I got to be a-goin'

Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then?
I'll stand outside your window
And proudly call your name

Well, the lady's been told that all the gold
Is worth so much it can't be sold
No time to weep, she'll need her sleep tomorrow
When she carries her face to the market place
And bets it on the opening race
She can ring her bells, Miss Carousel
But her singing brings me sorrow

Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then?
I'll stand outside your window
And I'll proudly call your name
Well, it's always done, every mother's son
Is shown that grown men never run
So they fight with all the might inside them
When the battle's been fought and they've all been taught
That the trick is just not being caught
Will you give 'em hell, Miss Carousel
When they're begging you to hide them?

Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then?
I'll stand outside your window
And proudly call your name

When the need arose, your eyes fell closed
You clamped your fingers 'round your nose
Would you say that's any way to judge him?
Well, you haven't got the authority
To kill him in the first degree
But would you feel compelled, Miss Carousel
If you had something to begrudge him?

On a velvet beach far beneath the reach
Of those that come to pry and preach
The natural man that tried to stand is fallin'
Well, how long will it be before he sees
You own his legs, but his mind is free?
Only you can tell, Miss Carousel
How long will he be crawling?
Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then?
I'll stand outside your window
And proudly call your name

Ah the castle wall has grown so tall
Seems there ain't no hope at all to reach the top
Even though you stop for breathing
But I ain't gonna try to make you cry
The tear drops couldn't find your eyes
It's all been swell, Miss Carousel
But the time has come for leaving

Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then?
I'll stand outside your window
And proudly call your name
Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then?
I'll stand outside your window
And proudly call your name
Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then?
I'll stand outside your window
And proudly call your name
Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then?
I'll stand outside your window
And proudly call your name3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well there's no stronger wind than the one that blows down a lonesome railroad line
No prettier sight than lookin' back on a town you left behind
But there's nothin' that's as real as a love that's in my mind

Close your eyes
I'll be here in the morning
Close your eyes
I'll be here for a while

Well there's lots of things along the road I'd surely like to see
I'd like to lean into the wind and tell myself I'm free
But your softest whisper's louder than the highway's call to me

Close your eyes
I'll be here in the morning
Close your eyes
I'll be here for a while

All the mountains and the rivers and the valleys can't compare
To your blue lit dancin' eyes and yellow shining hair
I could never hit the open road and leave you lyin' there
Close your eyes
I'll be here in the morning
Close your eyes
I'll be here for a while

Ah lay your head back easy, love, close your cryin' eyes
I'll be layin' here beside you when the sun comes on the rise
I'll stay as long as the cuckoo wails and the lonesome blue jay cries

Close your eyes
I'll be here in the morning
Close your eyes
I'll be here for a while
Close your eyes
I'll be here in the morning
Close your eyes
I'll be here for a while2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I heard her sing in tongues of silver
I heard her cry on a summer storm
I loved her, but she did not know it
So I don't think about her anymore
Now she's gone and I can't believe it
So I don't think about her anymore

If three and four were seven only
Where would that leave one and two?
If love can be and still be lonely
Where does that leave me and you?
Time there was and time there will be
Where does that leave me and you?

If I had a buckskin stallion
I'd tame him down and ride away
If I had a flying schooner
I'd sail into the light of day
If I had your love forever
Sail into the light of day

Pretty songs and pretty places
Places that I've never seen
Pretty songs and pretty faces
Tell me what their laughter means
Some look like they'll cry forever
Tell me what their laughter means
If I had a buckskin stallion
I'd tame him down and ride away
And if I had a golden galleon
I'd sail into the light of day
If I had your love forever
Sail into the light of dayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hey mama, when you leave, don't leave a thing behind
I don't want nothing, I can't use nothing
Take care into the hall and if you see my friends
Tell 'em I'm fine, not using nothing

Almost burned out my eyes and threw my ears down to the floor
I didn't see nothing, I didn't hear nothing
I stood there like a block of stone knowing all I had to know
And nothing more, man, that's nothing

'Cause, brothers, our troubles are locked in each others arms
And you better pray that they never find you
'Cause your back ain't strong enough for burdens double fold
They'd crush you down, down into nothing

Being born is going blind and bowing down a thousand times
To echoes strung on pure temptation
Sorrow and solitude, these are the precious things
And the only words that are worth remembering1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Why does she sing
Her sad songs for me, I'm not the one
To tenderly bring
Her soft sympathy, I've just begun
To see my way clear and it's plain
If I stop I will fall
I can lay down a tear for her pain
Just a tear and that's all
What does she want me to do?
She says that she knows
That moments are rare
I suppose that it's true
Then on she goes to say I don't care
Aw, she knows that I do

Maybe she just has to sing for the sake of the song
Who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong?

She'd like to think I was cruel
But she knows that's a lie for I would be
No more than a tool
If I allowed her to cry all over me
Ah my sorrow is real
Even though I can't change my plans
If she could see how I feel
Then I know she'd understand
Ah does she actually think I'm to blame?
Does she really believe that some word of mine
Could relieve all her pain?
Can't she see that she grieves
Just because she's been blindly deceived
By her shame

Ah but maybe she just has to sing for the sake of the song
Who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong?

Ah but nothin's what it seems
Maybe she'll start some day to realize
If she abandons her dreams
Then all the words she can say are only lies
Ah when will she see that to gain
Is only to lose
All that she offers me are her chains
And I got to refuse
Ah but it's only to herself that she's lied
She likes to pretend
There's something that she should defend
With her pride
And I don't intend
To stand here and be the friend
From whom she must hide
Maybe she just has to sing for the sake of the song
Who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong?
Ah but maybe she just has to sing for the sake of the songEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If I had a dollar bill
Yes, I believe, I surely will
Go to town and drink my fill
Early in the morning

Little darling, she's a red-haired thing
Lord, she makes my legs to sing
Gonna buy her a diamond ring
Early in the morning

Well Mother was a golden girl
I slit her throat just to get her pearls
Cast myself into a whirl
Before a bunch of swine

It's a long way down the Harlan Road
Busted back and a heavy load
Won't get through to save my soul
Early in the morning

I've always been a gambling man
I've rolled them bones with either hand
Seven is the promised land
Early in the morning

Whiskey be my dying bed
Tell me where to lay my head
"Not with me" is all she said
Early in the morning

If I had a dollar bill
Yes, I believe, I surely will
Go to town and drink my fill
Early in the morning2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My lover comes to me with a rose on her bosom
The moon is dancin' purple all through her black hair
And her ladies-in-waiting, she'll stand 'neath my window
And the sun will rise soon on the false and the fair
Sing a-to Lorelei-oh

She tells me she comes from my mother the mountain
And her skin fits her tightly and her lips do not lie
She silently slips from her throat a medallion
Slowly she twirls it in front of my eyes
Sing a-to Lorelei-oh

I watch her, I love her, and I long for to touch her
The satin she's wearin' is shimmering blue
And outside my window, her ladies are sleeping
My dogs are gone hunting, their howling is through
Sing a-to Lorelei-oh

So I reach for her hand and her eyes turn to poison
And her hair turns to splinters and her flesh turns to brine
She leaps across the room, she stands in the window
Screams that my first-born will surely be blind
Sing a-to Lorelei-oh
And she throws herself out to the black of the nightfall
She's parted her lips, but she makes not a sound
I fly down the stairway and I run to the garden
No trace of my true love is there to be found
Sing a-to Lorelei-oh

So walk these hills lightly and watch who you're lovin'
By mother the mountain, I swear that it's true
And love not a woman with hair black as midnight
And her dress made of satin all shimmering blue
Sing a-to Lorelei-oh

Ah my lover comes to me with a rose on her bosom
The moon's dancing purple all through her black hair
And her ladies-in-waiting, she'll stand 'neath my window
And the sun will rise soon on the false and the fairEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The name she gave was Caroline
The daughter of a miner
And her ways were free and it seemed to me
That sunshine walked beside her

She come from Spencer across the hill
She said her pa had sent her
'Cause the coal was low and soon the snow
Would turn the skies to winter

She said she'd come to look for work
She was not seekin' favors
And for a dime a day and a place to stay
She'd turn those hands to labor

But the times were hard, Lord, and the jobs were few
All through Tecumseh Valley
But she asked around and a job she found
Tending bar for Gypsy Sally

She saved enough to get back home
When spring replaced the winter
But her dreams were denied, her pa had died
The word come down from Spencer
So she turned to whorin' out on the streets
With all the lust inside her
And it was many a man returned again
To lay himself beside her

They found her down beneath the stairs
That led to Gypsy Sally's
And in her hand when she died was a note that cried
"Fare thee well, Tecumseh Valley"

The name she gave was Caroline
The daughter of a miner
And her ways were free and it seemed to me
That sunshine walked beside herEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, the diamond fades quickly when matched to the face of Maria
All the harps, they sound empty when she lifts her lips to the sky
All the brown of her skin makes her hair seem a soft golden rainfall
That spills from the mountains to the bottomless depths of her eyes

Well, she stands all around me, her hands slowly sifting the sunshine
All the laughter that lingered down deep 'neath her smilin' is free
Well, it spins and it twirls like a hummingbird lost in the morning
And caresses the south wind and silently sails to the sea

Ah, the sculptor stands stricken and the artist he throws away his brushes
When her image comes dancin', the sun, she turns sullen with shame
And the birds, they go silent, and the wind stops his sad mournful singing
When the trees of the forest start gently to whisperin' her name

So as softly she wanders, I'll desperately follow her footsteps
And I'll chase after shadows that offer a trace of her sigh
Ah, they promise eternally that she lies hidden within them
But I find they've deceived me and sadly I bid them goodbye

So the serpent slides slowly away with his moments of laughter
And the old washerwoman has finished her cleanin' and gone
But the bamboo hangs heavy in the bondage of quicksilver daydreams
And a lonely child longingly looks for a place to belong1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I stood in line and left my name
Took about six hours or so
Well, the man just grinned like it was all a game
Said they'd let me know
I put in my time till the Pocono line
Shut down two years ago
I was staying at the mission till I met Marie
Now I can't stay there no more
Fella across town said he's looking for a man
To move some old cars around
Maybe me and Marie could find a burned-out van
And do a little settling down
But I'm just dreaming—I ain't got no ride
And the junkyard's a pretty good ways
That job's about a half-week old besides
It'd be gone now anyway
Unemployment says I got no more checks
And they showed me to the hall
My brother died in Georgia some time ago
I got no one left to call
Summer wasn't bad below the bridge
A little short on food, that's all
Now I gotta get Marie some kind of coat
We're headed down into fall
I used to play the mouth harp pretty good
Hustled up a little dough
But I got drunk and I woke up rolled
A couple of months ago
They got my harp and they got my dollar
Them lowlife so-and-sos
Harps cost money and I ain't got it
It's my own fault, I suppose
The Pocono's down, but the Chesapeake's running
Two freights everyday
If it was just me, I'd be headed south
But Marie can't catch no train
She's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby
Says we gotta wait and see
In my heart, I know it's a little boy
Hope he don't end up like me
Well, the man's still grinning, said he lost my file
I gotta stand in line again
I want to kill him, but I just say "No
I had enough of that line, my friend"
I head back to the bridge, it's getting kinda cold
I'm feeling too low down to lie
I guess I'll just tell Marie the truth
Hope she don't break down and cry
Marie, she didn't wake up this morning
She didn't even try
She just rolled over and went to Heaven
My little boy safe inside
I laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them
Caught a Chesapeake on the fly
Marie will know I'm headed south
So as to meet me by and by
Marie'll know I'm headed south
So to meet me by and byEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Won't say I love you, babe
Won't say I need you, babe
But I'm gonna get you babe
And I will not do you wrong
Living's mostly wasting time
And I'll waste my share of mine
But it never feels too good
So let's don't take too long

Well you're soft as glass
And I'm a gentle man
We got the sky to talk about
And the world to lie upon

Days, up and down they come
Like rain on a conga drum
Forget most, remember some
But don't turn none away
Everything is not enough
And nothin' is too much to bear
Where you been is good and gone
All you keep's the getting there
Well to live is to fly
All low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes

It's goodbye to all my friends
It's time to go again
Think of all the poetry
And the pickin' down the line
I'll miss the system here
The bottom's low and the treble's clear
But it don't pay to think too much
On things you leave behind

Well I may be gone
But it won't be long
I'll be a-bringin' back the melody
And the rhythm that I find

We all got holes to fill
And them holes are all that's real
And some fall on you like a storm
Sometimes you dig your own
The choice is yours to make
And time is yours to take
Some dive into the sea
Some toil upon the stone

Well to live's to fly
All low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes
Well shake the dust off of your wings
And the tears out of your eyes4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well I used to wake and run with the moon
I lived like a rake and a young man
I covered my lovers with flowers and wounds
My laughter, the Devil would frighten
The sun, she would come and beat me back down
But every cruel day had its nightfall
I'd welcome the stars with wine and guitars
Full of fire and forgetful

My body was sharp, my dark hair clean
And outrage my joyful companion
And whispering women, how sweet did they seem
Kneeling for me to command them
And time was like water, but I was the sea
I wouldn't have noticed it passing
Except for the turning of night into day
And the turning of day into cursing

Well, you look at me now, don't think I don't know
What all your eyes are a-saying
Does he want us to believe these ravings and lies
They're just tricks that his brain's been a-playing?
A lover of women, he can't hardly stand
He trembles, he's bent, and he's broken
I've fallen, it's true, but I say to you
Hold your tongues until after I've spoken

I was taking my pride in the pleasures I'd known
I laughed and said I'll be forgiven
But my laughter turned round, eyes blazing, and said
"Friend, we're holding a wedding"
I buried my face, but it spoke once again
The night to the day we're a-binding
And now the dark air is like fire on my skin
And even the moonlight is blinding
Now the dark air is like fire on my skin
And even the moonlight is blindingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If you're feelin' unlovin'
Well, if you're feelin' unfeelin'
If you're feelin' alone
Don't you take it too bad

Well, it's only a game made
Out of all of this livin'
That we got left to do

And if you go searchin'
For rhyme or for reason
Then you won't have the time
That it takes just for talkin'
'Bout the places you've been, babe
'Bout the faces you've seen, babe
And how soft the time flies
Past your window at night

And we just can't have that, girl
'Cause it's a sad, lonesome, cold world
And a man needs a woman
To stand by his side
And whisper sweet words
In his ears about daydreams
And roses and playthings
And the sweetness of springtime
And the sound of the rainEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Days full of rain, sky's coming down again
I get so tired of these same old blues
Same old song
Baby, it won't be long before I'll be tying on
My flyin' shoes, flyin' shoes
Till I'll be tying on my flyin' shoes

Spring only sighed, summer had to be satisfied
Fall is a feeling that I just can't lose
I'd like to stay, maybe watch a winter day
Turn the green water to white and blue
Flyin' shoes, flyin' shoes
Till I'll be tying on my flyin' shoes

The mountain moon forever sets too soon
Being alone is all the hills can do
Alone and then her silver sails again
And they will follow in
Their flyin' shoes, flyin' shoes
They will follow in their flyin' shoes

Days full of rain, sky's coming down again
I get so tired of these same old blues
Same old song
Baby, it won't be long till I'll be tying on
My flying shoes, flying shoes

So close and yet so far away
And all the things I'd hoped to say
Will have to go unsaid today
Perhaps until tomorrow
Your fears have built a wall between
Our lives and all that lovin' means
Will have to go unfelt, it seems
And that leaves only sorrow

You built your tower strong and tall
Can't you see it's got to fall someday?

Close your eyes and speak to me
Of faith and love and destiny
As distant as eternity
And truth and understanding
The wind blows cold outside your door
It whispers words I've tried before
But you don't hear me anymore
Your pride's just too demanding
You built your tower strong and tall
Can't you see it's got to fall someday?

The end is coming soon, it's plain
A warm bed just ain't worth the pain
And I will go and you'll remain
With the bitterness we tasted
A mother's breast, a newborn child
A poet's tears and a drunken smile
Can't help thinkin' all the while
Their meaning won't be wasted

You built your tower strong and tall
Can't you see it's got to fall someday?3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
