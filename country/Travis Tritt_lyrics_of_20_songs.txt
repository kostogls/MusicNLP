I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey
I'm doin' alright

Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no
I'm just doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

It's been fifteen years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright

Now I look in the mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doing alright
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

Sometimes it's lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm falling, desperately calling
Howlin' at the moon ah-ooh


Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a Fu-Manchu

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this goodEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well I play an old guitar from nine till half past one
I'm just tryin' to make a livin' watching everybody else havin' fun
Well I don't miss much if it happens on a dancehall floor

I was a little bitty baby when my papa hit the skids
Mama had a time tryin' to raise nine kids
She told me not to stare cause it was impolite
She did the best she could to try to raise me right
Cause mama never told me 'bout nothin' like Y-O-U
Bet your mama musta been another good lookin' honey too
Hey good L double O-K-I-N-G
Well I smell T-R-O-U-B-L-E
Well a sweet talkin', sexy walkin', honky tonkin' baby
The men are gonna love ya and the woman gonna hate ya
Remindin' them of everything they're never gonna be
May be the beginning of a world war three
Cause the world ain't ready for nothing like Y-O-U
I bet your mama musta been another good lookin' mama too
Hey say hey good L double O-K-I-N-G

Baby, close that suitcase you've been packin'
Just sit down and talk to me a while
I know you tried to tell me what was lackin'
But I guess I must have missed it by a mile

Well, this time girl I swear to you I'll listen
Help me understand where I went wrong
It's hard to find myself in this position
Scared that I'll go crazy once you're gone

Help me hold on to what we had
Once our love was strong, it can be again
You said it takes two to make love last
You were right all along, so help me hold on

What have I got to do to make it better?
What have I got to do to make you see?
That even though I promised you forever
I never knew how hard that would be

I realize I took your love for granted
But I've learned that love worth havin' don't come free
And I'll pay any price it takes to keep you
Satisfied and stayin' here with me
Help me hold on to what we had
Once our love was strong, it can be again
You said it takes two to make love last
You were right all along, so help me hold on

Help me hold on to what we had
Once our love was strong, it can be again

I can't hide the way I feel about you
Anymore
I can't hold the hurt inside, keep the pain out of my eyes
Anymore

My tears no longer waiting
My resistance ain't that strong
My mind keeps recreating
A life with you alone
And I'm tired of pretending
I don't love you anymore

Let me make one last appeal to show you how I feel
About you (Mhm)
'Cause there's no one else, I swear, holds a candle anywhere
Next to you (Mmm-hmm)

My heart can't take the beating
Not havin' you to hold
A small voice keeps repeating
Deep inside my soul
It says I can't keep pretending
I don't love you anymore
I've got to take the chance or let it pass by
If I expect to get on with my life


My tears no longer waiting
Oh, my resistance ain't that strong
But my mind keeps recreating
A life with you alone
And I'm tired of pretending
I don't love you anymore

She stayed up all night and cried into her pillow
And fought off the urge to just break down and call
Last night to find the fault seemed so darn easy
But now who's to blame don't matter much at all
She thinks if she calls him, it just shows weakness
So the hurt goes on with every tear she's cried
Ain't it sad to see a good love fall to pieces
Chalk another heartbreak up to foolish pride
Turn out the lights, the competition's over
The stubborn souls are the losers here tonight
And while the bridges burn
Another hard, hard lesson's learned
As in the ashes passion slowly dies
And this romance goes down to foolish pride (Yeah)

He relives every word they spoke in anger
He walks the floor and punches out the wall
To apologize to her, would be so simple
But instead he cries, "I'll be damned if I'll crawl"
If he loses her, he's lost his best friend
And more than just a lover can provide
So he wrestles with emotions that defeat him
Chalk another love lost up to foolish pride
Turn out the lights, the competition's over
The stubborn souls are the losers here tonight
Yeah, and while the bridges burn
Another hard, hard lesson's learned
As in the ashes passion slowly dies
And this romance goes down to foolish pride

Chalk another love lost up to foolish pride

You say you were wrong to ever leave me alone
And now you're sorry, you're lonesome and scared
And you say you'd be happy if you could just come back home
Well, here's a quarter, call someone who cares

Call someone who'll listen, and might give a damn
Maybe one of your sordid affairs
But don't you come around here handing me none of your lies
Here's a quarter, call someone who cares

Girl, I thought what we had could never turn bad
So your leaving caught me unaware
But the fact is you've run. Girl, that can't be undone
So here's a quarter, call someone who cares

Call someone who'll listen, or might give a damn

Daddies were Daddies and Mamas were saints
What preachers were preachin', you could take to the bank
Kids played outside up until it turned dark
When the world turned slower and you could smoke in a bar

Trucks took a beatin', the workin' man too
You could turn on the six o'clock and get the whole truth
A seatbelt was a backup for Mama's right arm
When the world turned slower and you could smoke in a bar

My, oh my, how times have changed
But man, sometimes, I miss them old days
They say we'vе come a long way, but I'd say it's a little bit too far
From when thе world turned slower and you could smoke in a bar

Neighbors came by and talked on the porch
We all said goodnight and never locked the front door
Even downtown, you could still see the stars
When the world turned slower and you could smoke in a bar

My, oh my, how times have changed
But man, sometimes, I miss them old days
They say we've come a long way, but I'd say it's a little bit too far
From when the world turned slower and you could smoke in a bar
A deal was a deal when you shook a man's hand
When we saw the flag flyin', we all gave a damn

My, oh my, how times have changed
But man, sometimes, I miss them old days
They say we've come a long way, but I'd say it's a little bit too far

Well, I'm a runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind:
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can, don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy
Well, I'm a standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see:
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flat bed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me
Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win though we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in, so take it easy
Well, I'm a runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
Oh, we got it easy

There was a time I could drink my cares away
And drown out all of the heartaches that hurt me night and day
When the thought of you came crashin' through, I'd have one more
But now the whiskey ain't workin' anymore
I need one good honky tonk angel to turn my life around
That's reason enough for me to lay this old bottle down
A woman warm and willing, that's what I'm looking for
'Cause the whiskey ain't workin' anymore
They knew my name at every bar in town
And they knew all of the reasons why I was coming round, round, round (sing it, Travis)
'Cause in my mind, peace I'd find, when they'd start to pour
But now the whiskey ain't workin' anymore (sing it, son)

Bobby played his guitar on the harder side of town
Where it's hard for a poor boy to find the money
He had dedication, he had the heart and soul
Somehow knew he was born to play

People said "Get a real job, support your family
'Cause there's no future on the road your takin'"
He never said a word, the dreamer just kept on
Late at night you could hear him say, he said

I'm gonna be somebody
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
I'm gonna be somebody someday
You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will

The road was a struggle, took him ten years to the top
And now he's number one on the stage and the radio
Still he can't believe how people come from miles around
When it seems like only yesterday when he would say

I'm gonna be somebody
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
I'm gonna be somebody someday
You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bobby played his hometown, one full moon August night
When he heard a voice in the front row singin'
It was a sandy-haired rebel boy with the same ol' hungry eyes
He looked up at Bobby and said (Mmm)

I'm gonna be somebody
One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
And I'm gonna be somebody someday
You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will
You know I will, yeah, yeah

Well, he was the assistant preacher and a Sunday School teacher in the church that I grew up in
She was a looker from Atlanta; led the choir; played piano; had a body that was made for sin
She didn't care he was married 'cause the torch that she carried was hotter than the fires of Hell
She had plans to seduce him, and she knew she would loosen a notch in the Bible Belt
So she called him up at home when she knew he'd be alone, said, "Preacher, I could use advice."
"I got troubles with the Man that I know you'll understand. If you could help me it would sure be nice."
They met a few minutes after in the office of the pastor, and she started telling how she felt
What a chance they were takin' when they first started breakin' the law from the Bible Belt
There's a lot of good people who were led astray that believe what the Good Book said
Well, I'll tell you something, brother, when you're dealin' with the Devil it's tough to keep a level head
And, it's hard to imagine how the flames of passion will burn 'til your soul will melt
And it'll spread like a cancer 'cause you're gonna have to answer to the Lord in the Bible Belt
Someone said they went to Vegas. Back home it didn't take us long to hear the news of what they did
I just can't believe that he left his wife to grieve alone with two pre-school kids
I don't know how they're doin', but I know that they're screwin' up a good thing they once had
They better get their heads together or they're gonna slap leather with the Lord in the Bible Belt
There's a lot of good people who were led astray that believe what the Good Book said

I had big plans for our future
Said I'd give you the whole world somehow
I tried makin' good on that promise
Thought I'd be so much further by now
Never could build you a castle
Even though you're the queen of my heart
But I've had the best of intentions from the start

Now some people think I'm a loser
'Cause I seldom get things right
But you make me feel like a winner
When you wrap me in your arms so tight
Please tell me you will remember
No matter how much I do wrong
That I had the best of intentions all along

I'd gave you a ring, and I promised you things
I always thought we'd do
But my best-laid plans slipped right through my hands
To show my love for you
And if you could read my heart
Then you'd know without exception
It was all with the best of intentions
I'd gave you a ring, and I promised you things
I always thought we'd do
But my best-laid plans slipped right through my hands
To show my love for you
And if you could read my heart
Then you'd know without exception
It was all with the best of intentions

So here I am asking forgiveness
And praying that you'll understand
Don't think I take you for granted
Girl, I know just how lucky I am
Though you deserve so much better
You won't find devotion more true
'Cause I've had the best of intentions
Girl, I've had the best of intentions
Yes, I've had the best of intentions

I took a double take out on the interstate
When I saw her makin' eyes at me
So I followed her down to Clubhouse Drive
Past the pool and the 18th green
And in the parkin' lot I said,  It's mighty hot
Maybe I could buy you a beer
She said, "I'm glad you asked, but I'll have to pass
Cause only members are allowed in here ... and I said
I'm a member of a country club
Country music is what I love
I drive an old Ford pick-up truck
I do my drink-in from a dixie cup
Yea I'm a bona-fide dancin' fool
I shoot a mighty mean game of pool
At any honky-tonk or roadside pub
I'm a member of a country club"
You look so invitin'...thought it might be excitin'
For a woman with a limousine
To go bouncin around in a beat up truck
With a man in wore out jeans
It's five o'clock before Friday night
Here's where the fun begins
So don't worry 'bout your reputation
Cause you can tell all your friends ...
That I'm a member of a country club
Country music is what I love
I drive an old Ford pick-up truck
I do my drink-in from a dixie cup
Yea I'm a bona-fide dancin' fool

When I woke up this mornin'
Wiped the sleep from my eyes
I found a new day dawning
And suddenly I realized
You're gone

Tell me I was dreamin'
That you didn't leave me here to cry
You didn't say you don't love me anymore
It was just my imagination tellin' lies
Tell me that you didn't say goodbye

I'm in a state of confusion
I hope things aren't what they seem
If this is really happening
Just let me go back to dream
You're home

Tell me I was dreamin'
That you didn't leave me here to cry
You didn't say you don't love me anymore
It was just my imagination tellin' lies
Tell me that you didn't say goodbye
Oh, oh-oh

Tell me I was dreamin' (tell me I was dreamin')
That you didn't leave me here to cry
You didn't say you don't love me anymore
It was just my imagination tellin' lies
Oh, oh-oh, tell me that you didn't say goodbye

Darlin', tell me you didn't say goodbye

When you meet that certain someone you've been searching hard to find
It's a new love full of passion that can sometimes make you blind
I don't mind being swept away if I know right from the start
So before we go much further girl, can I trust you with my heart

In the time we've spent together, I have learned to trust in you
So many things you've given before I even asked you to
But reality and romance are sometimes far apart
So what I really need to know is, can I trust you with my heart

Can I cast my cares upon you, can you stand the heavy load
Can I count on you to walk me down that long and winding road
If you promise me these simple things, I can guarantee
You can always count on me girl, oh

Can I cast my cares upon you, can you stand the heavy load
Can I count on you to walk me down that long and winding road
When two hearts solely surrender, and are sworn to understand
It completes a perfect union between a woman and a man
So please don't misunderstand me, I don't want to go too far
Without knowing just one answer, can I trust you with my heart
Please girl
Give me just one answer
Can I trust you with my heartEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a redhead ridin' shotgun
And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde
We met at a truckstop
Johnson City, Tennessee
I was gassin' up my Firebird
When I heard her callin' me...mmm hmm
Said, 'Which way are you headed, boy
Do you need some company'
She had me stoppin' at a quick mart
Before we made it out of town
Next thing she was runnin' at me
Tellin' me to lay that hammer down
Cause there's a man right behind me
Doin' his best to slow me down
Yeah and it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a redhead ridin' shotgun
And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde
Woo...
Well we pulled up to a motel
In the middle of the night
We were countin' all the money
Smokin' stolen Marlboro lights
Lord we never saw 'em comin'
'Til they read us both our rights
Yeah and it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a sheriff right beside me
Pistol pointed at my side
Oh, Lord...such a disappointing ending
For this modern day Bonnie and Clyde
Yeah...
Whoa
Well...
Woo...hoo1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

As we sat on the front porch
Of that old grey house where I was born and raised
Staring at the dusty fields
Where my daddy worked hard everyday
I think it kinda hurt him when I said
"Daddy there's a lot that I don't know
But don't you ever dream about a life
Where corn don't grow?"
He just sat there silent
Staring at his favorite coffee cup
I saw a storm of mixed emotions in his eyes
When he looked up
He said "son I know at your age
It seems like this ole world is turnin' slow
And you think you'll find the answer to it all
Where corn don't grow."
Hard times are real
There's dusty fields no matter where you go
You may change your mind
Cause the weeds are high where corn don't grow
I remember feeling guilty
When Daddy turned and walked back in the house
I was only 17 back then
But I thought that I knew more than I know now
I can't say he didn't warn me
This city life's a hard row to hoe
Ain't it funny how a dream can turn around
Where corn don't grow
Hard times are real
There's dusty fields no matter where you go
You may change your mind
Cause the weeds are high where corn don't grow
You may change your mind
Oh the weeds are high where corn don't growEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I sit here surrounded by people and lights
Alone with my drink at the bar
You've been here forever, so clear in my mind
I just don't know where you are
I know I'll find you but girl 'til I do
This is my love song for you
Let's hold hands on the porch swing, under the moon
While the wind through the willows plays us a tune
We can lie on a blanket, out back in the yard
And wish for our future on a faraway star
You'll feel the passion as time after time
I press your sweet lips to mine
Then we'll dance to the radio, right up 'til dawn
'Til you drift off to dream in my arms
You might be hundreds or more miles away
Or you might be just down the street
But there'll be a hunger deep in your eyes
That I'll recognize when we meet
It might take hours or it might take years
But this is the song you will hear
Let's hold hands on the porch swing, under the moon
While the wind through the willows plays us a tune
We can lie on a blanket, out back in the yard
And wish for our future on a faraway star
You'll feel the passion as time after time
I press your sweet lips to mine
Then we'll dance to the radio, right up 'til dawn

I don't want to lose you
But I don't want to use you
Just to have somebody by my side
I don't want to hate you
I don't want to take you
But I don't want to be the one to cry
And that don't really matter to anyone anymore
But like a fool
I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes, love just ain't enough
Now, I could never change you
I don't want to blame you
Baby, you don't have to take the fall
Yes, I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all
It makes a sound like thunder
It makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough

And there's no way home
When it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say?
And do you feel me beside you in your bed
There beside you where I used to lay?

And there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are
Baby, sometimes, love just ain't enough
Baby, sometimes, love
It just ain't enough

I know living with me ain't always easy
I dam up emotions some men just let flow
But girl when you're not by my side I feel a part of me has died
'Cause I love you more than you'll ever know
(Chorus)
More than life, more than I've ever loved before
It's absurd and beyond words, I couldn't want you more
And when I try to pour my heart out to you I'm not sure it shows
That I love you more than you'll ever know
I'm sure you've heard it said hearts have windows
But mine has doors a painful past has closed
Unless someday they open wide revealing feelings locked inside
I'll love you more than you'll ever know
Repeat (Chorus)
Even when I pour my heart out to you I'm not sure it shows
That I love you more than you'll ever know
Yes I love you more than you'll ever knowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
