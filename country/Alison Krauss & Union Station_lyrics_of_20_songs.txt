It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may, I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

All day long I can hear people talking aloud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
Old Mr. Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You're the lucky one
So I've been told
As free as the wind
Blowing down the road
Loved by many, hated by none
I'd say you're lucky 'cause I know what you've done
Not a care in the world
Not a worry in sight
Everything's gonna be alright
Cause you're the lucky one

You're the lucky one
Always having fun
A jack of all trades a master none

You look at the world with a smiling eye
And laugh at the devil as his train goes by
Give you a song and a one night stand
And you'll be looking at a happy man
'cause you're the lucky one
Well you're blessed i guess
By never knowing which road your choosing
To you the next best thing
To playing and winning is playing and losing
You're the lucky one
I know that now
Don't ask you why, when, where, or how

You look at the world through your smiling eye
And laugh at the devil as his train goes by
Give you a song and a one night stand
And you'll be looking at a happy man
'cause you're the lucky one
Well you're blessed I guess
By never knowing which road your choosing
To you the next best thing
To playing and winning is playing and losing
You're the lucky one I know that now
Don't ask you why, when, where, or how
No matter where you're at, it's where you'll be
You can bet your luck won't follow me
Just give you a song and a one night stand
And you'll be looking at a happy man
Cause you're the lucky one1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's been a long time coming
As you shed a lonesome tear
Now you're in a wonderama
I wonder what you're doing here
The flame no longer flickers
You're feeling just like a fool
You keep staring into your liquor
Wondering what to do

I don't hardly know you
But I'd be willing to show you
I know a way to make you smile
Let me touch you for awhile

I'm gonna ruin my black mascara
You're drinking whiskey when it should be wine
You keep on looking into that mirror
But to me you're looking really fine

I don't hardly know you
But I'd be willing to show you
I know a way to make you laugh at that cowgirl
As she's walking out your door
I know a way to make you smile
Just let me whisper things you never heard before
Just let me touch you, baby
Just let me touch you for a while

I don't hardly know
But I'd be willing to show you
I know a way to make you smile
It's been a long time
Let me touch you for a whileEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm a poor boy as you know
But I love the Captain's daughter so
If I begged her would she go?
Or would she tell me no, no, no, no, no?
Daddy is a sailor man
Your fresh from the farm land
He said when you ask my hand
For me to tell you no, no, no, no, no


Your daddy's gone away to sea
You're as lovely as can be
Come and go away with me
Oh, don't you tell me no, no, no, no, no

My daddy owns a clipper ship
He brings me pearls on every trip
Pink champagne for me to sip
And you're the poorest boy I know, know, know, know, know

I've got no pearls to give you
I've got two arms and heart that's true
We could start with a dream or two
Oh won't you say you'll go, go?
The poor boy came from the farm land
She was the daughter of a sailor man
The Captain says 'When he begs your hand
You better tell him no, no, no, no, no'

She said 'Papa don't you worry please
The poor boy begs me upon his knees
I'd never leave this life of ease
And with the poor boy go'

The captain kissed her and he went to sea
The poor boy said 'Go away with me
You're lonely and you shouldn't be
Oh, don't you tell me no, no, no, no, no'

My daddy owns a clipper ship
He brings me pearls on every trip
Pink champagne for me to sip
And you're the poorest boy I know, know, know, know, know
Your daddy's given you a home
But you've got nobody when he is gone
I'll go and leave you all alone
If the answer is still no, no, no, no, noEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I've put it all behind me
Nothing left to do or doubt
Some may say
But every silver lining always seems to have a cloud
That comes my way

Anticipated pleasure or unexpected pain
No choice I fear
And love is hard to measure hidden in the rain
That's why you'll find me

Here all alone and still wondering why
Waiting inside for the cold to get colder
And here where it's clear that I've wasted my time
Hoping to fly cause it's almost over now

People come together, people go their own way
Love conquers few
And I'll do whatever, I'll say what I need to say
Just not for you

How many days should I smile with a frown?
Cause you're not around with the sun on your shoulders
And how many nights must I wake up alone?
And know in my soul that it's almost over now
Our love is like a paper airplane flying in the folded wind
Riding high, dipping low
And innocence is fair game, I'm hoping I can hold it in
Our love will die, I know5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Out on the hills of gloryland
So happy and free at God's right hand
They tell of a place of marvelous grace
On heaven's bright shore
Pilgrims on earth some day will go
To live in that home for evermore
Trusting in him who died for sin
And rose from the grave
On heaven's bright shore (on heaven's bright shore)
There's gonna be no more dyin' (over there)
Not one little grave (not one little grave)
In all that fair land (that wonderful land)
Not even a tear will dim the eye
And no one up there will say goodbye
Just singing his praise through endless days
On heaven's bright shore (on heaven's bright shore)
When I must cross that rolling tide
There'll be someone on the other side
Welcoming me to that fair land
Made perfect by love
When I walk up that milky white way
I'll see that home coming in array
How great it must be for angels
To see a pilgrim reach home
On heaven's bright shore (on heaven's bright shore)
There's gonna be no more dyin' (over there)
Not one little grave (not one little grave)
In all that fair land (that wonderful land)
Not even a tear will dim the eye
And no one up there will say goodbye
Just singing his praise through endless days
On heaven's bright shore (on heaven's bright shore)
Just singing his praise through endless days

Tell you a little story and it won't take long
'Bout a lazy farmer who wouldn't hoe his corn
The reason why I never could tell
For that young man was always well
He planted his corn in the month of June
By July it was up to his eyes
Come September, came a big frost
And all the young man's corn was lost
His courtship had just begun
Said: "Young man, have you hoed some corn?"
"Well I tried and I tried, and I tried in vain
"But I don't believe I raised one grain."
He went down town to his neighbour's door
Where he had often been before
Sayin': "Pretty little miss, will you marry me?"
"Little miss, what do you say?"
"Why do you come for me to wed?
"You can't even make your own cornbread
"Single I am, and will remain
"A lazy man, I won't maintain."
He turned his back and walked away
Sayin': "Little miss, you'll rue the day
"You'll rue the day that you were born
"For givin' me the devil 'cause I wouldn't hoe corn."EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Sometimes I wonder where you're coming from
When you roll in like thunder just to turn around and run
It's a good thing I don't need you to stay
You smell like moonlight and early morning rain
Pray tell a fool might surrender to your pain
Or find a cure for your decay
You're at your best with an ache in your chest
And that worn out old song that you play
Only Jesus and you long to teach us
Should no one be left to betray
I don't know the answer but I know who to blame
You can choose the dancer or you could choose the flame
I think you'll find they're one and the same
It doesn't have to be this way
You're at your best with an ache in your chest
And that worn out old song that you play
Only Jesus and you long to teach us
Should no one be left to betray
I don't know the answer but I know who to blame
Pray tell a fool might surrender to your pain
It's a good thing I don't need you to stay

I'm used to being alone
Except for six month flings with diamond rings
And phone bills that outweigh the phone
This is the life that I chose
I got no complaints if he is, if he ain't
And if he is, I guess he'll send me a rose

Just don't ask me for the truth if you choose to lie, honey
And don't try to open my door with your skeleton key
Some folks seem to think I only got one problem
I can't find nobody as crazy as me

I still love what I know
I love to ride alone and sing a song and listen to the radio
You can ride along
And if you change your mind, well, that's just fine
But there's something that you got to know

Just don't ask me for the truth if you choose to lie, honey
And don't try to open my door with your skeleton key
Some folks seem to think I only got one problem
I can't find nobody as crazy as me

You've closed a door in front of me
I wait patiently outside
And as the minutes tick away
I feel my anger rise
And who's the object of my rage?
And who's not being fair?
Is it you for your indifference?
Or me for just standing there?
'Cause in my mind the room beyond
Is bathed in golden light
Well I dream about you through the day
And I toss and turn at night
Sometimes it's hard to understand
When they say that pride's a sin
Should I go or should I stay
On the outside looking in?
Well I didn't make the grade today
And I'm not the only one
But my heart won't stop hurting
My feeling all alone
And maybe we'll trade places
In some not so distant year
I'll hear your voice a-calling out
And I'd cover up my ears
'Cause in my mind the room beyond
Is bathed in golden light
Well I dream about you through the day
And I toss and turn at night
Well sometimes it's hard to understand
When they say that pride's a sin
An' should I go or should I stay
On the outside looking in?
Well I could brag on the things I've done
Or the places I have been
But I've never found a cure
For on the outside looking in
Sometimes it's hard to understand
When they say that pride's a sin
Should I go or should I stay
On the outside looking in?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My father’s name was Hannibal, Mama was Hanna-Mariah
Everything we owned got all burned up in the great depression fire
Strip mines and one crop farming drained the green earth dry
We lost it all till only love was left, and that was the one thing money can’t buy
We’re all Dust Bowl Children
Singin’ the dust bowl song
Well, the crops won’t grow
And the dust just blows
When the green fields are gone
When the green grass growing fields are gone
When the green fields are gone
When the green grass growing fields are gone
Well, they said in California, there’s work of every kind
The only work that I got out there was waiting on a welfare line
Once I had a dollar, once I had a dream
Now all the work is being done by a big ole machine
We’re all Dust Bowl Children
Singin’ the dust bowl song
And the crops won’t grow
And the dust just blows
When the green fields are gone
When the green grass growing fields are gone
When the green fields are gone
When the green grass growing fields are goneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In this world I walk alone
With no place to call my home
But there's one who holds my hand
The rugged road through barren lands

The way is dark the road is steep
But He's become my eyes to see
The strength to climb my griefs to bear
The Savior lives inside me there

In Your love I find release
A haven from my unbelief
Take my life and let me be
A living prayer my God to Thee

In these trials of life I find
Another voice inside my mind
He comforts me and bids me live
Inside the love the Father gives

In Your love I find release
A haven from my unbelief
Take my life and let me be
A living prayer my God to Thee
Take my life and let me be
A living prayer my God to TheeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I grew up in the scantling yards of Wheeling West Virginia
A wheelhouse cub looking for an open door
In the packet ways a Sweeney wed the keel of my Bonita
Just two months from her timbers til she moored
I paid the fare in billet on her maiden voyage to Vicksburg
And talked my way to hand the tiller on the course
In her planks I carved a notch and sealed the vow “Be my Bonita”
And her dowry was my life between the shores
I was born with rouging ways, and she steered me like a woman
From the port calls and the bawds that lead me stray
The calliope serenades, made the old towns come running
And the boys would gamble shards to pull her chains
The striker’s boast would fain me loss, about the wrecks the shoals were keeping
And how the old girl’s got poor Billy’s ransom saved
On the lake at Bistineau, she set the wharf at Dixie
With a thousand bales of cotton on her main
As the Great Raft disappeared, the watermark went sinking
And she was stuck right hard, a listing on the bank
With the furnace still a blaze, I stood my last upon her
Then climbed the prow and took a landsman’s trade
“A derelict now Milady” said the watch log I’ve concorded
“Have the bosun sound us eight bells for the change”
Cause I was born with rouging ways, and she steered me like a woman
From the port calls and the bawds that lead me stray
The calliope serenades, made the old towns come running
And the boys would gamble shards to pull her chains
And I would take to widder walks, so the gin I stopped a drinking
At three scores aloft this crooked frame
The striker’s boast would fain me loss, about the wrecks the shoals were keeping
And how the old girl’s got poor Billy’s ransom savedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I lit my love and watched it burn
Asking nothing in return
Except the lessons I've been learned
Holding crazy faith
I've been touched by that bright fire
Down to the root of my desire
While the smoke, it rises higher
Holding crazy faith

You're not asking if I love this man
I know you don't, you don't believe you can
Yet I've seen love open like a dancer's fan
It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so
It tells me

Am I an old fool for hanging on?
Would I be a fool to be long gone?
When has daylight gone to dawn
Oh, my crazy faith
The questions will not let me sleep
Answers buried way too deep
At the bottom of our loveless game
Made by crazy faith
You're not asking if I love this man
I know you don't, you don't believe you can
Yet I've seen love open like a dancer's fan
It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so
It tells me


Love you lose and lose your love
Let the hope fly from the glove
And do not search the skies above
Search your crazy faith
Love is lightning, love is ice
It only strikes the lucky twice
Once so you will know the price
Once for crazy faith

You're not asking if love this man
I know you don't, you don't believe you can
Yet I've seen love open like a dancer's fan
It's crazy, I know, but my faith says soEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I've seen hard times and I've been told
There isn't any wonder that I fall
Why do we suffer, crossing off the years
There must be a reason for it all
I've trusted in You, Jesus, to save me from my sin
Heaven is the place I call my home
But I keep on getting caught up in this world I'm living in
And Your voice it sometimes fades before I know
Hurtin' brings my heart to You, crying with my need
Depending on Your love to carry me
The love that shed His blood for all the world to see
This must be the reason for it all
Hurtin' brings my heart to You, a fortress in the storm
When what I wrap my heart around is gone
I give my heart so easily to the ruler of this world
When the one who loves me most will give me all
In all the things that cause me pain You give me eyes to see
I do believe but help my unbelief
I've seen hard times and I've been told
There is a reason for it allEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Momma loved us, every one
Every daughter, every son
She gave herself so happily
That's just the way she was, you see
From dawn to dark she'd find a chore
And work it 'til it was no more
And every day until she died
In the evening, momma cried

Momma cried;
There was mourning in the evening
Momma cried;
'Cause her little girl was gone

Her little girl was snatched away
She was there and then just gone one day
And momma blamed herself, I'd say
But all of us had debts to pay

Momma cried;
There was mourning in the evening
Momma cried;
'Cause her little girl was gone
I did my best to cheer her pride
That day that something broke inside
I swore I'd find her and I'd try
In the evening, momma cried

I left home when I was seventeen
I just grew tired of falling down
And I'm sure I was told
The allure of the road would be all I found
And all the answers that I started with
Turned out questions in the end
So years roll on by
And just like the sky, the road never ends

And the people who love me still ask me
When are you coming back to town?
And I answer, quite frankly
When they stop building roads
And all God needs is gravity to hold me down


And the people who love me still ask me
When are you coming back to town?

And there ain't no more highways to be found

I'm drowning in a river of my tears
When all my will is gone you hold me sway
I need you at the dimming of the day

You pulled me like the moon pulls on the tide
You know just where I keep my better side

What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonny birds have wheeled away
I need you at the dimming of the day

Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confidant


Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confidant

Why don't you come and ease your mind with me
I'm living for the night we steal away
I need you at the dimming of the day
