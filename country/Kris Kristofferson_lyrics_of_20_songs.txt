Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin' for the trains
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans

I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time and
Bobby clappin' hands we finally sang up every song
That driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.

From the coalmines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me, Lord, through everythin' I done
Every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all she left for me
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Why me Lord?
What have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known?
Tell me, Lord
What did I ever do
That was worth lovin' you
Or the kindness you've shown?

Lord help me, Jesus
I've wasted it so help me, Jesus
I know what I am
But now that I know
That I've needed you so help me, Jesus
My soul's in your hand

Try me, Lord
If you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe, Lord
I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you
Lord help me, Jesus
I've wasted it so help me, Jesus
I know what I am
But now that I know
That I've needed you so help me, Jesus
My soul's in your hand
Lord help me, Jesus
I've wasted it so help me, Jesus
I know what I am
But now that I know
That I've needed you so help me, Jesus
My soul's in your hand

My soul's in your handEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

{Intro: Spoken}
I started writing a song about Chris Gentry and ended up writing about Dennis Hopper,  Johnny Cash... Norman, Norbert, Funky Donnie Fritts, Billy Swan, Bobby Neuwirth, Jerry Jeff Walker,  Paul Siebel…and Ramblin’ Jack Elliott had a lot to do with it
{Intro - Musical}

See him wasted on the sidewalk in his jacket and his jeans
Wearin' yesterday's misfortunes like a smile
Once he had a future full of money, love, and dreams
Which he spent like they was goin' outta style
And he keeps right on a-changin' for the better or the worse
Searchin' for a shrine, he's never found
Never knowin' if believin' is a blessin' or a curse
Or if the goin' up was worth the comin' down

He's a poet and he's a picker, he's a prophet and he's a pusher
He's a pilgrim and a preacher and a problem when he's stoned
He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction
Takin' every wrong direction on his lonely way back home

He has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your bars
And he's traded in tomorrow for today
Runnin' from his devils, Lord, and reachin' for the stars
And losin' all he's loved along the way
But if this world keeps right on turnin' for the better or the worse
And all he ever gets is older and around
From the rockin' of the cradle to the rollin' of the hearse
The goin' up was worth the comin' down
He's a poet and he's a picker, he's a prophet and he's a pusher
He's a pilgrim and a preacher and a problem when he's stoned
He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction
Takin' every wrong direction on his lonely way back home

There's a lot o' wrong directions on that lonely way back home1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled through my closet for my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
I'd smoked my brain the night before
On cigarettes and songs that I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at  a can that he was kickin'
Then I crossed the empty street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somehow, somewhere along the way
On the Sunday morning sidewalks
Wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city sidewalks
Sunday mornin' comin' down
In the park, I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl who he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the song that they were singin'
Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed through the canyons
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday
On the Sunday morning sidewalks
Wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
Makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city sidewalk
Sunday mornin' comin' down
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do

Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Lay it soft against my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early morning light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care what's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord, tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

I don't care what's right or wrong (Yes, I do!)
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord, tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight

{Intro}
Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on, and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowin' soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times
I'll get along; you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowin' soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times

Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul

The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dyin'
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

"Oh," she said, "Casey it's been so long since I've seen you"
"Here," she said, "just a kiss to make a body smile"
"See," she said, "I've put on new stockings just to please you"
"Lord," she said, "Casey can you only stay a while?"

Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for anything they can to keep from goin' home

Standin' in the corner, Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye
"Oh," she said, "I suppose you seldom think about me"
"Now," she said, "Now that you've a family of your own"
"Still," she said, "it's so blessed good to feel your body"
"Lord," she said, "Casey, it's a shame to be alone"4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

A couple of years back
I come across a great and wasted friend of mine in the hallway of a recording studio
And while he was reciting some poetry to me that he'd written
I saw that he was about a step away from dyin' and I couldn't help but wonder why
And the lines of this song occurred to me
I'm happy to say he's no longer wasted and he's got him a good woman
And I'd like to dedicate this to John and June
Who helped show me how to beat the devil

It was winter time in Nashville, down on music city row
And I was lookin' for a place to get myself out of the cold
To warm the frozen feelin' that was eatin' at my soul
Keep the chilly wind off my guitar
My thirsty wanted whisky, my hungry needed beans
But it'd been of month of paydays since I'd heard that eagle scream
So with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams
I left my pride and stepped inside a bar
Actually, I guess you'd call it a "tavern"
Cigarette smoke to the ceiling and sawdust on the floor
Friendly shadows

I saw that there was just one old man sittin' at the bar
And in the mirror I could see him checkin' me and my guitar
And he turned and said "Come up here boy, and show us what you are"
I said "I'm dry," and he bought me a beer
He nodded at my guitar and said "It's a tough life, ain't it?"
I just looked at him
He said, "You ain't makin' any money, are you?"
I said,  "You've been readin' my mail"
He just smiled and said "Let me see that guitar
"I've got something you oughta hear"
Then he laid it on me:
If you waste your time a-talkin'
To the people who don't listen
To the things that you are sayin'
Who do you think's gonna hear?
And if you should die explainin' how
The things that they complain about
Are things they could be changin'
Who do you think's gonna care?"
There were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind
Who were crucified for what they tried to show
And their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time
'Cause the truth remains that no one wants to know

Well, the old man was a stranger but I'd heard his song before
Back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door
When no one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor
And lonesome was more than a state of mind
You see, the devil haunts a hungry man
If you don't wanna join him, you got to beat him
I ain't sayin' I beat the devil
But I drank his beer for nothing
Then I stole his song

And you still can hear me singin'
To the people who don't listen
To the things that I am sayin'
Prayin' someone's gonna hear
And I guess I'll die explaining how
The things that they complain about
Are things they could be changin'
Hopin' someone's gonna care
I was born a lonely singer and I'm bound to die the same
But I've got to feed the hunger in my soul
And if I never have a nickel, I won't ever die ashamed
'Cause I don't believe that no one wants to know1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

{Intro}
I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the sky
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes

Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I've been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again

Coming close together with a feeling that I've never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman nor afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end

And loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again

Mmm, mmm

I was runnin' through the summer rain
Tryin' to catch the evenin' train
And kill that old familiar pain
Weavin' through my tangled brain
When I tipped my bottle back
I smacked into a cop I didn't see
That policeman said Mr. Cool
If you're ain't drunk then you're a fool
I said if that's against the law
Tell me why I never saw
A man locked in that jail of yours
Who wasn't just as lowdown poor as me
Well that was when someone turned out the lights
And I wound up in jail to spend the night
And dream of all the wine and lonely girls
In this best of all possible worlds
Well I woke up next morning
Feelin' like my head was gone
And like my thick old tongue
Was lickin' somethin' sick and wrong
And I told that man I'd sell my soul
For somethin' wet and cold as that old cell
That kindly jailer grinned at me
All eaten up with sympathy
Then poured himself another beer
And came and whispered in my ear
'If booze was just a dime a bottle
Boy, you couldn't even buy the smell'
I said I knew there was somethin' I liked about this town
But it takes more than that to bring me down down down
'Cause there's still a lot of wine and lonely girls
In this best of all possible worlds
Well they finally came and told me
They was a-gonna set me free
And I'd be leavin' town
If I knew what was good for me
I said it's nice to learn that
Everybody's so concerned about my health
I said I won't be leavin'
No more quicker than I can
'Cause I've enjoyed about as much of this
As I can stand
And I don't need this town of yours
More than I've never needed nothing else
'Cause there's still a lotta drinks that I ain't drunk
Lots of pretty thoughts that I ain't thunk oh yeah
Lord there's still so many lonely girls
In this best of all possible worlds1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The scene was a small roadside cafe
The waitress was sweeping the floor
Two truck-drivers drinkinf their coffee
And two Okie kids by the door
"How much are them candies?" they asked her
"How much have you got?" she replied
"We've only a penny between us."
"Them's two for a penny," she lied
And the daylight grew heavy with thunder
And the smell of the rain on the wind
Ain't it just like a human?
Here comes that rainbow again
One truckdriver called to the waitress
After the kids went outside
"Them candies ain't two for a penny."
"So what's it to you," she replied
In silence they finished their coffee
Got up and nodded goodbye
She called, "Hey, you left too much money."
"So what's it to you?" they replied
And the daylight grew heavy with thunder
And the smell of the rain on the wind
Ain't it just like a human?

Look who's advertising
Billboards everywhere
"see hellacious acres
Your tailor made nightmare"
Traffic is backed up for miles
Attendants welcome you with devilish smiles
Steady ... steady ...
Have your tickets ready
Steady ... steady ...
Go to hell
After dark
It's a sin filled city
An amusement park
It's a one way ticket to the other side
It's a dr. jekyll and a mr. hyde
See lizzie borden, she's one of the stars
And tricky dicky barkin'
Flashin' you his pardon
Jack the ripper slashin' your tires
Even the devil needs money
To cover his overhead
That's why he opened hellacious acres

Billy Dalton staggered on the sidewalk
Someone said he stumbled and he fell
Six squad cars came screaming to the rescue
Hauled old Billy Dalton off to jail

'Cause the law is for protection of the people
Rules are rules and any fool can see
We don't need no drunks like Billy Dalton
Scarin' decent folks like you and me

Homer Lee Hunnicut was nothing but a hippy
Walking through this world without a care
Then one day, six strapping brave policeman
Held down Homer Lee and cut his hair

We don't need no hairy-headed hippies

So thank your lucky stars you've got protection
Walk the line and never mind the cost
And don't wonder who them lawmen was protecting
When they nailed the savior to the cross

I took myself down to the Tally Ho Tavern
To buy me a bottle of beer
And I sat me down by a tender young maiden
Who's eyes were as dark as her hair
And as I was searching from bottle to bottle
For something un-foolish to say
That silver tongued devil just slipped from the shadows
And smilingly stole her away
I said: "Hey, little girl, don't you know he's the devil
He's everything that I ain't
Hiding intentions of evil
Under the smile of a saint
All he's good for is getting in trouble
And shiftin' his share of the blame
And some people swear he's my double:
And some even say we're the same"
But the silver-tongued devil's got nothing to lose
I'll only live 'til I die
We take our own chances and pay our own dues
The silver tongued devil and I
Like all the fair maidens who've laid down beside him
She knew in her heart that he'd lied
Nothin' that I could have said could have saved her
No matter how hard that she tried
'Cos she'll offer her charms to the darkness and danger
Of somethin' that she's never known
And open her arms at the smile of a stranger
Who'll love her and leave her alone
And you know, he's the devil
He's everything that I ain't
Hiding intentions of evil
Under the smile of a saint
All he's good for is getting in trouble
And shiftin' his share of the blame
And some people swear he's my double:
And some even say we're the same
But the silver-tongued devil's got nothing to lose
I'll only live 'til I die
We take our own chances and pay our own dues

Billy Dee was seventeen when he turned twenty-one
Fooling with some foolish things he could've left alone
But he had to try to satisfy a thirst he couldn't name
Driven toward the darkness by the devils in his veins
All around the honky-tonks, searching for a sign
Gettin' by on gettin' high on women, words and wine
Some folks called him crazy, Lord, and others called him free
But we just called us lucky for the love of Billy Dee
Busy goin' his own way and speakin' his own words
Facin' and forgettin' every warnin' that he heard
Makin' friends and takin' any crazy chance he could
Gettin' busted for the bad times and believin' in the good
Billy took a beatin' from a world he meant no harm
The score was written in the scars upon his arm
Some felt he was payin' for the life he tried to lead
But all we felt was sorry for our good friend Billy Dee
It may be his soul was bigger than a body's ought to be
Singin' songs and bringin' laughter to the likes of you and me
'Cause the world he saw was sadder than the one he hoped to find
But it wasn't near as lonesome as the one he left behind
Yesterday they found him on the floor of his hotel
Reachin' toward the needle, Lord, that drove him down to hell
Some folks called it suicide, others blame the speed
But we just called it crucified when Billy Dee O.D.'dEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

They're killing babies in the name of Freedom
We've been down that sorry road before
They let us hang around a little longer than they should have
And it's too late to fool us anymore
We've seen the ones who killed the ones with vision
Cold-blooded murder right before your eyes
Today they hold the power and the money and the guns
It's getting hard to listen to their lies

And I've just got to wonder what my Daddy would've done
If he'd seen the way they turned his dream around
I've got to go by what he told me, try to tell the truth

Killing farmers
Burning down schools full of children

She would meet me in the mornin', on my way down to the river
Waitin' patient by the Chinaberry tree
With her feet already dusty, from the pathway to the levee
And her little blue jeans rolled up to her knees

I'd pay her no attention, as she tagged along beside me
Tryin' hard to copy everything I did
But I couldn't keep from smilin' when I'd hear somebody sayin'
Looky yonder there goes Jody and the kid

Even after we grew older, we could still be seen together
As we walked along the levee holdin' hands
For as surely as the seasons, she was changin' to a woman
And I'd lived enough to call myself a man

And she often lay beside me, in the coolness of the evenin'
'Til the mornin' sun was shinin' on my bed
And at times when she was sleepin', I would smile when I'd remember
How they use to call us Jody and the kid

Now the world's a little older, and the years have changed the river
'Cause there's houses where they didn't used to be
And on Sundays, I go walkin' down the pathway to the levee
With another little girl who follows me
And it makes the old folks smile, to see her tag along beside me
Doin' little things the way her mama did
But it gets a little lonesome when I hear somebody sayin'
Looky yonder, there goes Jody and the kidEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

He's a giver, he'll give her
The kind of attention that she's never known
He's a teacher, he'll teacher her
To open the doors that she can't on her own
He's a lover, he'll love her
In ways that she never has been loved before
And he's a getter, he'll get her
By gettin' her into the world she's been hungryin' for
He's a charmer, and he'll charm her
With money and manners that I never learned
He's a leader, and he'll lead her
Across pretty bridges he's planning to burn
He's a talker, he'll talk her
Right off of her feet, but he won't talk for long
Cause he's a doer, and he'll do her
The way that I've never
And damned if he won't do her wrong
Cause he's a taker, he'll take her
To places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to
He'll take his time before takin' advantage
Takin' her easy and slow
And after he's taken the body and soul
That she gives him, he'll take her for granted
Then he'll take off and leave her
Takin' all of her pride as he goes
Cause he's a taker, he'll take her
To places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to
He'll take his time before takin' advantage
Takin' her easy and slow
And after he's taken the body and soul
That she gives him, he'll take her for granted

Watch closely now
Are you watching me now
Your eyes are like fingers
They're touchinq my body
And arousing my soul
Riding the passion arising inside me
How high, can I go?
You're comin' with me girl, I'm gonna show you how
When it's scary, don't look down
Watch closely now
Are you watching me now?
I see the hunger arise in your eyes
And it's urging me on
Higher and harder and faster and farther
Than I've ever gone
You're coming closer lady;
Don'tcha leave me now
We're gonna make it
Don't look down
Maybe I'm takin' me too many chances
With no net at all
Maybe I'll teach you at least that you've
Got to be free when you fall
Watch closely now
Are you watching me now?
I'm the master magician
Who's setting you free
From the lies you've been told
When they're breaking your back
Bring your last straw to me
I turn straw into gold
I'm gonna need you later
When you're not around
But I can take it
Don't look down
Watch closely now...
Are you watching me now?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
