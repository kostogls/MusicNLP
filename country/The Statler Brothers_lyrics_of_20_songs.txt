I keep hearing you're concerned about my happiness
But all the thought you're giving me is conscience, I guess
If I were walking in your shoes, I wouldn't worry none
While you and your friends are worrying 'bout me
I'm having lots of fun

Counting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playing solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothing to do

Last night I dressed in tails pretending I was on the town
As long as I can dream, it's hard to slow this swinger down
So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doing fine
You can always find me here and having quite a time

Counting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playing solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothing to do

It's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright
Anyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete
Counting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playing solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothing to do

Don't tell me I've nothing to do
Don't tell me I've nothing to do1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I woke up this morning feeling fine I woke up with heaven on my mind
I woke up with joy in my soul cause I knew my Lord had control
I knew I was walkin' in the light cause I'd been on my knees in the night
And I'd pray till the Lord gave a sign and now I'm feeling mighty fine
Well I'm feeling mighty fine I've got heaven on my mind
Don't you know I want to go where the milk and honey flow
There's a light that always shines down inside this heart of mine
I've got heaven on my mind and I'm feeling mighty fine
( piano )
We're walking with Jesus all the time we're walking and talking as we climb
We're traveling a road to the sky where I know I'll live when I die
He's been telling me all about that land and he tells me that everything is grand
And he says that a home will be mine and now I'm feeling mighty fine
Oh I'm feeling mighty fine...
Oh I'm feeling mighty fine...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She was called a scarlet woman by the people
Who would go to church but left me in the streets
With no parents of my own, I never had a home
And an eighteen-year-old boy has got to eat

She found me outside one Sunday morning
Begging money from a man I didn't know
She took me in and wiped away my childhood
A woman of the streets this lady Rose

This bed of Rose's that I lay on
Where I was taught to be a man
This bed of Rose's where I'm living
Is the only kind of life I'll understand

She was a handsome woman just thirty-five
Who was spoken to in town by very few
She managed a late evening business
Like most of the town wished they could do

And I learned all the things that a man should know
From a woman not approved of, I suppose
But she died knowing that I really loved her
Of life's bramble bush I picked a rose
This bed of Rose's that I lay on
Where I was taught to be a man
This bed of Rose's where I'm living
Is the only kind of life I'll understand

This bed of Rose's that I lay on
Where I was taught to be a man
This bed of Rose's where I'm living
Is the only kind of life I'll understand, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Here is a story
From the good book we know
A story 'bout a miracle
That happened long ago
We hope that you'll take courage
When temptation you meet
There's somebody watching you
Who's strong when you're weak
They wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knee to the idol made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the fourth man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn
Now the prophet Danial tells about
Three men who walked with God
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
Before the wicked king they stood
And the king demanded them
Bound and thrown
In the firey furnace that day
But the fire was so hot
That the men were slain
Who forced them on their way
Now when the few were thrown in
And the king rose up
To witness this awful fate
He began to tremble at what he saw
And in astonished tones he spake
Did we not cast three men bound
Into the midst of that fire
Well though I see four men unhurt
Unbound and walking down there
There's Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego
An' the fiery coals they trod
And the form of the fourth man
That I see is like the Son of God
They wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knee to the idol made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the fourth man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn
They wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knee to the idol made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the fourth man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn
They wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knee to the idol made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the fourth man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burnEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Tommy's selling used cars, Nancy's fixing hair
Harvey runs a grocery store and Margaret doesn't care
Jerry drives a truck for Sears and Charlotte's on the make
And Paul sells life insurance and part time real estate
Helen is a hostess, Frank works at the mill
Janet teaches grade school and prob'ly always will
Bob works for the city and Jack's in lab research
And Peggy plays organ at the Presbyterian Church
And the class of '57 had it's dreams
Oh We all thought we'd change the world with our great works and deeds
Or maybe we just thought the world would change to fit our needs
The class of '57 had dreams
Betty runs a trailer park, Jan sells Tupperware
Randy's on an insane ward and Mary's on welfare
Charlie took a job with Ford and Joe took Freddie's wife
Charlotte took a millionaire and Freddie took his life
John is big in cattle, Ray is deep in debt
Where Marvis finally wound up is anybody's bet
Linda married Sonny, Brenda married me
And the class of all of us is just a part of history
And the class of '57 had it's dreams
But living life day to day is never like it seems
Things get complicated when you get past eighteen
But the class of '57 had its dreams

She came to me shortly after Christmas
Said she hated spoiling New Year's Eve
But the truth doesn't wait to come in season
And what we had feared was now believed
She said she'd leave come Monday morning
Catch a plane if I'd split the fare
She had friends who lived in New York City
She'd look them up and have the baby there
And now she's alone in New York City (New York City)
Living like ... Lord, I wonder how
An angel in hell in New York City (New York City)
But I can't think about that now
Honey, will you tell him Bible stories
And give him all the love I never could?
And never tell him too much 'bout his daddy
'Cause there's not too much to say that's good
He'll have to learn it all from his mother:
How to count and say his A-B-C's
But when you teach him prayers to say at bedtime
Leave off "God bless Daddy," won't you please?
And now they're alone in New York City (New York City)
Living like ... Lord, I wonder how
Two angels in hell in New York City (New York City)
But I can't think about that now
I can't think about that now3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, we went out on a double date
Me and Edith, you and Kate
Before we got past their front gate
There you were making eyes at Edith
While you were making time with Kate
You can't have your Kate and Edith too
You rascal you yodel-a-dio
Then we went to a drive in a show
You were kissing on Kate, she wouldn't let you go
I looked at Edith started feeling bold
I found your big hairy hand holding on
To the hand I was trying to hold
You can't have your Kate and Edith too
You rascal you yodel-a-dio
Edith asked me if I would
Get her some popcorn, I said I would
When I got back dad-blame if you
Hadn't crawled into the backseat with
Kate and Edith was back there too
You can't have your Kate and Edith too
You rascal you yodel-a-dio
Years have passed since that first date
I married Edith, you married Kate
Now every night when I come home
Your car's in the driveway Kate's in the car
And you and Edith are in the house alone
You can't have your Kate and Edith too
You rascal you yodel-a-dio...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Saturday morning serials chapters 1 through 15
Fly paper, penny loafers, Lucky Strike Green
Flat tops, sock hops, Studebaker, Pepsi please
Ah, do you remember these?
Cigar bands on your hand, your daddy's socks rolled down
Sticks, no plugs and aviator caps with flaps that button down
Movie stars on Dixie Cup tops and knickers to your knees
Ah, do you remember these?
The hit parade, grape Tru-Aid, the Sadie Hawkins dance
Pedal pushers, duck tail hair, and peggin' your pants
Howdy-Doody, Tutti-Frutti, the seam up the back of her hose
Ah, do you remember those?
James Dean, he was keen, Sunday movies were taboo
The senior prom, Judy's mom, rock and roll was new
Cracker Jack prize, stars in your eyes, ask daddy for the keys
Ah, do you remember these?
The bogeyman, lemonade stand, and takin' your tonsils out
Indian burn and wait your turn and four foul balls you're out
Cigarette loads and secret codes and savin' lucky stars
Can you remember back that far?
To boat neck shirts and fender skirts and crinoline petticoats
Mum's the word and a dirty bird and a double root beer float
Moon hub caps and loud heel taps and he's a real gone cat
Ah, do you remember that?
Dancin' close, little moron jokes, and cooties in her hair
Captain Midnight, Ovaltine, and The Whip at the County Fair
Charles Atlas Course, Roy Roger's Horse, and only The Shadow knows
Ah, do you remember those?
Gable's charm, Frog in your arm, loud mufflers, pitchin' woo
Going steady, Veronica and Betty, white bucks, and Blue Suede Shoes
Knock Knock jokes: Who's there? Dewey. Dewey who?
Do we remember these? Yes we do. Ah, do we, do we remember theseEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, I ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
Ain't a-gonna need this house no more
Ain't got time to fix the shingles
Ain't got time to fix the floor
Ain't got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mingle the window panes
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
I'm a-gettin' ready to meet the saints

Well, this ole house once knew my children
This house once knew my wife
This ole house was home and comfort
As we fought the storms of life
This ole house once rang with laughter
This ole house heard many shouts
But now trembles in the darkness
When the lightnin' walks about

Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
Ain't a-gonna need this house no more
Ain't got time to fix the shingles
Ain't got time to fix the floor
Ain't got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mingle the window panes
Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
I'm a-gettin' ready to meet the saints

Now my old hound dog lies a-sleepin'
He don't know I'm gonna leave
Else he'd wake up by the fireplace
And he'd howl and moan and grieve
But my huntin' days are over
Ain't a-gonna hunt the coon no more
Gabriel just brought in my chariot
When the wind blew down the door

Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer
Ain't a-gonna need this house no more
Ain't got time to fix the shingles
Ain't got time to fix the floor
Ain't got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mingle the window panes

Everybody knows when you go to the show you can't take the kids along
You've gotta read the paper and know the code of GPG and R and X
And you gotta know what the movie's about before you even go
Tex Ritter's gone and Disney's dead and the screen is filled with sex
Whatever happened to Randolph Scott ridin' the train alone
Whatever happened to Gene and Tex and Roy and Rex the Durango Kid
Oh whatever happened to Randolph Scott his horse plain as could be
Whatever happened to Randolph Scott has happened to the best of me
( guitar )
Everybody's tryin' to make a comment about our doubts and fears
True Grit's the only movie I've really understood in years
You gotta take your analyst along to see if it's fit to see
Whatever happened to Randolph Scott has happened to the industry
Whatever happened to Johnny Mack Brown and Alan Rocky Lane
Whatever happened to Lash LaRue I'd love to see them again
Whatever happened to Smiley Burnette Tim Holt and Gene Autry
Whatever happened to all of these has happened to the best of me
Whatever happened to Randolph Scott has happened to the industryEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh Elizabeth, I want to see your pretty face
I want to touch your lips
I want to feel your warm embrace
Don't know if I could ever live my life without you
Oh Elizabeth, I'm sure missing you
I remember when we shared a life together
You gave me strength and love
With life that felt brand new
When you're so far away
I'd have to say I'm feeling blue
Oh Elizabeth, I'm sure missing you
Oh Elizabeth, I long to see your pretty face
I long to touch your lips
I long to feel your warm embrace
Don't know if I could ever live my life without you
Oh Elizabeth, I'm sure missing you
Well it's been said before
That I've caused many heartaches
And I wonder if that was really true
Being all alone feels my heart would surely break
Oh Elizabeth, I hope you understand
Oh Elizabeth, I want to see your pretty face
I want to touch your lips
I want to feel your warm embrace
Don't know if I could ever live my life without you
Oh Elizabeth, I'm sure missing you

I saw her from a distance
As she walked up to the wall
In her hand she held some flowers
As her tears began to fall
And she took out pen and paper
As to trace her memories
And she looked up to heaven
And the words she said were these...
She said Lord my boy was special
And he meant so much to me
And Oh I'd love to see him
Just one more time you see
All I have are the memories
And the moments to recall
So Lord could you tell him
He's more than a name on a wall..
She said he really missed the family
And being home on Christmas day
And he died for God and Country
In a place so far away
I remember just a little boy
Playing war since he was three
But Lord this time I know
He's not coming home to me
And she said Lord my boy was special
And he meant so much to me
And Oh I'd love to see him
But I know it just can't be
So I thank you for my memories
And the moments to recall
But Lord could you tell him
He's more than a name on a wall..

Never heard a snowman talking
Never seen a reindeer fly
Nor seen a wooden soldier walking
Nor met Santa eye to eye
Now there are those who don't believe
In miracles or Santa Claus
But I believe what I believe
And I believe in Santa's cause
Never heard an angel singing
Never known a Scrooge to smile
But I have heard sleigh bells ring
And light a spark in some small child
For kids and tress light up at Christmas
As well as preachers and our lawns
And light a Santa way at Christmas
I believe in Santa's cause
There's a Santa world at Christmas
Turning to the world's applause
So hang a bell for ole Saint Nick
'Cause I believe in Santa's cause
Now there are those who don't believe
In miracles or Santa Claus
But I believe what I believe
And I believe in Santa's causeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

That bed that I lay on is narrow and cold
This sickness inside me tears at my soul
And the devil awaits me, he calls me his son
For he knows I'm cornered and too weak to run
For I soon must return to my gutter of thrills
Where joy is the needle or a bottle of pills
Where a man welcomes misery like an old friend from home
That he uses and abuses till the misery is gone
My mind's filled with torture my body's in pain
But the needle is warm as it sinks in my vein
Just a matter of seconds then my mind will be free
From the coldness and darkness that dominate me
But the freedom is short lived and then I'm alone
I must find the pusher but my money's all gone
Then the cycle of horror starts over once more
Oh God let me suffer this misery no more...1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There were tears in the eyes of Jesus there were nails in the palms of his hands
There were thorns in his brow and only God could know how
Much pain he could withstand
There was blood all around the hillside as a mother mourned her loss
And we all stood to gain from the heavenly pain on the other side of the cross
On the other side of the cross the side that no one could see
On the spirit of things yet to come on the future of you and me
And what he gave that day on the cross not one bit of love has been lost
Hold my hand stand up and say if you were there on that day
On the other side of the cross...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Passed me by one summer day, flashed those big brown eyes my way
And oh, I wanted you forevermore
I'm not one that gets around, swear my feet's stuck to the ground
And though I never did meet you before
Hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
I saw your lips, I heard your voice, believe me I just had no choice
Wild horses couldn't make me stay away
I thought about a moonlit night, arms around you good an' tight
And thats all I had to see for me to say
Hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part

Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing power
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Are your garments spotless, are they white as snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Are you washed in the blood
In the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb
Are your garments spotless, are they white as snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Lay aside the garments that are stained with sin
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb
There's a fountain flowing for the soul unclean
Oh be washed in the blood of the Lamb
Are you washed in the blood
In the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb?
Are your garments spotless, are they white as snow?

I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in
And then a little light from Heaven filled my soul
He bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above
And just a little talk with Jesus made me whole
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry and we will answer by and by
Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning
You'll know a little fire is burning
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
I may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
Oh, I go to Him in prayer, He knows my every care
And just a little talk with Jesus gonna makes it right
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus
Let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry and we will answer by and by
Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning

There are people who are whispering
And the rumors are running wild
There's a woman who's not married
But she's gonna have a child
Her name is Mary, she's a virgin
From down in Nazareth, now listen close
She's gonna marry a man named Joseph
But the baby's father is The Holy Ghost
And who do you think could believe such a thing
Could believe that the story is true
And who do you think could believe such a thing
Well, here's hopin' to Heaven you do
Now there sayin' she had a baby
In a barn in Bethlehem
And the stars moved 'round the Heavens
Till it stopped right over them
Then some shepherds said
An Angel came and told them 'bout the birth
They always knew, men went to Heaven
But now God had come to Earth
And who do you think could believe such a thing
Could believe that the story is true
