The bottle's gettin' lower again my friend
And hard times are trying it's best to win
The bottle's gettin' lower again my friend
So let's get down loud and show the rebel within'
The bottle's gettin' lower again my friends
So do yourself a shot and lets start to sin
The bottle's gettin' lower again my friend
So let's light up a smoke and live hard till the end

Yeah i'll do it right and you can do it wrong
Just look out darling cause you know I'm cock strong
You can do me right and i'll do you wrong
Look out darling cause I'm showing you the rebel within'

I'm drunk, again
And stoned, again
Let's fuck, again
Till dawn, again

The more I try to keep on hangin' on, it makes me feel like i've lost Everything i've owned
Maybe it was all the hell I raised, or it might've been the whiskey That I drank for days
Was it cause I don't fit in, or maybe it was cause I had the devil as a Friend
Hell I know I never made momma proud, so let's live it up and you can shoot it down

I'm drunk, again
And stoned, again
Let's fuck, again
Till dawn, again
I'm drunk, again
And stoned, again
Let's fuck, I'm showing you the rebel within
(Rebel within')(2x)

The more I try to do right, it just seems wrong
I guess that's the curse of livin' out my songsBorn of bad blood since day number one
Hell I was worse off than a loaded gun
The life I leaded has always been fast and mean
But I never let the hard times make me weak

The bottle's gettin' lower again again my friend
So let's get down loud and show the rebel within'
And i'll do it right you can do it wrong
Just look out darlin' cause you know I'm cock strong
You can do me right and i'll do you wrong
Look out darlin' cause I'm showing you the rebel within'

I'm drunk, again
And stoned, again
Let's fuck, again
Till dawn, again
I'm drunk, again
And stoned, again
Let's fuck, again
Till dawn, again

Well, I was rollin by myself
Went down to Memphis, Tennessee
And I was lookin' for a guy who had a mullet and no teeth
And I was trippin on some acid
A latino gave to me
Hey, I was smokin morphine
Til it knocked me off my feet
Then I got some "H"
From my old Uncle Pete
Now I'm startin to feel
Like I might've ODed
On an overdose of drugs
Overdose of sin
I'm gonna live it to the fullest
Like I'm on ten
And I love gettin high
I hate bein low
And I like to drive my truck
Down a muddy dirt road
And I'm workin real hard
Tryin to get paid
Cause I'm a crazed country rebel
And I'm driftin state to state
Somehow I made it up to Texas
With a carload full of grass
And I'm seeing all these pigs
Who wanna bust my ass
And I'm always livin hard
Always smokin weed
Now I'm hangin out in Texas
Drinkin mushroom tea
And I'm fucked up on the floor
And I think I know why
Must've been some of that
Boone county moonshine
And an overdose of drugs
Overdose of sin
I'm gonna live it to the fullest
Like I'm on ten
And I love gettin high
I hate bein low
And I like to drive my truck
Down a muddy dirt road
And I'm workin real hard
Tryin to get paid
Cause I'm a crazed country rebel
And I'm driftin state to state
I tried to get up off the floor
Tried to get myself in line
Cause the ceiling's talkin to me
And the pisser's flushin fire
That's why they call me 'full throttle'
I like a good time
It all started at a bar
With a friend of mine
Well she had to hook me up
She said she'd blow my mind
I've been up for four days
So cut me out another line
Of an overdose of drugs
Overdose of sin
I'm gonna live it to the fullest
Like I'm on ten
I love bein high
I hate bein low
And I like to drive my truck
Down a muddy dirt road
And I'm workin real hard
Tryin to get paid
Cause I'm a crazed country rebel
And I'm driftin state to stateEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

3 shades of black is where I come from
Depression, Missery, and Hellacious fun
No we're not the kind to turn our backs and run
Coz 3 shades of black is where we come from
We are a certain breed and we dont like you
Some are junkies some are freaks and others are everyday ghouls
No one will ever know what we've been through
And we are proud in the light of the moon
3 shades of black
3 shades of black
We all like metal and Whiskey!
Livin' Hard and chasin' down Hell
We'll never give up on what we have because the darkness gives us our thrills
Yeaaaaaaahhhh! Yeeeeaaaahyeaaaaah!

I was born in the sacrafice when I was young

Well, oh, what a feelin' that burns down low
When you ain't got nowhere to turn or nowhere to go
It makes me feel like sometimes I'm outta control
So, I'm gonna get wasted with all my country heroes

And I'm drinkin' some George Jones and a little bit of Coe
Haggard's easin' my misery and Waylon's keepin' me from home
Hank's givin' me those high times, Cash is gonna sing it low
And I'm here gettin' wasted just like my country heroes

Hey, I'm drinkin' that whiskey out of that glass
And if that ain't country well, boys, you can kiss my ass
I wanna hear them old songs, nothin' of the new
'Cause this might be the last time I'm gonna see you

So, I'm drinkin' some George Jones and a little bit of Coe

Low down
Once again
Well I'm strugglin' now
To get by, my friend
It's keepin' me up
Late at night
I can't settle down
My honky-tonk life

Driftin' around 'bout half past four
With the blues on my back and a bottle on the floor
Drinkin' until I think I'm gonna fall down
'Cause my sweet little baby had to kick me low down (Low down)

Low down

Satan is real working in spirit
You can see him and hear him this world every day
Satan is real working with power
He can tempt you and lead you astray

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

Well, my worn out boots are takin' me downtown
An' I'm lookin' for trouble an' I wanna get loud
Serve me up a drink an' I'll shoot it right down
An' I'll jump up on the bar an' holler, "One more round."

I'm goin' straight to hell
Ain't nothin' slowin' me down
I'm goin' straight to hell
So you just better get me one more round

Well, back in the day with my Uncle Jim
He kept a lotta moonshine out in the shed
Taught me how to drink, how to be real proud
Of my hillbilly ways an' my outlaw style
I'm goin' straight to hell
Ain't nothin' slowin' me down
I'm goin' straight to hell
So you just better get me one more round


Well, I'm racin' these back roads tryin' to save my life
Cause the Sheriff wants to kill me cause I fucked his wife
I was on the run with a gun in my hand
Cause I liked a good time an' a one-night stand

I'm goin' straight to hell
Ain't nothin' slowin' me down
I'm goin' straight to hell
So you just better get me one more round

Country music singers
Have always been a real close family
But lately some of my kin folks
Have disowned a few others and me
I guess it's because
I kinda changed my direction
Lord I guess I went and broke the family tradition

Hank why do you drink?
Hank why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
If I'm down in a Honky-Tonk
Some ol' slicks tryin to give me friction
I'll say leave me alone
I'm singin' all night long
I'm just caryin' on an old family tradition

Lordy, I have loved some ladies
And I have loved Jim Beam
And they both tried to kill me
In 1973
When that doctor asked me
Son how did you get in this condition
I said hey sawbones I'm just carryin on
An old family tradition
Hank Why do you drink?
Hank why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
If I'm down in a Honky-Tonk
Some ol' slicks tryin to give mesome  friction

Well, hello there folks
How the hell are you doin
It's good to be in
Your local bar again
So let's get loud
We'll get stoned an get proud
Have a damn good time
Until the show's end
Sometimes I'm wired
An' sometimes, I'm tired
But I'm doin' the best that I can
So let's have a drink
And get drunk with Hank
An may the outlaws rise again
Well I'm a son of a son
I've got shit for what
I've said an done
Well, I remember watchin ol Waylon
When he was shootin his shotgun
It's a certain kinda livin
It's a certain kinda style
Not everybody likes us
But we we drive some folks wild
Well I think I'd rather eat the barrel
Of a double-barrel loaded shotgun
Than to hear that shit
They call pop-country music
On 98.1
Just so you know
So it's set in stone
Kid Rock don't come from
Where I come from:
Yeah, it's true, he's a Yank
He ain't no son of Hank
And if you thought so
Well god-damn, you're fucking dumb
So let's get real loud
Let's get stoned and proud
Pour me another shot of whiskey
An this one's for the south
It's a certain kinda livin
It's a certain kinda style
Not everybody likes us
But we we drive some folks wild

They're making lots of noise down in Texas
And I love that red flag of Tennessee
Drinkin' with the ghost of Mississippi
Flirtin' with old misery
I've broken that train in Alabama
And I've crossed more than one too many lines
Smell that weed deep in Louisiana
Makes that trouble in Texarkana seem so fine
And I've been railed up more than once in Carolina
How I love that sweet southern smell of Virginia's vagina
Ain't nothing like the wives of West Virginia
Or the howl of a Kentucky trail
That mud gets deep down in Florida
Hell it keeps me our of Arkansas jail
I love that big sky in Montana
Idaho's rivers are always cold as ice
By the time I get to California
The rowdy folks are always out of sight
And I've been railed up more than once in Carolina
Ain't nothing like the feel of Virginia's vagina
That Navajo nation brings the thunder
And Arizona burns you alive
Those roughnecks raise Hell in Houston
And Minnesota always blows my mind
I got buzzed one time in Indiana
Couldn't walk for two days in Lakeville
I've hung out with Hell in Pennsylvania
And only Tolleson knows the shape I'm in
And I've been railed up more than once in Carolina
Ain't nothin' like the feel of Virginia's vagina
They're makin' lots of noise down in Texas
And I love that red flag of Tennessee
Drinkin' with the ghost of Mississippi
And flirtin' with old misery
I've broken that train in Alabama
And I've crossed more than one too many lines
That Michigan madhouse makes me wonder
Am I walkin' on someone else's time?

Shoot my car if it don't crank
Try to raise a little Cain
Mess the walls up with some paint
Might even join a rodeo
Ride my horse to Buffalo
Change my name to Bill -

But I can't promise you I won't

Some people win, some people lose
Some people never get to choose
All you can do is the best you can
And hope things work out like you plan
I plan to stay but I might go
I can't say cause I don't know
I might become the president
And tell the world I'm heaven sent
Take up drinking cold iced tea
Quit watching women and tv
Might even smoke those cigarettes
Play my guitar like Dickey Betts
Get in miss Shania's pants -

But I ain't sayin' I won't try
To do it all before I die

Well, I can't sell my momma short on loving me
I guess that's why she let me go so far
Momma always stopped me short of stealing
I guess that's why I had to steal that car
She told me not to smoke it
But I did and it took me far away
And I turned out to be
The only hell mama ever raised
I pulled into Atlanta, stolen tags and almost out of gas
I had to get some money, and lately I'd learned how to get it fast
Those neon lights was calling me and somehow I had to get downtown
I reached into the glovebox, another liquor store went down
And I sing "Precious Memories," take me back to the good ol' days
I can hear my momma singing, "Rock of Ages" cleft for me
She tried to turn me on to Jesus, but I turned on to the devil's ways
And I turned out to be the only hell my momma ever raised
When they put those handcuffs on me, Lord how I fought to resist
But that agent clamped 'em tighter, 'til that metal bit into my wrist
They took my boots and my billfold, my fingerprints, and the profile of my face
Then they locked away the only hell my momma ever ever raised
And I sing "Precious Memories," take me back to the good ol' days
I can hear my momma singing, "Rock of Ages" cleft for me
She tried to turn me on to Jesus, but I turned on to the devil's ways

And thats why drinkin ain't hard to do
I-85 to my favorite place
They call Country Box
They got dancin and drinkin
And them outlaw girls that'll make your heart stop
Half past three and I dont wanna leave
Cause my home life is misery
A honkytonk dive is where i'd rather be
Cause theres a bar stool
Waitin right there for me
Drinkin ain't hard to do
When you're workin all the time
And ain't got nothin new
It'll drive you crazy like you're goin insane
Tryin to get ahead in this hard world today
Then all the pressure starts gettin to you
And that's why, drinkin ain't hard to do
I-85 to my favorite place
They call Country Box
They got dancin and drinkin
And them outlaw girls that'll
Make your heart stop
Half past three and I dont wanna leave cause my home life is misery
Hell a honkytonk dive
Is where I'd rather be
Cause theres a bar stool
Waitin right there for me
Yea a honkytonk dive
Is where I'd rather be
Cause theres a bar stool
Waitin right there for meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
