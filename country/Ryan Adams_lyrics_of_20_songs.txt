Free my heart
Somebody locked it up
Still waiting on parole
I can taste the freedom just outside that door
Same grey walls
Same grey clothes
Mmm, I know my friends all know
Can't keep it under control

I know our love is wrong
I am a criminal
Mmm, I am a prisoner
Mmm, I am a prisoner
For your love

There's this one bird
Lands on the sill beside the bars
How can something born with wings
Ever know freedom to truly be free
Clock don't know what your memories do
They're stacking up beside the bed
I count 'em every night inside my head
If loving you is wrong
I am a criminal
Mmm, I am a prisoner
Mmm, I am a prisoner
If loving you is wrong
I am a criminal
Mmm, I am a prisoner
Mmm, I am a prisoner
For your loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's so hard to be without you
Lying in the bed, you are so much to be without
Rattles in my head that empty drum filled with doubt
Everything you lose, the wisdom will find its way out
Every night is lonesome and is longer than before
Nothing really matters anymore

It's so hard to be without you
Used to feel so angry, and now I only feel humble
Stinging from the storm inside my ribs where it thunders
Nothing left to say or really even wonder
We are like a book and every page is so torn
Nothing really matters anymore

It's so hard not to call you
Thunders in my bones out in the streets where I first saw you
When everything was new and colorful, it's gotten darker
Every day's a lesson, things were brighter before
Nothing really matters anymore

It's so hard to be without you
Everyday I find another little thread of silver
Waiting for me when I wake some place on the pillow
And then I see the empty space beside me and remember
I feel empty, I feel tired, I feel worn
Nothing really matters anymoreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When they call your name
Will you walk right up
With a smile on your face?
Will you cower in fear?
In your favorite sweater
With an old love letter

I wish you would
I wish you would

Come pick me up
Take me out
Fuck me up
Steal my records
Screw all my friends
They're all full of shit
With a smile on your face
And then do it again
I wish you would

When you're walking down town
Do you wish I was there?
Do you wish it was me?
With the windows clear
And the mannequins eyes
Do they all look like mine?
You know you could
I wish you would

Come pick me up
Take me out
Fuck me up
Steal my records
Screw all my friends
Behind my back
With a smile on your face
And then do it again
I wish you would

I wish you'd make up my bed
So I could make up my mind
Try it for sleeping instead
Maybe you'll rest sometime
I wish I could
I wish I could
I wish I could4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I been thinking about you, baby
Been on my mind
Why can't I feel your love?
Heart must be blind
What can I say?
I didn't want it to change
But in my mind, it's all so strange

Do you still love me, babe?
Do you still love me, babe?
Do you still love me? Oh-oh

Another year will pass
I will count the days
Another sun goes down
And I'll never see the rays
What can I say?
I didn't want it to change
Is my heart blind and our love so strange?

Do you still love me, babe?
Do you still love me, babe?
Do you still love me? Oh-oh

Do you still love me, babe?
Do you still love me, babe?
Do you still love me? Oh-oh1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Midnight coming, I can feel it in the air
I hear your voice, run your fingers through my hair
I reach out for your hand but I know it isn't there
I pick up my phone and I shiver and I stare

Morning coming early every day
I can barely sleep, I been lying here awake
I close my eyes, I see you with some guy
Laughing like you never even knew I was alive

Maybe I'm a fool, doesn't matter anyway
My chest is all tight, my heart still aches
These are the days you need double what it takes
I've missed you so much I shiver and I shake
I've missed you so much I shiver and I shake

I've been waiting here like a dog at the door
You used to throw me scraps, you don’t do that anymore
I miss your loving touch, I miss your embrace
But if I wait here any longer I'm gonna fade away
If I wait here any longer I'll just fade awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I could wait a thousand years, my love
I'd wait for you
I could stand in just one place, my love
And never move

As the fire burns around us in the dark
One part is the world and one's my heart

My love, we can do better than this
My love, how can you complicate a kiss?
My love, you'd love me now 'til doomsday comes
'Til doomsday comes

Can you stand and face your fears, my love?
I will for you
I could stand in just one place, my love
And never move

As the fire burns around us in the dark
One part is the world and one's my heart
My love, we can do better than this
My love, how can you complicate a kiss?
My love, I'd love you now 'til doomsday comes

My love, oh, and I don't know
My love, how to let my feelings go
You said you'd love me now 'til doomsday comes

'Til doomsday comes
'Til doomsday conesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Dancing where the stars go blue
Dancing where the evening fell
Dancing in your wooden shoes
In a wedding gown

Dancing out on 7th street
Dancing through the underground
Dancing little marionette
Are you happy now?

Where do you go when you're lonely
Where do you go when you're blue
Where do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue

Laughing with your pretty mouth
Laughing with your broken eyes
Laughing with your lover's tongue
In a lullaby
Where do you go when you're lonely
Where do you go when you're blue
Where do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Midnight, you come and pick me up with no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view
It's been a while since I even heard from you
I should just tell you you should leave
I know exactly where it leads
Watch us go around, 'round each time

You've got that Daydream Nation look in your eye
I got that pent up love thing that you like
And we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style

So it goes, I can't keep my eyes on the road
She takes me home, lights are off, she's taking off her coat
I say "I've heard that you've been out and about with someone new, someone new, someone new"
She says "What you heard is true
I can't stop thinking about you"
And I've been there far too many times

You've got that Daydream Nation look in your eye
I got that pent up love thing that you like
And we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long brown hair thing that I like
You've got that good girl faith thing, ass so tight
And we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I went down to Houston and I stopped in San Antone
I passed up the station for the bus
I was trying to find me something
But I wasn't sure just what
Man I ended up with pockets full of dust
So I went on to Cleveland and I ended up insane
I bought a borrowed suit and learned to dance
And I was spending money like the way it likes to rain
Man I ended up with pockets full of cane

Oh my sweet Carolina
What compels me to go
Oh my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home

I ain't never been to Vegas but I gambled up my life
Building newsprint boats I race to sewer mains
Trying to find me something but I wasn't sure just what
Funny how they say that some things never change

Oh my sweet Carolina
What compels me to go
Oh my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home

Up here in the city it feels like things are closing in
The sunset's just my light bulb burning out
I miss Kentucky and I miss my family
All the sweetest winds they blow across the south

Oh my sweet Carolina
What compels me to go
Oh my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home
May you one day carry me home1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Strong winds and my head's on fire
Walk another day across the high wire
I'm on a tightrope, watch it as it swings
Like a countdown ticker on New Year's Eve

We run the numbers spinning in the side
Counting all the reasons that we're broken and we lied
I'm on a tightrope, watch it as it heaves
Heating up the metal, putting pressure on the springs

All I want is for you to make me smile
All I want is for you to drive me wild

Pretty candles on a birthday cake
Covered in confetti with the caffeine shakes
Fuck all the money, everything is trash
Papers in the glove box, light it up and pass

Flip on the tube, we watch it 'til we sleep
Ain't nothing but static and the panics and the feeling manic
I'm on a tightrope, watch it as it swings
Like a countdown ticker on New Year's Eve
And all I want is for you to make me smile
All I want is for you to drive me wild
All I want is for you to make me smile
All I want is for you to drive me wild
Wild


All I want is for you to make me smile
All I want is for you to drive me wild

How am I supposed to know
When it's time to go
In the middle of the night
When I'm all alone
Don't know what to do
Don't know what I'm even supposed to say
Like a train don’t move
‘Til it starts to roll away

The cars don't move in the middle of the night
Lost inside the void of the fading tail lights
I swear I wasn't lonely when I met you, girl
But I was so bored, I was so bored
I don't know anything anymore

I got this achin' in my chest
Rollin' around like a pile of bones
In a broken little box
It sounds a lot like you
Laughing to yourself
In a quiet room
Our eyes knowing more than they probably ought to
The cars don't move in the middle of the night
Lost inside the void of the fading tail lights
I swear I wasn't lonely when I met you, girl
But I was so bored, I was so bored
I was so sure, I was so bored
I was so bored, I was so bored
I don't know anything anymore

The walls are all cracked
The fan stutters in the room
Where we slept
Where I woke up next to you
Sometimes a man don't know
When he's got to walk away
I hear a rumbling and a moan
I feel like an outbound train

The cars don't move in the middle of the night
Lost inside the void of the fading tail lights
I swear I wasn't lonely when I met you, girl
But I was so bored, I was so bored
I was so sure, I was so bored, I was so bored
I was so sure, I was so sure
I was so sure
I was so sure
I was so sure
I was so sure
I don't know anything anymoreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Young boy, done me bad, I went and did you wrong
And I got high, Lord, I got high
And I got a bone to pick with you
And I'm sure you know its true

Oh, one day when you're looking back
You were young, and man, you were sad
When you're young, you get sad
When you're young, you get sad, then you get high
Oh, man

Young gal, done you bad, and I went and did you wrong
Young gal, you done me bad, so I went and did you wrong
And I got high, Lord, I got high
Now you got a bone to pick with me
But I wish you'd let me be

Oh, one day when you're looking back
You were young, and man, you were sad
When you're young, you get sad
When you're young, you get sad, then you get high
You get high
Ooh, the days the rain would fall your way
Ooh, the days the rain would fall your way

Then you'd be high, 'cause you got sad

Welcome to my haunted house
I live here alone, ain't no one else
It's the last house at the end of the block
My friends all disappeared one by one

The cracks in the windows and the spiders, they crawl
Across the lattice from 1924
Life is too sweet, yeah, and life is too short
And there's nowhere to fall

And I don't want to live in this haunted house anymore
I don't want to live in this haunted house anymore

There's a painting on the wall
I see its eyes watching me as I walk on down the hall
Nobody stops to write, nobody calls
My friends all disappear
They all got lost

The cracks in the window and the spiders, they crawl
Across the lattice from 1924
Life is too sweet, man, and life is too short
And there's nowhere to fall
And I don't want to live in this haunted house anymore
I don't want to live in this haunted house anymore

If I lie to you
Will you still be mine?
I want you to stay
Tell me when it's OK
If I'm tired as I'm blue
Could you still be mine?
When the summer fades
And the autumn turns to grey
Can you hold me?
Can you hold on one more day or two?
Baby I love you
If I cry to you
Can you hold me still?
I don't want any more tears
I'm just broken from the years
If I lie to you
Cuz the truth might sting
Is it better to know
What's worse than letting go
Pressing the bruise to watch it grow
Baby please don't go
All you need
What you need
What you need is love
Is love
Is love
You're better off imagining a heaven above
If I lie to you
Would you still be mine?
When the winter strays
And the ice has melted away
I will try for you
If you'll still be mine
I just want you to know
I'll never let you go
I will never let you go
I'll never let you go away
Away
Away

Two hearts fading, like a flower
And all this waiting, for the power
For some answer, to this fire
Sinking slowly, the waters higher

Mmm, Desire
Desire

With no secrets, no obsession
This time I'm speeding, with no direction
Without a reason, what is this fire?
Burning slowly, my one and only

Mmm, Desire
Desire
Desire
Desire

You know me, you know my way
You just can't show me, but God I'm praying
That you'll find me, and that you'll see me
That you'll run and never tire
Mmm, Desire

Thorn in my side
Pain I can't hide
Diamonds that won't shine
Oh, my soul, black as coal

Feel like I'm headed for a breakdown
Feel like I'm headed for a breakdown
Feel like I'm racing and I can't come down
Feel like I'm headed for a breakdown

God, did he cry
Tears that don't dry
Tomorrow will come and it'll be alright
Oh, my soul lost control

Feel like I'm headed for a breakdown
Feel like I'm headed for a breakdown
Feel like I'm racing and I can't come down
Feel like I'm headed for a breakdown

Was I dreaming did I lose something in, in the night?
Did I lose you? Did I lose you?
Maybe I'm sleeping and in the morning I will only see the sunshine
Did I lose you? Did I lose my mind?
Feels like I'm headed for a breakdown
Feels like I'm headed for a breakdown
Feels like I'm racing and I can't come down

I've come to you from broken things
I've crawled to you on my hands and knees
Sailed to you across the seven seas
If only to hear you say my name
I've come to you from broken times
I've showed you my face with no disguise
My memories a mirror without eyes
If only to take away your pain
If only to hear you say my name

Hear the whisper in the rising wind
Empty and so cold, too dark for the birds to fly in
And they're lined up on the wall
And as I'm walking by, they scatter and take off
I watch them as they rise into the sun
If only you believed you were the one
When the day is new the light is warm
Upon the bed the curtain is drawn and torn
The shadows forming, falling just behind
If only you believed all of my lies
Hanging in my heart just like a flag
When I'm lazy in the wind, the colors sag
As the clouds go rolling off the hill
Can't tell where the rooves begin and end
No more will I know my home again
Hear the whisper of the rising wind
Empty and so cold too dark for the birds to fly in
They're lined up on the wall
As I'm walking by they scatter and take off
Watch them as they rise into the sun
If only you believed you were the one
If only you believed you were the one
If only you believed you were the one1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Crush it up into a paper ball, let it fly
It hits the wall, hits the trash can on the side
Crush it up into a paper ball, let it go
Anything I ever had to say, it's all gone

Anything I say to you now is just a lie
Anything I say to you now but goodbye
Anything I say to you now is just a lie
But goodbye
But goodbye

Crush it up and let it go to waste, it's not working
Sit and wait for somebody to tell you it's almost done
Crush it up into a paper ball, it's just words
Words that never really added up to much else 

Anything I say to you now is just a lie
Anything I say to you now is just a lie
Anything I say to you now, anything I say to you now
Anything I say to you now but goodbye

Listen, I ain't got nothing for you
But a bag of tricks and a broken noose
Nobody hangs around that's got something to lose
If I was born to be the loner, okay
But I'm not made of stone
And I'm so blown away
Don't know what's the rubble
And the parts I want to save

We disappear and we fade away
We disappear

Maybe tomorrow the sun will shine
But the moon is full and what's on my mind
Is like a bad commercial in the movie of my life
Was I alone, am I still?
Nobody gets in, nobody ever will
You deserve a future and you know I'll never change

We disappear and we fade away
We disappear
A beggar's cough, so musical and blind
Must've crossed the railways 'til he lost his mind
Hard to tell the difference, didn't matter anyway

We disappear and we fade away
We disappear

Broken mirror and my hand starts to bleed
Wish I could explain but it hurts to breathe
Didn't fit in my chest so I wore it on my sleeve

We disappear, we disappear
We disappear, we disappearEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The problem is what we want to say
What we want to say will just blow us both away
It's ice cold and it just rained
Everything we were is going down in an endless drain

It was broken anyway
It was broken anyway
It was broken, it was fake
I just close my eyes and shake

Last chance before it slips away
Throw it all away and can't go back again
What was whatever it became?
Whatever, we will still be together in some ways

It was broken anyway
It was broken anyway
It was broken anyway
It was broken anyway
It was broken anyway
It was broken, it was fake
And I don't know what it meant
It was broken anyway
It was broken anyway
It was broken anyway
