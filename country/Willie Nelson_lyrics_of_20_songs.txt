Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone

This big ol' world sure got me running 'round
I heard a voice that said, "Just settle down"
And with the moonlight as my guide
And with this feeling deep inside
I know now that I am homeward bound

Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone


Desert roads, desert plains
I have seen so much pain
Now I see into the eyes of a girl
No more, no more, cruel world
Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone


Dusty trail, saw vapor light
Was it a mirage? I don't know, but it seemed right
I felt mission, I felt trust
I knew then that I must
Must go to her from this cruel world

Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone


Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

On the road again -
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again
And I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again -
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way
Is on the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way
Is on the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again

Now, many many years ago
When I was twenty three
I was married to a widow
Who was pretty as could be
This widow had a grown-up daughter
Had hair of red
My father fell in love with her
And soon the two were wed
This made my dad my son-in-law
And changed my very life
My daughter was my mother
Because she was my father's wife
To complicate the matters
Even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father
Of a bouncing baby boy
My little baby then became
A brother-in-law to dad
And so became my uncle
Though it made me very sad
For if he was my uncle
That also made him the brother
Of the widow's grown-up daughter
Who, of course, was my step-mother
I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa

My father's wife then had a son
That kept them on the run
And he became my grandchild
For he was my daughter's son
My wife is now my mother's mother
And it makes me blue
Because, she is my wife
She's my grandmother too

I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa

Now, if my wife is my grandmother
Then, I am her grandchild
And every time I think of it
It nearly drives me wild
For now I have become
The strangest case you ever saw
As the husband of my grandmother
I am my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In the twilight glow I see them
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
And through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand-in-hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Now my hair has turned to silver
All my life I've loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven
Blue eyes crying in the rain2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Laugh with me, buddy, jest with me, buddy
Don't let her get the best of me, buddy
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely

If I ever needed you, buddy
You know now I really do, buddy
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely

I cry at the least, little thing, buddy
And I'll die if you mention her name, buddy

Talk to me, buddy, stay with me, buddy
Let's don't let her get away with it, buddy
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely

Let's talk about things as they were, buddy
Before I got mixed up with her, buddy

Laugh with me, buddy, jest with me, buddy
Let's don't let her get the best of me, buddy
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When you lose the one you love
You think your world has ended
You think your world will be a waste of life
Without them in it
You feel there's no way to go on
Life is just a sad, sad song
But love is bigger than us all
The end is not the end at all
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not ours to be taken
It's just a thing we get to do
Life goes on and on
And when it's gone
It lives in someone new
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not ours to be taken
It's just a thing we get to do
Life goes on and on
And when it's gone
It lives in someone new
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get throughEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

And you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your
Sweet love hasn't died
And give me
Give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

At a time when the world seems to be spinnin'
Hopelessly out of control
There's deceivers, and believers, and old in-betweeners
That seem to have no place to go

Well, it's the same old song, it's right and it's wrong
And living is just something that I do
And with no place to hide, I looked in your eyes
And I found myself in you

I looked to the stars
Tried all of the bars
And I've nearly gone up in smoke
Now my hand's on the wheel
I've something that's real
And I feel like I'm going home

And in the shade of an oak down by the river
Sat an old man and a boy
Setting sail, spinning tales and fishing for whales
With a lady they both enjoy
Well, it's the same damn tune
It's the man in the moon
It's the way that I feel about you
And with no place to hide
I looked in your eyes
And I found myself in you

And I looked to the stars
Tried all of the bars
And I've nearly gone up in smoke
Now my hand's on the wheel
I've something that's real
And I feel like I'm going homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

He looked down into her brown eyes
And said "Say a prayer for me"
She threw her arms around him
Whispered "God will keep us free"
They could hear the riders coming
He said "This is my last fight
If they take me back to Texas
They won't take me back alive"

There were seven Spanish angels
At the altar of the sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the valley of the gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home

She reached down and picked the gun up
That lay smoking in his hand
She said, "Father please forgive me
I can't make it without my man"
And she knew the gun was empty
And she knew she couldn't win
Her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again
There were seven Spanish angels
At the altar of the sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the valley of the gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home

There were seven Spanish angels
At the alter of the sun
They were praying for the lovers

Come on Willie, help me with this thing

There were seven Spanish angels
At the Altar of the Sun (Oh I believe)
They were praying for the lovers (Yeah they was)
In the Valley of the Gun (Well, well, well)
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne (Oh, yeah)
And seven Spanish angels
Took another Angel homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there

Well, you can't make a record if you ain't got nothing to say

Made a lot of money selling sheets on the family plan

The red-headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana
Rode into town one day
And under his knees was a raging black stallion
And walking behind was a bay
The red-headed stranger had eyes like thunder
And his lips, they were sad and tight
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
And his heart was heavy as night

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait 'til tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

A yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window
And watched as he passed her way
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay
But how could she know that this dancing bay pony
Meant more to him than life?
For this was the horse that his little lost darling
Had ridden when she was his wife
Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

The yellow-haired lady came down to the tavern
And looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink and he gave her some money
He just didn't seem to care
She followed him out as he saddled his stallion
And laughed as she grabbed at the bay
He shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say

"Don't cross him, don't boss him
"He's wild in his sorrow
"He's riding and hiding his pain
"Don't fight him, don't spite him
"Just wait 'til tomorrow
"Maybe he'll ride on again"
The yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset
The stranger went free, of course
For you can't hang a man for killing a woman
Who's trying to steal your horse
This is the tale of the red headed stranger
And if he should pass your way
Stay out of the path of the raging black stallion
And don't lay a hand on the bay

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It was the time of the preacher
When the story began
With the choice of a lady
And the love of a man
How he loved her so dearly
He went out of his mind
When she left him for someone
That she'd left behind
He cried like a baby
He screamed like a panther
In the middle of the night
And he saddled his pony
He went for a ride
It was the time of the preacher
In the year of '01
Now the preachin' is over
And the lesson's begun

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely nights dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
Beside the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
A paradise where roses bloom

Though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain
Though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain
Though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrainEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas
There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend
And a small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes
No, a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men
And I believe to my soul that inside every man there's the feminine
And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear
Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out
And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper
And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead
So when you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister
You can't fuck with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
What did you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every lady there's a cowboy who wants to come out
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Blue birds singing a song
Nothing but blue skies from now on

I never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly by
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on

And then someday, you'd leave me for somebody new

Wondering what in the world did I do?

It's been rough and rocky traveling
But I'm finally standing upright on the ground
After taking several readings
I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound

I guess Nashville was the roughest
But I know I've said the same about them all
We received our education
In the cities of the nation, me and Paul

Almost busted in Laredo
But for reasons that I'd rather not disclose
But if you're staying in a motel there and leave
Just don't leave nothing in your clothes
And at the airport in Milwaukee
They refused to let us board the plane at all
They said we looked suspicious
But I believe they like to pick on me and Paul

It's been rough and rocky traveling
But I'm finally standing upright on the ground
After taking several readings
I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound
I guess Nashville was the roughest
But I know I've said the same about them all
We received our education
In the cities of the nation, me and Paul

On a package show in Buffalo
With us and Kitty Wells and Charlie Pride
The show was long and we're just sitting there
And we'd come to play and not just for the ride
Well, we drank a lot of whiskey
So I don't know if we went on that night at all
But I don't think they even missed us
I guess Buffalo ain't geared for me and Paul

It's been rough and rocky traveling
But I'm finally standing upright on the ground
After taking several readings
I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound

I guess Nashville was the roughest
But I know I've said the same about them all

I don't wanna be the last man standin'
Or wait a minute maybe I do
If you don't mind I'll start a new line
And decide after thinkin' it through
Go on in front if you're in such a hurry
Like heaven ain't waitin' for you
I don't wanna be the last man standin'

It's gettin' hard to watch my pals check out
Cuts like a wore out knife
One thing I learned about runnin' the road
Is forever don't apply to life
Waylon and Ray and Merle and old Norro
Lived just as fast as me
I still got a lotta good friends left

Maybe we'll all meet again
On the other side
We'll pick and sing
Load up the buses and ride
