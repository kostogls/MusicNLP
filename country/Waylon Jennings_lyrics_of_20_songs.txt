I'm for law and order
The way that it should be
This song's about the night they spent
Protecting you from me
Someone called us outlaws
In some old magazine
New York sent a posse down
Like I ain't never seen

Don't you think this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand?
What started out to be a joke
The law don't understand
Was it singing through my nose
That got me busted by the man?
This ain't it, this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand
Out of hand
Out of hand

We were wrapped up in the music
That's why we never saw
The cars pull up, the boys get out
And the room fill up with law
They came pounding through the back door
In the middle of my song
They got me for possession
Of something that was long gone
Don't you think this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand?
What started out to be a joke
The law don't understand
Was it singing through my nose
That got me busted by the man?
This ain't it, this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand
Out of hand
Out of hand2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Lord, it's the same old tune, fiddle and guitar
Where do we take it from here?
Rhinestone suits and new shiny cars
It's been the same way for years
We need to change

Somebody told me, when I came to Nashville
"Son, you finally got it made!
Old Hank made it here, we're all sure that you will"
But I don't think Hank done it this way, no
I don't think Hank done it this way, ok


Ten years on the road, making one night stands
Speeding my young life away
Tell me one more time, just so's I'll understand
Are you sure Hank done it this way?
Did old Hank really do it this a-way?

Lord, I've seen the world with a five-piece band
Looking at the back side of me
Singing my songs, and one of his now and then
But I don't think Hank done 'em this way, no
I don't think Hank done 'em this way
Take it home

I've always been crazy and the trouble that it's put me through
Been busted for things that I did, and I didn't do
I can't say I'm proud of all of the things that I've done
But I can say I've never intentionally hurt anyone
I've always been different with one foot over the line
Winding up somewhere one step ahead or behind
It ain't been so easy but I guess I shouldn't complain
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane
Beautiful lady are you sure that you understand
The chances your taking loving a free living man
Are you really sure you really want what you see
Be careful of something that's just what you want it to be
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane
Nobody knows if it's something to bless or to blame
So far I ain't found a rhyme or a reason to change
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

A long time forgotten
Our dreams had just fell by the way
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's livin' today
But she never complains of the bad times
Or bad things he's done
Lord, she just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come

She's a good hearted woman
In love with a good timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter
They'll pass through this world, hand in hand
A good hearted woman
Lovin' her good timin' man

He likes the night life and bright lights
And good timin' friends
When the party's all over
She'll welcome him back home again
Lord knows she don't understand him
But she does the best that she can
'Cause she's a good hearted woman
She loves her good timin' man
She's a good hearted woman
In love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his wicked ways
That she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter
They'll pass through this world, hand in hand
A good hearted woman
Lovin' her good timin' man

She's a good hearted woman
In love with a good timin' man
She loves me in spite of my wicked ways
That she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter
We'll pass through this world, hand in hand, love
A good hearted woman
Lovin' her good timin' man2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, I woke up this mornin' it was drizzlin' rain
Around the curve come a passenger train
Heard somebody yodel and a hobo moan
Jimmy he's dead, he's been a long time gone
Been a long time gone, a long time gone
If you want to get to heaven, gotta D-I-E
You gotta put on your coat and T-I-E
Want to get the rabbit out of the L-O-G
You gotta make a commotion like D-O-G
Like D-O-G, like D-O-G, yeah
Well, I got a good woman, what's the matter with me?
What makes me want to love every woman I see?
I was trifling when I met her now I'm trifling again
And every woman she sees looks like the place I came in
Looks like the place I came in place I came in
I got my name painted on my shirt
I ain't no ordinary dude
I don't have to work
I don't have to workEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Low down leavin' sun
I've done did everything that needs done
Woe is me, why can't i see
I'd best be leavin' well enough alone
Them neon light nights, couldn't stay out of fights
Keep a-hauntin' me in memories
Well, there's one in every crowd, for cryin' out loud
Why was it always turnin' out to be me

Where does it go, the good Lord only knows
It seems like it was just the other day
I was down at Green Gables, a hawkin' them tables
And generally blowin' all my hard earned pay
Piano roll blues, danced holes in my shoes
There weren't another other way to be
For lovable losers, no account boozers
And honky tonk heroes like me

Way down in Virginia
Amongst the tall grown sugar canes
Lived a simple man and a dominicker hen
And a rose of a different name
Well, the first time I felt lightning
I was standing in the drizzling rain
With a trembling hand and a bottle of gin
And a rose of a different name

Well, the devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple-headed man
And help me leave that black rose alone

When the devil made that woman
Lord, he threw the pattern away
She was built for speed
With the tools you need
To make a new fool every day
Way down deep and dirty
On the darker side of shame
I caught a cane cuttin' man and a bottle of gin
With a rose of a different name
Well, the devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple-headed man
And help me leave that black rose alone
Well, the devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple-headed man
And help me leave that black rose aloneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Three fingers whiskey pleasures the drinkers
And moving does more than the same thing for me
Willy he tells me that doers and thinkers
Say moving is the closest thing to being free
Well he's rosined his riggings and laid back his wages
He's dead set on ridin' the big rodeo
My woman's tight with an overdue baby
And Willy keeps yelling, "Hey, Gypsy, let's go"

Willy, you're wild as a Texas Blue Norther
Ready rolled from the same makings as me
Well, I reckon we're gonna ramble 'til Hell freezes over
Willy the wandering Gypsy and me

Now, ladies, we surely will take of your favors
And we'll surely warn you there never will be
A single soul living that could put brand or handle
On Willy the wandering Gypsy and me
We'll dance on the mountains, shout in the canyons
And swarm in a loose herd like wild buffalo
Jammin' our heads full of figures and angles
And tellin' us stuff that we already know
Willy, you're wild as a Blue Texas Norther
Ready rolled from the same makings as me
Well, I reckon we're gonna ramble 'til Hell freezes over
Willy the wandering Gypsy and me

Hey, Willy, you're wild as a Texas Blue Norther

Oh Polly Oh Polly its for your sake alone
I have left my old Father, my Country, my home
I have left my old Mother to weep and to mourn
I am a rebel soldier, and far from my home
The grape shot and musket and the cannons lumber lie
Its many a mangled body the blanket for the shroud
Its many a mangled body left on the fields alone
I am a rebel soldier and far from my home
Here is a good old cup of brandy and a glass of wine
You can drink to your true love and I will drink to mine
You can drink to your true love and I will lament and moan
I am a rebel soldier and far from my home
I will build me a castle on some green mountain high
Where I can see Polly when she is passing by
Where I can see Polly and help her to mourn
I am a rebel soldier and far from my homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I looked for trouble and I found it, son
Straight down the barrel of a lawman's gun
I tried to run but I don't think I can
"You make one move and you're a dead man, friend"
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back
Then left me reeling on a steel rail rack
They got 'em all in the jailhouse, baby
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

Grew up in Houston off of Wayside Drive
Son of a carhop and some all night dive
Dad drove a stock car to an early death
All I remember was a drunk man's breath
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

You know the story how the wheel goes 'round
Don't let them take you to the man downtown
Can't sleep at all in a jailhouse baby
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

I live with Angel, she's a roadhouse queen
Makes Texas Ruby look like Sandra Dee
I want to love her but I don't know how
I'm at the bottom of the jailhouse now
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

You know the story about the jailhouse rock
Don't want to do it, but just don't get caught
They got 'em all in the jailhouse baby
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Long ago and far away
In my ol' common labor shoes
I turned the world all which a way
Just because you asked me to
Like unto no other feel
Simple love is simple true
There's no end to what I'd do
Just because you asked me to
Let the world call me a fool
But if things are right with me and you
That's all that matters
And I'll do anything you asked me to
Knowing how much I love you
And after all that I've been through
I'd turn and walk away from you
Just because you asked me to
(Lord. I hope you'll never do.)
Let the world call me a fool
But if things are right with me and you
That's all that matters
And I'll do anything you asked me toEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

On a Greyhound bus
Lord, I'm traveling this morning
I'm going to Shreveport
And down to New Orleans
Been traveling these highways
Been doing things my way
It's been making me lonesome, on'ry, and mean

Now her hair was jet black
And her name was Codeine
She thought she was the cream
Of the Basin Street Queens
She got tired of that smoky wine dream
Began to feel lonesome, on'ry, and mean


We got together
And we cashed in our sweeps
Gave 'em to a beggar
Who was mumblin' through the streets
There's no escaping from his snowy white dreams
Born lookin' lonesome, on'ry, and mean
Now I'm down in this valley
Where the wheels turn so low
At dawn I pray
To the Lord of my soul
I say, Dear Lord, do right by me
You know I'm tired of being lonesome, on'ry, and meanEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Willie, we've been constant companions
You know the light and shade
We have spent a million dollars
To find out what we made
We have made the maidens marvel
The things we do and say
Down, down and out, brother
Up, up and away

If you see me gettin' smaller, I'm leavin'
Don't be grieving
Just got to get away from here
If you see me gettin' smaller, don't worry
I'm in no hurry
I've got the right to disappear

God bless old Philadelphia
They were standing in the rain
Out in front of the Main Point
A wet and lonely train
Who knows who they came to see
A mad man full of beer
A four piece band and a charter bus

Just a good old boys
Never meanin' no harm
Beats all you never saw
Been in trouble with the law since the day they was born
Straightening the curves, yeah
Flattenin' the hills
Someday the mountain might get 'em but the law never will

Makin' their way the only way they know how
That's just a little bit more than the law will allow

Makin' their way the only way they know how (Yeah)
That's just a little bit more than the law will allow

You know my mama loves me
But she don't understand

Down through New Orleans
Yes I have
I've played in California
There ain't too much I haven't seen
No there ain't
Lord, I'm a ramblin' man
Don't fool around with a ramblin' man
Left a girl in West Virginia
Up there where that green grass grows
Yes I did
Got a girl in Cincinatti
Waitin' where the Ohio River flows
Oh, girl
I'm a ramblin' man
Don't give your heart to a ramblin' man
You better move away
You're standing too close to the flame
Once I mess with your mind
Your little  heart won't be the same
But I'm a ramblin' man
Don't mess around with and ol' ramblin' man
You better not
Well, up in Chicago
I was known as quite a boy
Yes I was
Down in Alabama
They call me the man of joy
Still do
Well, I'm a ramblin' man

You better move away

If you're in a valley, with a troubled mind
I'm a mountain, come on and climb
Because you look so good, to be so down
It won't take much girl, to turn it all around

Come with me, come with me
The feeling's free, just come with me
We'll get on a cloud, babe, and ride it high
Say "Hello sun", as we sail by

I'll take you where you've never been before
Once we're there, you'll cry for more
If it's dark in your world, come walk in mine
My love's a light babe, it's on all the time

Come with me, come with me
The feeling's free, just come with me
We'll get on a cloud, girl, and ride it high
Say "Hello sun", as we sail by

Won't you come with me, come with me

Everybody knows you've been stepping on my toes
And I'm getting pretty tired of it
You keep a' stepping out of line
And a' messing with my mind
If you had any sense you'd quit

'Cause ever since you were a little bitty teeny girl
You said I was the only man in this whole world
Now you better do some thinking then you'll find
You got the only daddy that'll walk the line

I keep a' working every day all you want to is play
I'm tired of staying out all night
I'mma coming unglued
From your funny little moods
Now Honey baby that ain't right

'Cause ever since you were a little bitty teeny girl
You said I was the only man in this whole world
Now you better do some thinking then you'll find
You got the only daddy that'll walk the line
You keep a' packing up my clothes nearly everybody knows
That you're still just a' putting me on
But when I start a' walking
Gonna' hear you start a' squawking
And a' begging me to come back home

'Cause ever since you were a little bitty teeny girl
You said I was the only man in this whole world
Now you better do some thinking then you'll find
You got the only daddy that'll walk the line

I've held it all inward, God knows I've tried
But it's an awful awakenin' in a country boy's life
To look in the mirror in total surprise
At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes

Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
