I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If it wasn't known, that our love will carry on
I will be the wind that echo's on the canyon wall
One more day with you, to walk around our neighbourhood
We will never know like it was understood

We never say goodbye
Just let me hold the light

If you've given up, I will call an end to this
I will be your rock from our perch
If you walk the ridge, you will find the marks, the scars
Kneel down by the tree, under the city stone

We never say goodbye
Just let me hold the light
We never say goodbye
I'll see you on this side
Or the other way
The desert sun kisses the sky
Baby hold the light
And keep it in your eyes
And promise that you dream with me
Beyond the walls of time
And when we laid aside
Just look up at the light
Just let me hold the light
Just let me hold the light1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Half your life you struggle
Half your life you fly
Half your life makin' trouble
Half your life makin' it right
One day I'm the exception
Most days I'm just like most
Some days I'm headed in the right direction
And some days I ain't even close

I'm a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man

I always loved the highway
I just don't run it as fast
I still go wherever the wind blows me
But I always find my way back
I still don't get it right sometimes
I just don't get it as wrong
I still go a little bit crazy sometimes
Yeah, but now I don't stay near as long
I'm a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn, burn, burning man
Just a burning man
Woo!

Maybe I'll go to the desert
Find myself in the Joshua Tree
If we pass in the night then just hand me a light
And tell me you burned just like me

I'm a little bit steady but still a little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn, burn, burning man
Just a burning man

This mornin' I got up at 6:01
I walked out and saw the rising sun
And I drank it in like whiskey
I saw a tree I've seen a thousand times
A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind
And it hit me
It's a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

I went back in and fired the coffee up
She walked in the kitchen like she always does
In my t-shirt and it killed me
And I kissed her like it was the first time
She laughed and looked at me like I'd lost my mind
I said "Baby, I love you, can't live without you, I know I don't say it enough"
Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

Like you never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missing
Some days you're living
It'a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

Some days you start singin'
And you don't need a reason
Sometimes the world's just right
Your clear eyes ain't even blinkin'
Got a heart full of grateful
For all you've been given
Some days you just get by
Yeah some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'
Livin' like you'll never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missin'
Some days you're living

The moon outside
Too bright
Those blinds, yeah, let's just keep 'em closed, you know
My hands, they know where to go
To find your finger tips
Trace 'em back to your lips
Take you on a trip
Flip that switch

Make my world go black
Hit me like a heart attack
Knock me flat on my back, yeah, just keep doing that
That thing you're doing there
Brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black, black

Black like a sky with no stars

Oh oh oh oh ohhhhhh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

I'd lose my way and I'd lose my mind
If I faced one day on my own
I know I was saved
The night that she gave this drifter's heart a home

Every night I should be on my knees
Lord knows how lucky I am
I'll never say near enough
Thank God for this woman, amen

Oh oh oh oh ohhhhhh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohhhh

This world has a way of shaking your faith
I've been broken again and again
But I need all the cracks in my shattered heart
'Cause that's where her love gets in
Every night I should be on my knees
Lord knows how lucky I am
I'll never say near enough
Thank God for this woman, amen

She gives me faith (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me grace (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me hope (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me strength (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me love (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
Love without end (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
Thank God for this woman, amen (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)

Oh oh oh oh ohhhhhh oh

Thanks for the moon and the stars up above
Forgiveness of sin in Your undying love
Every twist every turn for the way You made sure
All my roads led to her
So tonight I will fall down on my knees
'Cause Lord knows how lucky I am
I'm gonna shout at the top of my lungs
Thank God for this woman, amen
And thank God for this woman, amen

She gives me faith (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me grace (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)
She gives me hope (Oh oh oh oh ohhhh)

Bet you think I'm sitting at home, naw
Bet you think that I'm all alone, naw
I bet you think I'm missing you and wishing you would call my phone
Hell naw
I went wheels up on a runway
And that ticket was a one-way

I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body, and she's naughty
And she got me like you ain't never got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach

Heard you called my boys
Heard you called my folks
They said you drove by my house real slow
You can check any spot, roll down every road
But girl, I ain't even close
I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong
Got a new girl, she got it going on

She don't throw any t-shirt on and walk to a bar
She don't text her friends and say, "I gotta get laid tonight."
She don't say, "It's okay, I never loved him anyway."
She don't scroll through her phone just looking for a Band-Aid

It's different for girls when their hearts get broke
They can't tape it back together with a whiskey and Coke
They don't take someone home and act like it's nothing
They can't just switch it off every time they feel something
A guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
Fast forward through the pain, pushing back when the tears come on
But it's different for girls

She don't sleep all day and leave the house a wreck
She don't have the luxury to let herself go
(She won't call just to curse
Found a wall she can punch
When the going gets tough, yeah, the guys they can just act tough)

Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinking?
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinking?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking?
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing
What was I thinking?
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

When a mountain of a man with a "born to kill" tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-sliding like Bo Duke
What was I thinking?
I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sitting on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinking, oh what was I thinking, oh what was I thinking
Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again... cause I was

Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My buddies think I'm on the lake
Boss thinks I've been sick for days
And mama's probably on her way
'Cause I ain't picked up the phone

I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way
Without leaving my living room
I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
Yeah, I've been gone

All the clothes are on the floor
All the mail's by the door
All the whiskey bottles in my bed
All the dishes in the sink
All the gas is in the tank
All the neighbors probably think I'm dead

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

Well I bet my soul on a six string gamble
And I climb like hell through the brush and the bramble
Even though I had my doubts, told myself don't look down
And I turned that hill into a pile of gravel

It was only a mountain, nothing but a big ol' rock
Only a mountain, it ain't hard if you don't stop
It just took a little step, a right then a left
Then a couple million more, who's counting?
Yeah, that's only a mountain

Well you better know the bottom if you wanna be a climber
'Cause there's always another one a little bit higher
Just when I think I'm finally done I'm staring at another one
So I reach down deep and I lace 'em up tighter

It was only a mountain, nothing but a big ol' rock
Only a mountain, it ain't hard if you don't stop
It just took a little step, a right then a left
Then a couple million more, who's counting?
Yeah, that's only a mountain
Now I'm standing at the top with the sweat behind me
Yeah, you gotta look up if you ever wanna find me

It was only a mountain, nothing but a big ol' rock
Only a mountain, it ain't hard if you don't stop
It just took a little step, a right then a left
Now I'm standing at the top just shouting
Yeah, that's only a mountain

It's just an old beat up truck
Some say that I should trade up
Now that I got some jangle in my pocket
But what they don’t understand
Is it's the miles that make a man
I wouldn’t trade that thing in for a rocket
What they don’t know is my dad and me–
We drove her out to Tennessee
And she’s still here and now he’s gone
So I hold on

It's just an old beat up box
Its rusty strings across the top
It probably don’t look like much to you
But these dents and scratches in the wood
Yeah, that’s what makes it sound so good
To me it's better than brand new
You see this here flat top guitar
Has had my back in a million bars
Singing every country song
So I hold on

To the things I believe in
My faith, your love, our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah, I hold on, I hold on
Like the stripes to the flag
Like a boy to his dad
I can't change who I am, right or wrong
So I hold on
Yeah, baby, looking at you right now
There ain't never been no doubt
Without you I'd be nothing
So if you ever worry about
Me walking out
Yeah, let me tell you something
I hold on
I hold on
Can you hear me, baby?
I hold on
Yeah

Woke up this mornin' with my cellphone ringin'
She said, "I know that when you called me, you were drinking
But I loved every single word you left on my phone
And I know you're hung-over but I'm comin' on over"
Did I say we'd go shoppin', That I'd Louis Vuitton her
That I'd Rodeo Drive her, Slide a Tiffany diamond on her

What the hell did I say
When I called last night
Drippin' words of whiskey honey
In that message that she liked
What the hell did I say
Gotta dial it up again
Un-blackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say

Last thing I remember, I was thinking I'd call her up and
Put her on speaker while the whole bar sang Free Bird
Had that phone in my hand when I ran into trouble
My friend comin' over with a couple of doubles

What the hell did I say
When I called last night
Drippin' words of whiskey honey
In that message that she liked
What the hell did I say
Gotta dial it up again
Un-blackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say
Did I say we'd go shoppin', That I'd Louis Vuitton her
That I'd Rodeo Drive her, Slide a Tiffany diamond on her?
Did I tell her she could move in and we'd fly out to Vegas
Champagne all the way and we'd get married by Elvis

What the hell did I say
When I called last night
Drippin' words of whiskey honey
In that message that she liked
What the hell did I say
Gotta dial it up again
Un-blackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say
What the hell did I, hell did I, hell did I say

What the hell did I say?
What the hell did I say?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Lay your pretty head down on my shoulder
You don’t have to worry anymore
This old world is cold and getting colder
And I know how to lock and bolt the door
I’m strong enough to hold you through the winter
Mean enough to stare your demons down
The hard times put the shine into the diamond
I won’t let that keep us in the ground

I'm a riser
I'm a get off of the ground, don't run and hider
Pushing comes to shove
Hey, I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
A get out aliver of the fire
Survivor

If we ain't got no money, I can make it
And I ain't afraid of working to the bone
When I don’t know what I'm doing, I can fake it
I'll pray 'til jesus rolls away the stone

I'm a riser
I'm a get off of the ground, don't run and hider
Pushing comes to shove
Hey, I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
A get out aliver of the fire
Survivor
I'm a trier
I'm a get down low so I can lift you higher
An army couldn’t keep down my desire
Yeah

I'm a riser
I'm a get off of the ground, don't run and hider
Pushing comes to shove
Hey, I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
A get out aliver of the fire

West, on a plane bound west
I see her stretching out below
Land, blessed mother land
The place where I was born
Scars, yeah she’s got her scars
Sometimes it starts to worry me
Cause lose, I don’t wanna lose
Sight of who we are

From the mountains high
To the wave crashed coast
There’s a way to find
Better days I know

It’s been a long hard ride
Got a ways to go
But this is still the place
That we all call home

Free, nothing feels like free
Though it sometimes means we don’t get along
Cause same, no we're not the same
But that’s what makes us strong
From the mountains high
To the wave crashed coast
There’s a way to find
Better days I know

It’s been a long hard ride
Got a ways to go
But this is still the place
That we all call home

Brave, gotta call it brave
To chase that dream across the sea
Names, and they signed their names
For something they believed
Red, how the blood ran red
And we laid our dead in sacred ground
Just think, wonder what they think
If they could see us now

It’s been a long hard ride
Got a ways to go
But this is still the place
That we all call home
It’s been a long hard ride
And I won’t lose hope
This is still the place
That we all call homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
