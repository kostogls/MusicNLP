Like a rainy Sunday mornin'
Makes me wanna stay in bed twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs

Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah, I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell

You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
You make it easy7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin', man, y'all ain't listening
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missing
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

I sit back and think about them good ol' days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends

Chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride
Yeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
That's right34EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She had a shiny little Beamer with the ragtop down
Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barkin' and a-waggin' around
And I just laughed and said "Y'all get in"

She had on a new dress and she'd curled her hair
She was lookin' too good not to go somewhere
Said what you want to do, baby, I don't care
We can go to the show, or we can stay right here

And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancin' and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house
Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but, baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Just let me dust off the seat
Put your pretty little arms around me, hell yeah


You can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town or baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Oh, yeah
We can go to town
Or we can go another round
On my big green tractor13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Love how you close your eyes when I pull you in closer
Tonight's movin' fast but we ain't takin' it slower
You hit me harder than a drink does
You're gonna take me all the way up
Something about you baby, got me goin' crazy
I don't know what to do

I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
An' I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you

Love how you say my name and make it sound so sexy
Love how you do that thing, yeah you know what gets me
I'm talkin' slow motion all night long
Baby, love you with the lights on

I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top

You slip your finger through the tear in my t-shirt
You stirrin' up dirty in the back of my mind
You keep on flirtin', 'cause you know that it's workin'
You stuck in my head girl writing the lines
Couldn't sing this song without you if I tried
Let's light it up like it's our last night

We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down

Girl when you want it
You know that I'm on it
You know that I love lovin' up on you
Let's hit the switch and let our shadows dance
And light it up like it's our last chance
We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here dreamin' in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down

I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me (with me)
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me (against me)
I wanna rock it all night

All the folks down in Lynchburg, Tennessee
Been working hard for good ol' boys like me
I don't wanna be the one to tell 'em
That stuff that they've been selling
Ain't working like it should
But I damn sure wish it would

Whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

Maybe it's the bar or the stool I'm on
Maybe it's the band and the sad old song
That keeps me buying rounds
That keeps me turning down
Any girl that wants to dance
And you ain't giving them a chance

Whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey
Girl, I'm living proof that 80 proof
Ain't got a shot at touching you

But whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey
Yeah the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

Wiped the footprints off my dash
Tore up those sun-faded photographs
Threw 'em in the wind, ya'll can have it back
I'm outta here
I stuck my middle finger up in the sky
Flipped off that "ya'll come back" sign
Looked in the mirror one last time
And watched it disappear

It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

I could tough it out, but what's the use?
A place that small, it's hard to do
Too much of her to run into
And so much road to somewhere new
It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

It ain't nothin' but yesterday
One less truck rollin' down Main
Ain't nothin' left to say

It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

She said, "Baby, do you ever miss bein' alone?"

You're perfect for me

When you're talkin' like that, girl?"
Ain't no second thoughts, no regrets, no kinda maybe

Girl, just kiss me

I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth you gotta go straight to the source

Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far
But fillin' in all these blanks you left isn't all that hard
No, I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with
I guess you didn't hurt me half as bad as you think you did

Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool
Yeah, you think I'm down and out, hidin' out, hell-bent crazy
But that ain't me, baby

Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
But I'm a long way from broke down
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home

You boys ever met a real country girl
Talkin', true blue, out in the woods, down home, country girl

She's a hot little number in her pickup truck
Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party all nighter from South Carolina
A bad mamajama from down in Alabama
She's a ragin' cajun, a lunatic from Brunswick
Juicy Georgia peach with a thick southern drawl
Sexy swing and walk, brother, she's all

Country (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain’t afraid to stay
Country
Brother, she's country

A hell raisin' sugar when the sun goes down
Mama taught her how to rip up the town
Honey drippin' honey from the holler in Kentucky
Get you flippin', kinda trippy like a Mississippi hippie
She's a Kansas princess
Crazy mother trucker, undercover lover
Thick southern drawl, sexy swing and walk
Brother, she's all
Country, (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain’t afraid to stay
Country
Nothin' but country

(Thick southern drawl)
(Sexy swing and walk)
(Aw, show 'em how a country girl does it one time now)


Brother, she's country
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
Nothin' but country
Yeah, yeah-ah
She's country (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots

From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised

Country
Yeah, she's nothin' but country
She's all about the country
From the backwoods, she's a homegrown, down to the bone

Tell 'em all I'm on vacation
Say I went to visit friends
That you ain't heard or seen from me in quite a while
When they ask you where I've been
Tell 'em I'm out on the West Coast
Where it don't ever rain
And that I'm probably doing fine

Just don't tell 'em I've gone crazy
That I'm still strung out over you
Tell 'em anything you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth

Tell 'em all I'm out in Vegas
Blowing every dollar I ever made
Tell 'em that I must be into something bad for me

Living like a gypsy king

Just don't tell 'em all the truth

These fields don't grow overnight, this town wasn't built in a day
I'll be turnin' that dirt when the sun comes up
Goin' round in circles while that plane you're on takes you away
Chasin' down that sun in L.A, 2000 miles it ain't that far

Find your way back, I'll pray you do

The August rain, the break of dawn
Like anything worth countin' on
Comin' through, I'll wait for you

I'll keep the light on on the porch, I'll keep the key under the mat
Just in case I'm out there somewhere tryin' not to lose my mind
When you come back I know you gotta go
And if you don't girl you'll never know
And if you can't find what you want out there
I'll be right here, ain't goin' nowhere

Seat back and I'm curvin' swervin'
With my pedal to the metal like I'm racin'
Turn it up and let the speakers scream for Mr. Aldean but I call him Jason
Reminiscin' on the good times
Water balloons, super soakers
Wet t-shirts, women in bikinis
Kenny Rogers, penny loafers
Smoke blowin' out the window
And all my problems aside (aside)
Just feel that summer breeze
Lay back, kick it and enjoy the ride, Luda

I’ll throw some money down if you want to slip out
You’ve got me locked in, take my hand
Come be my queen, sitting up in my King Ranch
Bet you’d look good on a two lane back road
Bare feet on the dash, hand out the window

I want to ride all night, you sitting to my right
Till we get tomorrow shining in the headlights
I want to show you around this little farm town
Find some places that we can’t be found, girl
Just wanna take my time, just you and me baby
I wanna ride all night

If this keeps going good
I’m gonna make a little stop down by the creek
Lay you down in my truck bed
Steal another kiss before we drive off

Waiting on that sun to go down
Whatcha say I pick you up after work
Slide over, we slip out to the outskirts of town

I got a blanket and a fifth of Comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
It’s supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like I’m going to have to hold you tight, yeah

About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train

Yeah, I hope it’s gonna be a long one
And if we’re lucky, it’s moving slow
I wouldn’t mind if it lasted all night

I worked all week
Cleaned up clean cut and clean shaved
I got the cover off the '68
I fire it up and let them horses sing
A little pretty thing
A little tan-legged Georgia dream
She’s a rocking them holey jeans
Baby what you got going on Saturday?
You know words got it there’s gonna be a party
Out of town about half a mile
Four wheel drives and big mud tires
Muscadine wine

Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party

If you wanna drink
Go baby just do your thing
Give up your keys
Hell why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after while we’ll sneak away from the bonfire
Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside
Gotcha sipping on some moonshine
Baby if you're in the mood you can settle for a one night rodeo
You can be my tan-legged Juliet
I’ll be your Redneck Romeo
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace

They boarding up this water town
Ain't nobody hanging around
Another grey September day
Was I crazy to think she'd stay

If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
Just a little bit, yeah, just a little bit longer
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet on the beach
Instead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in, like a warm southern whisper on her (on her)
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
If only I, had a little more summertime

I brace myself against the cold
And let her memory take hold
Stirring that old fire up
As if I don't miss her enough

If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
Just a little bit, yeah, just a little bit longer (longer)
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet on the beach
Instead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in, like a warm southern whisper on her (on her)
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
If only I, had a little more summertime
Just a little more summertime
If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
Just a little bit, yeah, just a little bit longer (longer)
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
If only I, had a little more summertime1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I ain't gonna lie, girl
I know sometimes I can be crazy
But I can see it in your eyes
I'm the only guy that's driving you wild, so wild
Call it what you wanna but you know I wanna call you my lady
All this on and off and on again
And I wish you would make up your mind
'Cause it's time

And I'm tired of playing these games
Yeah you say that it's over
And then you tell me come over
It's like fire, and then it's like rain
Yeah we're hot and we're colder
You get me drunk and then sober
Tell me it's on if you want it to be
If you're moving on, then I think you should leave
I'm tired of playing these games, so I won't
Baby, love me or don't

I could keep your little red dress that you left on the floor, girl
Hang it in the closet 'cause I know you're gonna want it next time, next time
You can come here and kiss me or walk out the door
I can hold you for good girl, or not anymore
I'm tired of playing these games
Yeah you say that it's over
And then you tell me come over
It's like fire, and then it's like rain
Yeah we're hot and we're colder
You get me drunk and then sober
Tell me it's on if you want it to be
If you're moving on, then I think you should leave
I'm tired of playing these games, so I won't
Baby, love me or don't

You can love me if you want to
You can hate me if you don't
You can come here and kiss me or walk out the door
I can hold you for good girl, or not anymore

'Cause I'm tired of playing these games
Yeah you say that it's over
And then you tell me come over
It's like fire, and then it's like rain
Yeah we're hot and we're colder
You get me drunk and then sober
Tell me it's on if you want it to be
If you're moving on, then I think you should leave
I'm tired of playing these games, so I won't
Baby, love me or don't
Yeah baby, love me or don't
Baby, love me or don'tEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You're a crack of dawn, Monday morning, coffee strong
Poured everything you got into a paycheck Friday night
You're a Powerstroke diesel, backhoe riding king of beers, 18-wheeler driving, living life in between the lines
Of clocking in and quitting time

But then the six string circus comes to town
We hang them speakers over the crowd

When the lights come on, everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to the girl they're taking home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on

You're a little shy thing with a wild side
On a night like this, you just can't hide
'Cause it's time to live it up
So come on and raise your cup
If we're talking 'bout memories, yeah, we're gonna make 'em
Talking 'bout rules, you know we're gonna break 'em

When the lights come on, everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to the girl they're taking home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on

Yeah, we all the same 'cause we thinking the same thing
(Yeah, we all the same 'cause we thinking the same thing)
We on the same page 'cause we sipping the same drink
(We on the same page 'cause we sipping the same drink)
Here's a little something to thank y'all for showing up
Aldean and the boys about to blow it up, haha

When the lights come on, and everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to the girl they're taking home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on
Your boy's blowing it up
It's going all night long
When the lights come onEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's 3AM and I finally say
I'm sorry for actin' that way
I didn't really mean to make you cry
Oh, baby, sometimes I wonder why

Does it always have to come down to you leavin'
Before I'll say "I love you"?
Why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh, baby, why do I do that to you?

I know I'd never let you walk away
So why do I push you 'til you break?
And why are you always on the verge of goodbye
Before I'll show you how I really feel inside?

Why does it always have to come down to you leavin'
Before I'll say "I love you"?
And why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh, baby, why do I do that to you?
Why do I do that to you?

Why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh, baby, why do I do that to you?
Why do I do that to you?
Why do I do that to you?3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
