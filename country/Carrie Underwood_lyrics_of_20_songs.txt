Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot a whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, "I'm drunk"
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know
Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

Oh, maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats
Oh, before he cheats

I'm sorry, but I'm just a girl
Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keepin' it together
I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is

You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

Oh no, you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain, so let it flow like a river

You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

Oh no, you can't
Ooh, yeah

You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, you can't cry
No, you can't cry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

It was all roses, drippin' in diamonds
Sippin' on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Takin' his last name

She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And havin' dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always gettin' way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil livin' in his eyes
It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist

She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

Jenny slipped somethin' in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time

She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
Standin' there in a black dress singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She was drivin' last Friday on the way to Cincinnati
On a snow-white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way too fast
Before she knew it
She was spinnin' on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

"Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel"
It was still gettin' colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, "I'm sorry for the way
I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight"

"Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel"
"Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me"

Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed blow it down

There’s not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There’s not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there’s nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

She heard those sirens screamin' out
Her daddy laid there, passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge
Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there’s nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

There’s not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There’s not enough wind in Oklahoma

She's a small-town, hard-workin' woman
Just tryna make a livin'
Workin' three jobs, feeding four little mouths
In a run-down kitchen
When you're never takin' nothin' and doin' nothin' but givin'
It's hard to be a good wife and a good mom and a good Christian

She said, "I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sippin' from a highball glass
Let the world fade away"
She said, "I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a smoke break"

He's a big-city, hard-workin' man just tryna climb the ladder
First generation to go to college instead of drivin' a tractor
Never had nothin' handed to him on a silver platter
It's hard to be a good man, good son
Do somethin' good that matters

He said, "I don't drink
But sometimes I wanna pop that top
Take a swig and make the world stop
And watch it fade away"
He said, "I don't smoke
But sometimes I wanna light it up
Yeah, when things get tough
Sometimes I need a smoke break"
Yeah
So here's to you and here's to when the day gets long
Go ahead, I understand if you wanna take a load off

I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sipping from a highball glass
Let the world fade away
Yeah, and I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a, sometimes I need a

When the day gets long
When the work's all done
When the sun sets
When you need to forget
Grab that cup, mmm
Fill it up
Sip it slow
And let it all go

Two black Cadillacs driving in a slow parade
Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
One is for his wife
The other for the woman who loved him at night
Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time

And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn’t bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He’s not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

Two black Cadillacs
Two black Cadillacs

Two months ago, his wife called the number on his phone
Turns out he'd been lying to both of them for oh so long
They decided then, he’d never get away with doing this to them
Two black Cadillacs waiting for the right time, the right time
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn’t bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye
Yeah, they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He’s not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Yeah, yeah
(Two black Cadillacs)

It was the first and the last time they saw each other face to face
They shared a crimson smile and just walked away
And left the secret at the grave

And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils, they didn’t bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

That lipstick on your collar, well, it ain't my shade of pink
And I can tell by the smell of that perfume, it's like forty dollars too cheap
And there's a little wine stain on the pocket of your white cotton thread
Well, you drink beer and whiskey, boy, and you know I don't drink red

Found it over in the corner
Wadded up on the bedroom floor
You shoulda hid it in the closet
You shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it

If the neighbors get to asking, I won't cover nothin' up

Let me make one thing clear
You can buy me a beer, but you ain't taking me home
No pick up lines, I came here tonight to shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room
I couldn't help but notice you seem a little down on your love too
Yeah, my heart might be breaking
But, this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'

We should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We should be drinking alone, together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But, I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up
Tonight’s the night that never was
Baby, just forget my name
Won't be your one and only
But just 'cause we're lonely, don't mean that we should

We should be drinking alone

It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe
Something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hand

Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

The preacher man said, "Let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt"
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart
Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me

Oh, baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?

Then sings my soul, My Savior God, to Thee

When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration

Better listen to me, he’s low, low, low

You got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding and a hand you can hold
Just like you should, girl (Just like you should, girl)
Like every good girl does
Want a fairytale ending, somebody to love
But he’s really good at lying
Yeah, he’ll leave you in the dust
'Cause when he says forever
Well, it don’t mean much
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
So good for him
Better back away, honey, you don’t know where he’s been
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes
And go, go, go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he’s low
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, he’s no good, girl
Why can’t you see?
He’ll take your heart and break it
Listen to me, yeah

Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won’t you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He’s no good, he’s no good
Won’t you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find

He’s no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Don't wanna hear that stupid melody
The one we used to always keep playing on repeat
'Cause it just takes me to the place when you were mine
Where you laid my body down, and then got drunk on me like wine
Don't wanna feel that bass rattle in my bones
'Cause once I do, I know it won't leave me alone
It haunts me, baby, it does me wrong
But still, I just can't make myself delete it from my phone

That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me
I know, I shouldn't say it, but I just wanna play it
That song that we made love to
That we made love to, yeah

I know I'm contradicting everything I said
But I wanna turn it up when I'm lyin' in this bed
Pull the sheets over my head
Drift off dreamin', baby, go on, let it take my breath

That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me
I know I shouldn't say it, but I just wanna play it
That song (That song, that song)
That we made love to (That song, that song)
That we made love to, yeah
Me and you, you and me
On repeat, on repeat
Me and you, you and me
On repeat, on repeat

That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It breaks me, it makes me
Wanna hear it again and again and again
That song that we used to make love to
That song that we used to make love to
It kills me, heals me, gets me, thrills me
I know I shouldn't say it, but I just wanna play it
That song (That song, that song)
That we made love to (That song, that song)
That we made love to, yeah

That song, that song, that song
That song, that song, that song
That song, that song, that song
That song that we made love to, that we made love to, yeah4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She's waiting, praying that he don't drive tonight
She's pacing the floor, she's checking the time
Wondering how the glow with that porch light hasn't gone out
'Cause it's been on now for three days straight
He’s been nowhere to be found
Probably drowning in the neon, where the wagon broke down
She called up his mama and his friends in town
But they ain't seen him
Another night of no sleepin'

Round and around and around they go
Will it end? Nobody knows
She's all cried out on the kitchen floor
Spinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control
Spinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles

He's in a hotel room with the TV on
Gettin' lost in the static with the curtains drawn
Knowin' this could be the time that gets her gone for good
He'd quit if he could
But one down, two down, three down, four
Can't even recognize the man in the mirror anymore
Oh, 'round and around and around they go
Will it end? Nobody knows
He's passed out on the bathroom floor
Spinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control
Spinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles

This ain't a game
Nobody wins
Yeah, nobody gets lucky when that bottle spins
Again and again, again and again, again and again

So, 'round and around and around they go
Will this end? Nobody knows
Can't live like this anymore
Spinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control
Spinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles
Yeah, spinnin' bottles
Spinnin' bottles5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's two kids flying down the hall in the morning into our bedroom
It's a creaky board on the front porch
You swear you're gonna fix it soon
It's a kitchen table where we say our prayers
Give a little thanks to the man upstairs
It's the feeling I get, baby, when I look at you

It ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah
And it ain't a mansion on a hill
It's perfectly imperfect
It's worth more than it's worth
It's our life, it's our heart, it's our home
This is our kingdom

It's been late nights, a few good fights
Wouldn't sleep until we worked things out
It's been long days of leanin' on faith
Even when we had our doubts
Barely gettin' by, stretched to the limits
All the hard times, no, I wouldn't trade a minute
We've come so far, it made us who we are
Right here, right now
It ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah
And it ain't a mansion on a hill
It's perfectly imperfect
It's worth more than it's worth
It's our life, it's our heart, it's our home
And this is our kingdom
This is our, this is our, this is our kingdom
Oh, yeah, this is our kingdom

No, it ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah
And it ain't a mansion on a hill
It's perfectly imperfect
It's worth more than it's worth
It's our life, it's our heart, it's our home
This is our kingdom
Oh, yeah
This is our, this is our kingdom
This is our kingdom

It's our names carved out on that old oak tree
Pictures on the wall of you and me
It's our heart, it's our home, it's our babies faces
It's the light, it's the love living in this place
It's church on Sunday, tire swings
Good and the bad times
Praying on our knees
Thanking the lord for this beautiful life
The love we have built will stand the test of time, yeah
Oh, this is our kingdom
This is our kingdom, yeah
This is our kingdom
It's pictures on the wall of you and me
Thanking the lord, praying on our knees
In our kingdom8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
