Oh, I'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with the emerald dew
The pale amanita and eyes look like blue

I will dance, I will sing, and my loft shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming my idol was clay
All portion of love had all flown away

Oh, he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
He's left me no warning, no words of farewell

Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower
That's blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour
He's gone and neglected this pale wildwood flowerEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I was standing by the window
On one cold and cloudy day
And I saw the hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away
Can the circle be unbroken
By and by Lord, by and by
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Lord, I told the undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this body you are hauling
Lord, I hate to see her go
Can the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Oh, I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave
Can the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
I went back home, Lord, my home was lonesome
Since my mother, she was gone
All my brothers and sisters crying
What a home so sad and alone
Can the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
We sang songs of childhood
Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that mother Maybelle taught us
Hear the angels sing along
Will the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There's a dark and a troubled side of life
There's a bright and a sunny side, too
Though we meet with the darkness and strife
The sunny side we also may view

Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life

The storm and its fury broke today
Crushing hopes that we cherished so dear
Clouds and storm will in time pass away
The sun again will shine bright and clear

Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life

Let us greet with a song of hope each day
Though the moment be cloudy or fair
Let us trust in our Savior always
To keep us every one in his care
Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
If we'll keep on the sunny side of lifeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

This world is not my home, I'm just a-passing through
My treasures and my hopes are all beyond the blue;
Where many Christian children have gone on before
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
Over in glory land there is no dying there
The saints are shouting Victory and singing everywhere
I hear the voice of Nell that I have heard before
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

Oh Lord, You know I have no friend like you
If Heaven's not my home, Oh Lord what would I do?
Angels taken me to Heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

Heaven's expecting me that's one thing I know
I fixed it up with Jesus a long time ago
He will take me through though I am weak and poor
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
Oh I have a loving mother over in glory land
I don't expect to stop until I shake her hand
She's gone on before just waiting at heaven's door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

For my lord for my lord
It's a holy ghost building
For my lord for my lord

If I was a liar I tell you what I would do
I would quit my lying and work on a building too

I have heard of a land, on the faraway strand
This is a beautiful home of the soul
Built for Jesus on high, there we never shall die
This is a land where we'll never grow old

Never grow old, (where we'll) never grow old
In the land where we'll never grow old
Never grow old, (where we'll) never grow old
In the land where we'll never grow old

In that beautiful home, where we'll nevermore roam
We shall be in the sweet by and by
Happy praise to the king, through eternity sing
Is a land where we never shall die


When our work here is done, and the life's crown is won
And our troubles and trials are o'er
All our sorrow will end, and our voices will blend
With the loved ones who've gone on before

My heart is sad, and I'm in sorrow
For the only one I love
When shall I see him, oh, no, never
Till I meet him in heaven above

Oh, bury me under the weeping willow
Yes, under the weeping willow tree
So he may know where I am sleeping
And perhaps he will weep for me

They told me that he did not love me
I could not believe it was true
Until an angel softly whispered
"He has proven untrue to you"


Tomorrow was our wedding day
But, Oh Lord, where is he?
He's gone to seek him another bride
And he cares no more for me

Oh, bury me under the violets blue
To prove my love to him
Tell him that I would die to save him
For his love I never could win

The judgement day is drawing nigh
Where shall I be
When God the work of men shall try
Where shall I be
When east and west the fire will roll
Where shall I be
How will it be with my poor soul
Where shall I be

Oh, where shall I be
When the first trumpet sounds
Oh, where shall I be
When it sounds so loud
When it sounds so loud as to wake up the dead
Oh, where shall I be when it sounds

When wicked men his wrath shall see
Where shall I be
And to the rocks and mountains flee
Where shall I be
When hills and mountains flee away
Where shall I be
And all the work of men decay
Where shall I be

When the savior reigns from shore to shore
Where shall I be
From God's angry presence thrown
Where shall I be

Well, I'll be sleeping in my grave
When the first trumpet sounds
I'll be sleeping in my grave
When it sounds so loud
When it sounds so loud as to wake up the dead

Wonderful things of folks are said
When they have passed away
Roses adorn their narrow bed
Over the sleeping clay

Give me the roses while I live
Trying to cheer me on
Useless are flowers that you give
After the soul has gone

Let us not wait to do good deeds
Till they have passed away
Now is the time to sow good seeds
While here on earth we stay


Kind words are useless when folks lie
Cold in a narrow bed
Don't wait till death to speak kind words
Now should the words be said

One morning as I rambled all down the seashore
The wind it did whistle and the waters did roar
I heard a fair damsel make a pitiful sound
It sounded so lonesome in the waters around

I never will marry or be no man's wife
I expect to live single all the days of my life
The shells in the ocean shall be my deathbed
The fish in deep water swim over my head

She plunged her fair body in the ocean so deep
She closed her blue eyes in the waters to sleep
My love's gone and left me, the one I adore
She's gone where I never will see her anymore

I never will marry or be no man's wife
I expect to live single all the days of my life
The shells in the ocean shall be my deathbed
The fish in deep water swim over my headEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There's a church in the valley by the wildwood,
No lovelier place in the dale
No spot is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the dale
CHORUS
Oh come, come, come, come
Come to the church in the wildwood
Oh come to the church in the dale
No spot is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the dale
How sweet on a clear Sabbath morning
To listen to the clear ringing bell
Its tones so sweetly are calling
Oh come to the church in the dale

There close by the side of a loved one
’neath the trees where the wild flowers bloom
She sleeps, sweetly sleeps ‘neath a willow
Disturb not her rest in the tomb

CHORUS
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now
But I won't be worried long
I went across the river, I lay down to sleep
I went across the river, I lay down to sleep
When I woke up
Had shackles on my feet
Twenty-nine links of chain around my leg
Twenty-nine links of chain around my leg
And on each leg
The initials of my name
CHORUS
I asked the judge, what might be my fine?
I asked the judge, what might be my fine?
Twenty-one years
On the Rocky Mountain Line
The train I ride, sixteen coaches long
The train I ride, sixteen coaches long
The girl I love
Is on that train and gone

If anyone asks you who composed this song
If anyone asks you who composed this song
Tell 'em was I
And I sing it all day long

For fear the hearts of men are failing
For these are latter days we know
The Great Depression now is spreading
God's word declared it would be so
I'm going where there's no depression
To the lovely land that's free from care
I'll leave this world of toil and trouble
My home's in Heaven, I'm going there
In that bright land, there'll be no hunger
No orphan children crying for bread
No weeping widows, toil or struggle
No shrouds, no coffins and no death
I'm going where there's no depression
To the lovely land that's free from care
I'll leave this world of toil and trouble
My home's in Heaven, I'm going there
This dark hour of midnight nearing
Tribulation time will come
This storm will hurl in midnight fear
And sweep lost millions to their doom
I'm going where there's no depression
To the lovely land that's free from care
I'll leave this world of toil and trouble

Would have been better for us both had we never
In this wide and wicked world had never met
For the pleasure we've both seen together
I am sure, love, I'll never forget

Oh, I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes
Who is sailing far over the sea
Oh, I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes
And I wonder if he ever thinks of me

Oh, you told me once, dear, that you loved me
You said that we never would part
But a link in the chain has been broken
Leaves me with a sad and aching heart


When the cold, cold grave shall enclose me
Will you come, dear, and shed just one tear
And say to the strangers around you
A poor heart you have broken lies here

While walking out one evening
Not knowing where to go
Just to pass the time away
Before we held our show
I heard the Bethel Nation stand
Singing with all their might
I give my heart to Jesus
And left the show that night

The day will soon be over and digging will be done
And no more gems be gathered, so let us all press on
When Jesus comes to claim us and says it is enough
The diamonds will be shining, no longer in the rough

One day, my precious comrade
You, too, were lost in sin
And others sought your rescue
And Jesus took you in
And when you're tired and tempted
And scoffers can rebuff
Don't turn away in anger
This diamond in the rough

While reading through the Bible
Some wondrous sights I see
I read of Peter, James, and John
On the Sea of Galilee
And Jesus when he found them
He bound them very tough
And they were precious diamonds
He gathered in the rough

When death shall close these eye lids
And this heart shall cease to beat
And they lay me down to rest
In some flowery bound retreat

Will you miss me?
(Miss me when I'm gone)
Will you miss me?
(Miss me when I'm gone)
Will you miss me?
(Miss me when I'm gone)
Will you miss me when I'm gone?

Perhaps you'll plant a flower
On my poor unworthy grave
Come and sit along beside me
When the roses nod and wave


One sweet thought my soul shall cherish
When this fleeting life has flown
This sweet thought will cheer when dying
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
When these lips shall never more
Press a kiss upon thy brow
But lie cold and still in death
Will you love me then as now?

I found a sweet haven of sunshine at last
In Jesus abiding above
His dear arms around me are lovingly cast
And sweetly he tells his love

The tempest is o'er
(The dangerous tempest forever is o'er)
I'm safe evermore
(My anchor is holding, I'm safe evermore)
What gladness, what rapture is mine
(What gladness, what rapture is mine)
The danger is past
(The waters are peaceful, the danger is past)
I'm anchored at last
(My spirit is happy, I'm anchored at last)
I'm anchored in love divine
(I'm anchored in love divine)

He saw me endangered and lovingly came
To pilot my stormy doomed soul
Sweet peace he has spoken and bless his sweet name
The billows no longer roll

His love shall enfold me through life and in death
Completely I'll trust to the end
I'll praise him each hour and my last fleeting breath
Shall sing of my soul's best friend
