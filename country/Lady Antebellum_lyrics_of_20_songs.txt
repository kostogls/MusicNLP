"Hey, sorry I missed your call, just leave a message after the beep"
"Hey, yeah, it's me, just been thinking about everything tonight and I don't know. I just miss you so much
Give me a call back if you can?"

Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
Whoa, oh

I guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

I just need you now
Oh baby, I need you now38EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

How can someone stand so damn close
And feel like they're worlds away?
I can see your sad story eyes
So how do you have no words to say?
All I want is to fall in deeper
Than I've ever been
Why won't you let me?
I can handle your heart, so help me

Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim
But the waves keep crashin' in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you

Like a lighthouse I've been shinin' bright
Through the dark for the both of us
And "I've done it outta love" is not enough
But God, how I wish it was
And I don't wanna find out
How much lonely I can take before you lose me
Baby, look at me and swear you won't lose me
Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim
But the waves keep crashin' in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you

I can't let it go
From moments in your arms
But they come back again
The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves
The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves

Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim
But the waves keep crashin' in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's supposed to hurt, it's a broken heart
But to movin' on is the hardest part
It comes in waves, the letting go
But the memory fades, everybody knows
Everybody knows

What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye?
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?

Maybe months go by, maybe years from now
And I meet someone and it's workin' out
Every now and then, he can see right through
'Cause when I look at him
Yeah, all I  see is you

What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye?
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?
Ooh yeah
What if I never get over?
What if I never get closure?
What if I never get back all the wasted words I told ya?
What if It never gets better?
What if this lasts forever and ever and ever?

I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?
What if I gave you (What if I gave you) everything I got?
What if your love was my one and only shot?
What if I end up with nothing to compare it to
What if I never get over? Oh, if I never get over
What if I never get over you?

What if I never get over you?
Oh, what if I never get over?

I paint my lips red, I turn my own head
Don't need nobody's help, zipping up my own dress
Pay my own tab, with my own cash, unattached
Sometimes the word alone, sounds like a sad song
But why's it gotta be, 'cause what I really need is a reset
And a deep breath, yeah

I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a Saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a California king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break

It's just a little phase, give me a little space
You might see through it, but I'm putting on a poker face
Givin' love a rest, between my ex, and my next

I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a Saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a California king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break
Love, I'm over you (Love, I'm over you)
It's long overdue
I think it's time to take a heart break (I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound)
I think it's time to take a heart break

Oh, I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a Saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines

Lyin' here with you so close to me
It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe
I'm caught up in this moment
I'm caught up in your smile

I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
But we don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
No, I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight

I know that if we give this a little time
It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find
It's never felt so real
No, it's never felt so right
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight

No, I don't wanna say goodnight
I know it's time to leave
But you'll be in my dreams
Tonight
Tonight

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
I don't wanna push too far

8 o’clock on Friday night I’m still at home
All my girls just keep on blowin' up my phone
Sayin', "Come on, he ain’t worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name"
Now there’s only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye

What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

Tonight I’ll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I’ll let him down easy
'Cause tonight it’s all about dancin' with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

I’m feelin' that buzz
I’m ready to rock
Ain’t no way I’m gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I’m comin' in hot
Hey bartender
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh

Hey Bartender
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around

If my memory gets the best of me
Then I'll always find an excuse
Yeah, I'll make believe, re-write history
Ignite a spark I can't undo
It always starts out simple like a conversation
Before I know it, I'm lost in your illumination

If you catch my eye across a crowded room
I'll fall into the atmosphere surrounding you
If you pull me close just to disappear
The chances are, I'd wait for you a thousand years
If you light the fuse, you know that I'll react
If you're reckless with your love just to take it back
You could hurt somebody like that

You're a carnival on a summer night
Gone too soon every time
Yeah, it's beautiful how you burn so bright
In the waste land you leave behind

If you catch my eye across a crowded room
I'll fall into the atmosphere surrounding you
If you pull me close just to disappear
The chances are, I'd wait for you a thousand years
If you light the fuse, you know that I'll react
If you're reckless with your love just to take it back
You could hurt somebody like that
If you call me up at 3AM
I'll run to the rescue time and time and time again

If you pull me close just to disappear
The chances are, I'd wait for you a thousand years
If you light the fuse, you know that I'll react
If you're reckless with your love just to take it back

Keep those lights on
Toys on the front lawn
Disney World trip next summer
Used kit for our little air-drummer
Food on the table
Brand new cradle
For the angel that's coming in a minute
This house and everybody in it

Got my bags packed, got my ticket
Got a heartache to go with it
Baby, kiss me, say you'll miss me
Oh, while we still got time

Take a look at our little paradise
It ain't much but baby, you and I
Picked the right stars, made the right wish
Ain't nothing out there like this
And it kills me that I gotta go
Couldn't do it if I didn't know
That every time I'm walking out that door
You know what I'm leaving for
When I'm out there
I know I'm where
I'm meant to be picking them strings
And getting that small town to sing
On that last turn home
I can hardly wait
To drop my bags, kiss your face
'Cause all I can do is stop and

Take a look at our little paradise

Well, all the parties on the streets are talkin'
Store front mannequins sleeping in the lights
We used to smoke while we were jay-walking
Like it was your birthday every other Saturday night
Knew the bands so we never payed our cover
Wrote our names on the bathroom tiles
We never dressed to impress all the others
They would let us in on our laid back kinda style
But boy, you know it's been a while

And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
You talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh, anymore

I got some platforms sitting in the corner
They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk
I got a dress that'll show a little uh-uh
But you ain't getting uh-uh
If you don't come pick me up (Damn)
Show me off (Wow)
You might be tired, but I'm not
And I don't know why you don't take me downtown

On a boat, on a beach
In the water, in the sand, in the back of a bar
Cold beer in your hand
Breaking hearts, breaking necks
When we rolling down the street, heads turning all day when they see you with me
I'm thinking everybody better stand in line
'Cause they need to know that your body's coming with me tonight

They're like, "Hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin' from the second that you walk in
And baby, you look good all day, all night
You look good, so fresh, so fine
You look good, got everybody watching you like cameras in Hollywood
Baby, you look good
Aw, baby, you look good

Black dress to the nines, New Year's in a pent
From the floor, to the roof, make the skyline spin
Yeah, you're killing me boy in your black-faded jeans
Ain't gotta work hard when you're smilin' at me
Like, "Hey, who that there with the shades?"

Every day I drive by
A little white church
It's got these little white crosses
Like angels in the yard
Maybe I should stop on in
Say a prayer
Maybe talk to God
Like he is there

Well, hello world, how ya been?

You're a passing car on a one way street
Heading straight through the red lights where the midnight and heartbreak meet
You're a bird in flight to a house in flames
Yeah, you've played every card, but you know it's a losing game

Let it pull you like a song you know
It might look like a dream come true
But it only leads you straight into
The thing that wrecks you

If I could change, I'd be good for you
Oh, I hate all the madness and pain that I've put you through
It's not your fault (It's not your fault), it's just how I am (It's just how I am)
You're a deer in the headlights and I'm driving as fast as I can (As fast as I can)

Oh, you're running down a darkened road
Where even angels might not go
And your star's got a lonely glow
And I pull you like a song you know
We might look like a dream come true
But it only leads you straight into
The thing that wrecks you (Wrecks you)
The thing that wrecks you (Wrecks you)
The thing that wrecks you
The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you (Ooh)
The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you (Wrecks you)
The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you
You're a passing car on a one way street
(The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you)
(The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you)
(The thing that wrecks you, that wrecks you)
(The thing that wrecks you, that wrecks you)

The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you (Oh, the thing that wrecks you)
The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you
The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you
The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you (Wrecks you)
The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you (Wrecks you)
The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you (The thing that wrecks you)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There's a four-by-six of a sunset kiss
And one of you laughin' at me catching my first fish
One on Valentine's Day
With the mariachi band at our favorite place

Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures
The camera doesn't show the way it hurt
No, that ain't the way I remember it happenin'
In between the flashes it was sad, it was tragic
Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures

There's one on my phone that I can't erase (One on my phone)
But you'd never know by the smile on my face
That inside I was dying, later that night I'd be crying
The last one before "Goodbye"

Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures
The camera doesn't show the way it hurt
No, that ain't the way I remember it happening
In between the flashes it was sad, it was tragic
Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures
No photo evidence, not a single proof
Of all the hell that we went through

But damn, we sure looked happy in pictures
The camera doesn't show the way it hurt
No, that ain't the way I remember it happening
In between the flashes it was sad, it was tragic
Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures

(So happy)
(So happy in pictures), oh, yes we did
Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures (So happy)
(So happy in pictures)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The sunset falls in Wichita, yellow dances through the blue
Wheat fields catch a glimpse of heaven, makes me think of you
And even when you're miles away
You're always on my mind
Lord knows you're in my heart
Even when I close my eyes

You are golden
Precious as a prayer flying up through the air
While the rain is falling
Golden; timeless as a kiss
Baby, I don't wanna miss another perfect moment
To tell you, how you make me feel
The day you strolled in, my heart was stolen
'Cause you are golden

Smallest parts of who you are
Are everything to me
From the way you laugh to the way you cry
To the way you love on me
Shadows run and darkness fades
When you come around
My single star amongst the gray
Always shining down
You are golden
Precious as a prayer flying up through the air
While the rain is falling
Golden; timeless as a kiss
Baby, I don't wanna miss another perfect moment
To tell you, how you make me feel
The day you strolled in, my heart was stolen (Heart was stolen)
'Cause you are golden

Lovely
Oh so hard to find
Yeah, you are goodness, forgiveness
Of the purest kind
Oh yeah

From the day you strolled in, my heart was stolen
You'll be the hand I'm holding
When the heavens open
'Cause you are golden, yeah1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
