No man ever seen the face of his foe, no
He ain't made of flesh and bone
He's the one who sits up close beside you
And when he's there you are alone
Every man is evil, yes
And every man's a liar
Unashamed with the wicked tongue
Sing in the black soul choir
Every man is evil, yes
And every man's a liar
Unashamed with the wicked tongue
The black soul choir
Oh, he rises in my way
Oh, he rises in my way
No man ever seen the face of my Lord, no
Not since he left his skin
He's the one you keep cold on the outside girlie
He's at your door, let him in
Every man is evil, yes
And every man's a liar
Unashamed with the wicked tongue
Sing in the black soul choir
Every man is evil, yes
And every man's a liar
Unashamed with the wicked tongue
The black soul choir
Oh, he rises in my way
Oh, he rises in my way
I will forgive your wrongs, I am able
For my own I feel great shame
I will offer up a brick to the back of your head, boy
If I was Cain
Every man is evil, yes
And every man's a liar
Unashamed with the wicked tongue
Sing in the black soul choir
Every man is evil, yes
And every man's a liar
Unashamed with the wicked tongue
The black soul choir
Oh, he rises in my way
Oh, he rises in my way1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hangin' lifeless on his every word -- o man

I seen ya in your red room laughin'
With your shinin' coffee can
So many wrongs all kinds a goins on
Held my head an ran
But I hid and did a bit more lookin'
Saw ya dancin' on the pine porch creakin'
Mouth open an doors down wide
Here's what was inside
I seen what I saw
An these things I do are wrong, that's all
An these tales I tales I tell are tall
Then I climbed up on the big horse strappin'
Put the spur down to blood
He took off 16 horses strong
Left me lyin' in mud
An there I sit until the sun's up shinin'
Yes an black stands my ride
Twenty hands high
An watchin' spookeyed
My hands on his side1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

On from here walkin dreams awake
I think not, I think not
The sky comes king blown in every direction
And of no country
I am straw
It is no mystery
I know my way from here
Iron sharpens iron
Crooked wooden and peacock black
I have your feathers
Slung across my back
I'm not the only one
To help you down the hill
My blue knuckles do as they will
It is no mystery
I know my way from here
It is no mystery
I know my way from here
One as precious as the other
They go with me
Today I am not a false conscience
A tyrant
Angels line my pockets dear
I walk a hutterite mile
Look at me this once
Put an eye to my step
Look and furrow
It's only misery it's only ankle deep
It is no mystery
I know my way from here
It is no mystery
I know my way from hereEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Don't let your mind do all your walking
Boy you'll stumble every time
That road I seen the devil stalking
Dealin' only with the dyin'
G'on let the door hitem
Where my hound dog shoulda bittem
Leave him open, leave em there
I don't care
But baby don't look down
Keep your, keep your arms around me
Then he showed me how he caught ya
Like a fish upon the line
Slow reelin' in he brings you closer
Like a poison that takes it's time
Roll over little lady
Back and forth and twice around
You're gonna bleed to get away
There ain't no other way round
But baby don't look down
Keep your, keep your arms around me
Hey, hey little baby
There, there little boy
Where, where little angel
Over here my joy
Hey, hey little baby
There, there little girl
Where, where little angel
Over here my pearl
But baby don't look down
Keep your, keep your arms around meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

O the sky grey orange
An the walls stained blue
An i laid right down on the golden satin with you
Into sween dark circles of beautiful eyes
I go round
O lord
I go round
Will you tell me once again
Cream white skin
You are my friend
I seen you walkin' and your white hips sway
O girl i will have you no more
To the moan in your voice
Not a charm do you lack
Your skin to touch as a black ravens back
But i cannot go far with these words as they rhyme
As to tell, of the pleasure, your hand in mine
An i pray as i say this song in this way
That your eyes they would close an your head begin to sway
An you'll feel how he heals with his blood on our skin
I am yours lady scrawled an thin
Will you tell me once again
Cream white skin
You are my friend
I seen you walkin' in your husband's way
Girl i will have you moreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Listen closely to me now, my darlin' girl
There's one who's out to have you and just his breath will burn your curls
Don't you fret, you needn't bother
Don't you fret, here comes the Father, yeah

Whatcha doing up atop my roof
Creeping across them shingles
You about scared me half to death, girl
What's your name, Ruthie Lingle?

Oh yeah, I heard your talking
That little Jesus geek need a good ass, good ass clocking
Oh yeah, I seen your mocking
Don't you dare boy, think my Lord hath done forgotten? No

I beseech thee, Lord, clear my head
Before once again I scar the soul of that girl in my bed
O Lord, clear my bed before once again
I scar the soul of that girl in my head

Revenge is mine saith the LordEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
Travelin' through a world of woe
Ain't no sickness, toil, nor danger
In that bright land to which I go
I'm goin' there to see my Father
Said He'd meet me when I come
I'm only goin' over Jordan
I'm only goin' over home
I know dark clouds gonna gather 'round me
I know my way it'll be rough and steep
Yet beautiful fields lie just before me
Where God's redeemed did vigils keep
I'm goin' there to see my loved ones
Gone before me one by one
I'm only goin' over Jordan
I'm only goin' over home
I'll soon be free from earthly trials
This body rests in the orchard's yard
I'll drop this cross of self-denial
And go singing home to God
I'm goin' there to see my Savior
To dwell with Him no more to roam
I'm only goin' over Jordan
I'm only goin' over home
I'm only goin' over homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Early one days morning
I came upon a fine young horse
I mounted up and led him onward
He was gray as the sky above
As the sky above
I slept down by the river
And what a sad dream I had
I'm afraid my love
It must be true
Today I will go and leave you
Today I will be gone
I awoke and was surrounded
Nine of the law stood before me
Askin me my name and business
Demanding proof of me
Demanding proof of me
Proof of me
What do you want from me
Would you have me your prisoner
No but you must give us that horse
You must give us that roan gray horse
Listen he ain't for sale
Never for the law to ride
If that should happen none would be safe
Even the birds
Even the birds
Would be afraid to fly
So they ask again what was my name they ask again what was my name
Two were dead before they could move
Two were dead before they could move
That's my name
That's my name
If you please
That's my name
That's my name
If you pleaseEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

To hell with boys creepin' up slowly
Swingin' them shovels 'round
Diggin' up words of pleasure
From evil hollow ground
O - an' here's one now girl
The devil is in his eye
You'd better start stirring up soil boy
Or hear e'are you'll lye
Whispered to you in the dark
And I think you heard me say
Let's say goodbye like we said hello
In a friendly kind of way
Ye charlie's neat an' charlie's keen but
David he's a dandy
David he's a nice young man
He feeds the girls on candy
Whispered to you in the dark
And all that sordid gain
Let's say goodbye like we said hello
In a friendly kinda way

Come to my house an we'll pick bones
There hands outside ready with stones
Come to my yard

We'll sit on the porch
As the good men stare

You are not needed here
To help me feel low down
I'm doin' it fine all on my own

An for you there'll be no stoppin'
I see you lyin' in a pine box with bitter words

Is anything as lovely to me
As the truth in love
I'll take it over freedom any day
It brings me ever an' this time to my knees
An' on my knees I run away
Yes I know your sticks and stones they
They will easily break these bones an'
An' all my words come back to haunt me
I will put my strength into
The things left standing
I am hoarse with wild eyes
No debts outstanding
My hands are yours my brother
You can take my coat as well
My eyes are yours sister
And my heart, and my heart
In which he dwells
Heard the voice of my master callin' me
From deep in the hollow
Said that I must follow him there yeah
Is any place darker for me
With all them wolves about
Well it's a poor mouth that I wear
My hands are yours my brother
You can take my coat as well
My eyes are yours sister
And my heart, and my heart
In which he dwells
Livin' from hand to poor mouth
You an' me an' my secret southEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When they poured across the border
I was cautioned to surrender
This I could not do;
I took my gun and vanished
I have changed my name so often
I've lost my wife and children
But I have many friends
And some of them are with me
An old woman gave us shelter
Kept us hidden in the garret
Then the soldiers came;
She died without a whisper
There were three of us this morning
I'm the only one this evening
But I must go on;
The frontiers are my prison
Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
Through the graves the wind is blowing
Freedom soon will come;
Then we'll come from the shadows
Les Allemands étaient chez moi
Ils me dirent, "Résigne toi,"
Mais je n'ai pas peur;
J'ai repris mon âme
[The Germans were at my home
They said, "Sign yourself,"
But I am not afraid
I have retaken my soul.]
J'ai changé cent fois de nom
J'ai perdu femme et enfants
Mais j'ai tant d'amis;
J'ai la France entière
[I've changed names a hundred times
I have lost wife and children
But I have so many friends
I have all of France]
Un vieil homme dans un grenier
Pour la nuit nous a caché
Les Allemands l'ont pris;
Il est mort sans surprise
[An old man, in an attic
Hid us for the night
The Germans captured him
He died without surprise.]
Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
Through the graves the wind is blowing
Freedom soon will come;
Then we'll come from the shadowsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

All I need a floorboard
An' a wooden shoe
Step aside an' let my lady through
Hey foot, straw foot
Low we lay 'em down
Hey foot, straw foot

See the high priest
He took my place
When the judge looks to me
He saw his son's face
Not gonna join you in
Your tower of babble, boy
Tired o' that talkin'
I'm sick o' that noise
Hey foot, straw foot
Low we lay 'em down
Hey foot, straw foot
Coverin' ground

An' looks can be deceivin'
When we get down to it
You're talkin' when you
Should be leavin'
I've been to nebraska
It reminded me of spain
All the questions loaded
All my answers same
Hey foot, straw foot
Low we lay 'em down
Hay foot, straw foot
Coverin' ground

Let's say it true this time
I need your forgiveness
Just like you need mine

Lovely lovely carol sue
I see the heel of the father
Crush the head of the serpent for you
An' that beast who found
His way up to your room
You know the one the one
Who's colors are never true
Yeah you do
Yet all the while 'neath
His banner you did stand
'neath the shadow of his wing
Do you remember
Sorrow stands near an' close at hand
Sorrow stands an' in sorrow's hand
The burning ember
He'll come a cinder
Fire call the kettle black
The dark can only hinder it
It will not hold you back
Nor tear you asunder
And the good shepherd
Lo he left all the others
An' went to look for you
Yes an' he did find thee
An' with bruised hands
He did unbind thee
Brought you out
Into the light of day
He'll come a cinder
Fire call the kettle black
The dark can only hinder it
It will not hold you back
Nor tear you asunder
O come and stand with me mother
As we wait for the master's voice
An' head that way together
He'll come a cinder
Fire call the kettle black
The dark can only hinder it
It will not hold you back

I left there stiff - stiff as a board
Where could i go but to the lord
When will i hurt for heaven's sake
When will i suffer for the sake of heaven
All my love well it is madness
Freely given to you folks with gladness
I will not live and die - no not by the sword

Let's bend our knees like we know we should
We can't see clear - our eyes are made of wood
Taste and see boy that the lord is goodEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
