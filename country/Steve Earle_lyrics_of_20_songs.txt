Well my name's John Lee Pettimore
Same as my daddy and his daddy before
You hardly ever saw Grandaddy down here
He only come to town about twice a year
He'd buy a hundred pounds of yeast and some copper line
Everybody knew that he made moonshine
Now the revenue man wanted Grandaddy bad
He headed up the holler with everything he had
It's before my time, but I've been told
He never came back from Copperhead Road

Now Daddy ran the whiskey in a big block Dodge
Bought it at an auction at the Mason's Lodge
'Johnson County Sheriff' painted on the side
Just shot a coat of primer then he looked inside
Well him and my uncle tore that engine down
I still remember that rumblin' sound
Then the sheriff came around in the middle of the night
Heard Mama cryin', knew something wasn't right
He was headed down to Knoxville with the weekly load
You could smell the whiskey burnin' down Copperhead Road
I volunteered for the Army on my birthday
They draft the white trash first round here anyway
I done two tours of duty in Vietnam
I came home with a brand new plan
I take the seed from Colombia and Mexico
I just plant it up the holler down Copperhead Road
And now the D.E.A.'s got a chopper in the air
I wake up screaming like I'm back over there
I learned a thing or two from Charlie, don't you know?
You better stay away from Copperhead Road

Hey pretty baby, are you ready for me?
Yeah it's your good rocking daddy down from Tennessee
I'm just out of Austin, bound for San Antone
With the radio blasting and the bird dog on
There's a speed trap up ahead in Selma Town
But no local yokel gonna shut me down
Because me and my boys got this rig unwound
And we've come a thousand miles from a Guitar Town
Nothing ever happened around my hometown
And I ain't the kind to just hang around
But I heard someone calling my name one day
And I followed that voice down the lost highway
Everybody told me you can't get far
On thirty-seven dollars and a Jap guitar
Now I'm smokin' into Texas with the hammer down
And a rocking little combo from the Guitar Town
Hey pretty baby, don't you know it ain't my fault?
I love to hear the steel belts humming on the asphalt
Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop
Stumble in the restaurant wondering why I don't stop
Well I got to keep rocking while I still can
I got a two pack habit and a motel tan
When my boots hit the boards, I'm a brand new man
With my back to the riser, I make my stand
Hey pretty baby, won't you hold me tight?
I'm loading up and rolling out of here tonight
One of these days I'm gonna settle down
And take you back with me to the Guitar TownEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk
Of a day-i-ay-i-ay
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk
Of a fine soft day-i-ay
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do?
Because her hair was black and her eyes were blue
And I knew right then, I'd be taking a whirl
Around the Salthill prom with a Galway girl
We were halfway there when the rain came down
Of a day-i-ay-i-ay
She asked me up to her flat downtown
Of a fine soft day-i-ay
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do?
Because her hair was black and her eyes were blue
I took her hand and I give her a twirl
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl
When I woke up, I was all alone
With a broken heart and a ticket home
And I ask you now, tell me what would you do?
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue
'Cause I've traveled around, I've been all over this world
Boys, I ain't never seen nothing like a Galway girl1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I was born on this mountain a long time ago
Before they knocked down the timber and strip-mined the coal
When you rose in the mornin' before it was light
To go down in that dark hole and come back up at night
I was born on this mountain, this mountain's my home
She holds me and keeps me from worry and woe
Well, they took everything that she gave, now they're gone
But I'll die on this mountain, this mountain's my home
I was young on this mountain but now I am old
And I knew every holler, every cool swimmin' hole
â€˜Til one night I lay down and woke up to find
That my childhood was over and I went down in the mine
There's a hole in this mountain and it's dark and it's deep
And God only knows all the secrets it keeps
There's a chill in the air only miners can feel
There're ghosts in the tunnels that the company sealedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I was born my papa's son
A wandering eye and a smoking gun
Now some of you would live through me
Then lock me up and throw away the key
Or just find a place to hide away
And hope that I just go away

That I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
I feel alright, I feel alright tonight

I'll bring you precious contraband
And ancient tales from distant lands
Of conquerors and concubines
And conjurers from darker times
Betrayal and conspiracy
Sacrilege and heresy

That I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
I feel alright, I feel alright tonight

I got everything you won't need
Your darkest fear, your fondest dream
I ask you questions, tell you lies
Criticize and sympathize
Yeah but be careful what you wish for, friend
Because I've been to hell and now I'm back again
I feel alright, yeah I feel alright tonight
Yeah I feel alright, and I feel alright tonight
I feel alright, I feel alrightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Another year has come and gone
Another circle around the sun
Another thousand tears have fallen
I don't ever count 'em 'cause
I'm surrounded by your love
And days are never long enough

Four more seasons on parade
Show their colors then they fade
But that won't happen to us, darling
We'll remember how it was
Then begin again because
Days are never long enough

Time's never late, isn't bound by our fate
Try as we may, love might never be found, if we wait
Until the sun comes up on another day, my love
Days are never long enough

Time's never late, isn't bound by our fate

I'm an American, boys
I've come a long way
I was born and bred in the USA
So listen up close
I've got somethin' to say
Boys, I'm buying this round

Well it took a little while, but we're in this fight
And we ain't going home until we've done what's right
We're going to drink Camden Town dry tonight
If I have to spend my last pound

When I first got to London it was pouring down rain
Met a little girl in the field canteen
Painted her name on the nose of my plane
Six more missions, I'm gone

Well I asked if I could stay and she said that I might
Then the warden came around yelling "shut out the lights"
Death raining out of the London night
We made love 'til dawn
But when Johnny Come Lately comes marching home
With a chest full of medals and a G.I. loan
They'll be waiting at the station down in San Antone
When Johnny comes marching home

My P-47 is a pretty good ship
And she took a round coming cross the Channel last trip
I was thinking about my baby and letting her rip
Always got me through so far

Well they can ship me all over this great big world
Never find nothing like my North End girl
I'm taking her home with me one day, sir
Soon as we win this war

But when Johnny Come Lately comes marching home
With a chest full of medals and a G.I. loan
They'll be waiting at the station down in San Antone
When Johnny comes marching home
Johnny!
1:47 - 2:09

Now my granddaddy sang me this song
Told me about London when the Blitz was on
How he married Grandma and brought her back home
A hero throughout this land

Now I'm standing on a runway in San Diego
A couple purple hearts, so I move a little slow
There's nobody here, maybe nobody knows
About a place called Vietnam

But when Johnny Come Lately comes marching home
With a chest full of medals and a G.I. loan
They'll be waiting at the station down in San Antone
When Johnny comes marching home

There ain't a lot that you can do in this town
You drive down to the lake and then you turn back around
You go to school and you learn to read and write
So you can walk into the county bank and sign away your life

Now I work at the filling station on the interstate
I'm pumping gasoline and counting out-of-state plates
They ask me, "How far into Memphis, son, and where's the nearest beer?"
And they don't even know that there's a town around here

Someday I'm finally going to let go
Because I know there's a better way
And I want to know what's over that rainbow
I'm going to get out of here someday, someday

Now my brother went to college because he played football
But I'm still hanging round 'cause I'm a little bit small
But I got me a '67 Chevy, she's low and sleek and black
Someday I'll put her on that interstate and never look back

Someday I'm finally going to let go
Because I know there's a better way
And I want to know what's over that rainbow
I'm going to get out of here someday, someday
I'm going to get out of here

About the time that Daddy left to fight the big war
I saw my first pistol in the general store
In the general store when I was thirteen
Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen

I asked if I could have one someday when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up
She really blew up, I didn't understand
Mama said, "The pistol is the devil's right hand"

The devil's right hand
The devil's right hand
Mama said, "The pistol is the devil's right hand"

My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt
Shoot as fast as lightning but she loads a mite slow
Loads a mite slow and soon I found out
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out

So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45
Called a Peacemaker, but I never knew why
Never knew why, I didn't understand
Mama said, "The pistol is the devil's right hand"
The devil's right hand
The devil's right hand
Mama said, "The pistol is the devil's right hand"

The devil's right hand
The devil's right hand
Mama said, "The pistol is the devil's right hand"

1:38 - 1:53

Well I got into a card game in a company town
Caught a miner cheatin'
I shot the dog down
Shot the dog down
I watched the man fall
Never touched his holster
Never had a chance to draw

My trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, "Not guilty," I said
"Not guilty", I said, "you've got the wrong man"
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand
The devil's right hand
Mama said, "The pistol is the devil's right hand"

The devil's right hand
The devil's right hand
Nothin' touched the trigger
But the devil's right hand
My Mama said, "The pistol is the devil's right hand"EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

So you wanna be an outlaw? Better take it from me
Living on the highway ain't everything it's supposed to be
Everybody reckons that they wanna be free
Ain't nobody wants to be alone
Stumblin' in the alley at a quarter to three
Hollering after Sally, "Honey, what you trying to do to me?"
Told me, "Go to hell, I'm going back to Tennessee"
I said, "Angel, you can never go home"

Never go home
Never go home
If you wanna be an outlaw
You can never go home

So you wanna be outlaw? Better listen up, kid
Steal a million dollars and you have to keep it hid
Ain't no place to spend it in the desert if you did
And you can't take it with you when you go
Always something laying for you up around the bend
Everything that goes around comes back around again
You can't trust anybody, not a lover or a friend
Your momma, maybe, then you never know
Never do know (Never do know)
Never do know (Well you never do know)
If you wanna be an outlaw, then you never do know

So you wanna be an outlaw? Son, you better think twice
You better not pout and you better not cry
'Cause there won't nobody give a damn about you when you die
But the devil when he comes for his due
When you're standing at the crossroads, don't you try to flag a ride
Don't you fall down on your knees, don't you do what's already been tried
Hate to tell you but the only the left side is to sing the devil out of the blues

Singing the blues
Keep on singing the blues
Sing the "So you say you wanna be an outlaw blues"

Girl, don't bother in locking door
He's out there hollering
"Darling, don't you love me no more?"
You always let him in before now, didn't you?
He's just singing the same old song that he always sang before
He's the last of the hard-core troubadours

Now girl, better figure out which is which
Wherefore art thou Romeo, you son of a bitch?
You'd just as soon fight as switch now, wouldn't you?
He's come to make love on your satin sheets
Wake up on your living room floor
He's the last of the hard-core troubadours

And now he's the last of the all night do right
Stand beneath your window till daylight
He's the last of the hard-core troubadours
Baby, what you waiting for?

Girl, figure out what you're gonna do
When he moves on again and he leaves you alone and blue
But you knew he is just passing through now, didn't you?
And now you can't just say this is the last time, baby
Like you always did before
He's the last of the hard-core troubadours
And now he's the last of the all night do right
Stand beneath your window till daylight
He's the last of the hard-core troubadours
Baby, what you waiting for?

He's the last of the all night, do right

Well, I'm a-cuttin' out a firebreak line
Cuttin' out a firebreak line
Digging down deep to the clay and lime
Cuttin' out a firebreak line

Well I'm a wildfire fighting fool
On the Yellow Mountain hotshot crew
I can swamp and fell
I can walk through hell
I'm an EMT and a torch-man too
When the wind's blowin' hot and dry
And the sparks and the cinders fly
I'll make my stand with twenty good men
A better band of brother's you'll never find
Got their back and they got mine
I'm cuttin' out a firebreak line

Well, I'm cuttin' out a firebreak line
Cuttin' out a firebreak line
Digging down deep to the clay and lime
I'm cuttin' out a firebreak line

Ed Pulaski is a friend of mine
When I'm cuttin' out a firebreak line
He invented this thing like an ax I swing
And he never left a member of his crew behind
When the fire jumped across the line
Took 'em down an abandoned mine
Then he drew his gun, said he'd shoot the first one
That got it in his head to try and step outside
Got everybody out alive
Ed Pulaski is a friend of mine
And I'm cuttin' out a firebreak line
Cuttin' out a firebreak line
Digging down deep to the clay and lime
Cuttin' out a firebreak line
Woo!

Cuttin' out a firebreak line
Cuttin' out a firebreak line
Digging down deep to the clay and lime
Cuttin' out a firebreak line

Gotta pray that the wind'll die
And it rains down from on high
I will raise a glass to the hotshots past
In hotshot heaven up above the sky
They're watchin' over me when I'm
Cuttin' out a firebreak line

Now I'm cuttin' out a firebreak line
Cuttin' out a firebreak line
Digging down deep to the clay and lime
I'm cuttin' out a firebreak line
Whoa I'm cuttin' out a firebreak line

Jimmy joined the Army because he had no place to go
There ain't nobody hiring here since all the jobs went down to Mexico
Reckon that he'd learn himself a trade, maybe see the world
Move to the city someday and marry a black-haired girl
Somebody somewhere had another plan
Now he's got a rifle in his hand
Rollin' into Baghdad, wondering how he got this far
Just another poor boy off to fight a rich man's war

Bobby had an eagle and a flag tattooed on his arm
Red, white, and blue to the bone when he landed in Kandahar
Left behind a pretty young wife and a baby girl
A stack of overdue bills and went off to save the world
It's been a year now and he's still there
Chasing ghosts in thin, dry air
Meanwhile back at home, finance company took his car
He's just another poor boy off to fight a rich man's war

Ah when will we ever learn?
When will we ever see?
Stand up and take our turn
From telling ourselves we're free
Ali was the second son of a second son
Grew up in Gaza throwing bottles and rocks when the tanks would come
Ain't nothing else to do around here, it's just a game children play
Ah something about living in fear all your life makes you hard that way
He answered when he got the call
Wrapped himself in death and he praised Allah
A fat man in a new Mercedes drove him to the door
Just another poor boy off to fight a rich man's warEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Goodbye Michelangelo
Ain't no trouble where you go
Ain't no pain to burn you blind
Just enough to draw a line
Goodbye maestro, fare thee well
Gone to heaven, been to hell
Maybe just New Mexico
Goodbye Michelangelo

So long my captain, adios
Sail upon the sea of ghosts
Chase the white whale to the end
Bring the story back again
Iâ€™m bound to follow you some day
You have always shown the way
So we knew where we had to go
Goodbye Michelangelo


Oh, Susanna don't you cry
He'll find you by and by
Just like you did before
This ain't forever, it's just
Goodbye 'till it comes my time
I won't have to travel blind
Taught me everything I know

It's Christmas time in Washington
The Democrats rehearsed
Getting into gear for four more years
Things not getting worse
The Republicans drink whiskey neat
And thanked their lucky stars
They said, "He cannot seek another term
They'll be no more FDRs"
And I sat home in Tennessee
Just staring at the screen
With an uneasy feeling in my chest
I'm wondering what it means

So come back, Woody Guthrie
Now, come back to us now
Tear your eyes from paradise
And rise again somehow
If you run into Jesus
Maybe he can help you out
Come back, Woody Guthrie
To us now

I followed in your footsteps once
Back in my traveling days
Somewhere I failed to find your trail
Now I'm stumbling through the haze
But there's killers on the highway now
And a man can't get around
So I sold my soul for wheels that roll
Now I'm stuck here in this town
Come back, Woody Guthrie
Come back to us now
Tear your eyes from paradise
And rise again somehow
If you run into Jesus
Maybe he can help us out
Come back, Woody Guthrie
To us now

There's foxes in the henhouse
Cows out in the corn
The unions have been busted
Their proud red banners torn
To listen to the radio
You'd think that all was well
But you and me and Cisco know
It's going straight to hell

So come back, Emma Goldman
Rise up, old Joe Hill
The barricades are going up
They cannot break our will
Come back to us, Malcolm X
And Martin Luther King
We're marching into Selma
As the bells of freedom ring
So come back, Woody Guthrie
Come back to us now
Tear your eyes from paradise
And rise again somehowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I am the Kilrain, I'm a fightin' man
And I come from County Clare
And the Brits would hang me for a Fenian
So I took my leave of there
And I crossed the ocean in the Arrianne
The vilest tub afloat
And the captain's brother was a railroad man
And he met us at the boat
So I joined up with the 20th Maine
Like I said, my friend, I'm a fighting man
Marchin' south in the pouring rain
We're all goin' down to Dixieland
I am Kilrain of the 20th Maine
And we fight for Chamberlain
'Cause he stood right with us
When the Johnnies came like a banshee on the wind
When the smoke cleared out of Gettysburg
Many a mother wept
For many a good boy died there, sure
And the air smelled just like death
I am Kilrain of the 20th Maine
And I'd march to hell and back again
For Colonel Joshua Chamberlain
We're all goin' down to Dixieland
I am the Kilrain of the 20th Maine
And I damn all gentlemen
Whose only worth is their father's name
And the sweat of a workin' man
Well, we come from the farms and the city streets
A hundred foreign lands
And we spilled our blood in the battle's heat
Now we're all Americans
I am the Kilrain of the 20th Maine
And did I tell you, friend, I'm a fightin' man
And I'll not be back this way again

And the blind shall see again, it's all the same

I'm just an American boy raised on MTV
And I've seen all the kids in the soda pop ads
But none of 'em looked like me
So I started lookin' around for a light out of the dim
And the first thing I heard that made sense was the word
Of Muhammad, peace be upon him

A shadu la ilaha illa Allah
There's no God but God
If my daddy could see me now, chains around my feet
He don't understand that sometimes a man
Has got to fight for what he believes
And I believe God is great, all praise due to him
And if I should die, I'd rise up to the sky
Just like Jesus, peace be upon him

A shadu la ilaha illa Allah
There's no God but God
We came to fight the Jihad and our hearts were pure and strong
And death filled the air, we all offered up prayers
And prepared for our martyrdom
Ah, but Allah had some other plan, some secret not revealed
Now they're draggin' me back
With my head in a sack to the land of the infidel
