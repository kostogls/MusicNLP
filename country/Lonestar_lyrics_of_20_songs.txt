Every time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby, when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away

I've never been this close to anyone, or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I want to spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you

The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby, you surround me
You touch every place in my heart
Oh, it feels like the first time every time
I want to spend the whole night in your eyes

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I want to spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you


Every little thing that you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do (Every little thing that you do)

Got a picture of you I carry in my heart
Close my eyes to see it when the world gets dark
Got a memory of you I carry in my soul
I wrap it close around me when the nights get cold
If you asked me how I'm doin' I'd say just fine
But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind

Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
After all this time you're still with me it's true
Somehow you remain locked so deep inside
Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by

I still wait for the phone in the middle of the night
Thinkin' you might call me if your dreams don't turn out right
And it still amazes me that I lie here in the dark
Wishin' you were next to me, with your head against my heart
If you asked me how I'm doing I'd say just fine
But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind

Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
After all this time you're still with me it's true
Somehow you remain locked so deep inside
Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by
Minutes turn to hours, and the hours to days
Seems it's been forever that I've felt this way

Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
After all this time you're still with me it's true
Oh, somehow you remain locked so deep inside
Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by
That I don't think of you2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Ooh, yeah
Woo, yeah
Yeah oh yeah

The only ground I ever owned was stickin' to my shoes
Now I look at my front porch at this panoramic view
I can sit and watch the fields fill up with rays of golden sun
Or watch the moon lay on the fences like that's where it was hung

My blessings aren't in front of me
It's not about the land
I'll never beat the view
Of my front porch looking in

There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in
I've traveled here and everywhere following my job
I've seen the paintings from the air brushed by the hand of God
The mountains and the canyons reach from sea to shining sea
But I can't wait to get back home to the one He made for me

'Cause anywhere I'll ever go
And everywhere I've been
Nothing takes my breath away
Like my front porch looking in

There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in

I've seen what beautiful is about
When I'm looking in
Not when I'm looking out
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Oh, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in, yeah
Oh, there's a carrot top who can barely walk
(From my front porch looking in)
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong, yeah
And the most beautiful girl holding both of them, oh, yeah
(Beautiful girl)

He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
But when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
Said "Daddy when you coming home"
He said the first thing that came to his mind

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there

She got back on the phone
Said I really miss you darling
Don't worry about the kids they'll be alright
Wish I was in your arms
Lying right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes
I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there

We may be a thousand miles apart
But I'll be with you wherever you are

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there

Oh, yeah

Lost my job, came home mad
Got a hug and a kiss and "that's too bad"
She said, "I can go to work until you find another job"
I thought, I like the sound of that
Watch TV and take long naps
Go from a hard working dad to being Mr. Mom

Well
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday Mr. Mom

Football, soccer, and ballet
Squeeze in Scouts and PTA
And there's that shopping list she left that's seven pages long
How much smoke can one stove make?
The kids won't eat my charcoal cake
It's more than any man can take
Being Mr. Mom
Well
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the sixteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday Mr. Mom

Before I fall in bed tonight
If the dog didn't eat the classifieds
I'm gonna look just one more time

'Cause
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the eighteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
Oh, been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday Mr. Mom
Oh, Mr. Mom
Balancin' checkbooks, juggling bills
Thought there was nothing to it
Baby, now I know how you feel
What I don't know is how you do it
Oh
Honey, you're my hero2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Put on my blue suede shoes and I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy - won't you look down over me
'Cause I got a first-class ticket
And I'm blue as a boy can be

Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

Saw the ghost of Elvis
Down on Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
And watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered 'round his tomb
There's a pretty little thing
Waitin' on "The King"
Down in the Jungle Room

Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?
They've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
You got a prayer in Memphis

Now Muriel plays the piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
She said
"Tell me are you a Christian"
And I said "Ma'am I am tonight"

Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?
Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale

She said "It's just a woman thing" and pulled out of the drive
I said not to worry, I'm an understanding guy
I've heard that when you love someone you gotta let 'em go
She hollered "When I find myself you'll be the first to know"
Ooh hoo no news

I learned to do the laundry, feed the cat, and clean the house
I promised to be patient while she worked her problems out
When she packed her bags, her destination wasn't clear
But I sensed that her intentions were honest and sincere
Ooh hoo no news

She could telephone, tell a friend, tell a lie about where she's been
Send a pigeon, send a fax, write it on a post-it pad
Send a signal up in smoke, tap it out in Morse Code
I'd prefer a bad excuse to no news

Her mama's been a little vague as to her whereabouts
Her sister says "I'm certain your romance is headed south"
I don't have a single doubt that she's still in love
My level of anxiety is just a product of
Ooh hoo no news
She could telephone, tell a friend, tell a lie about where she's been
Send a pigeon, send a fax, write it on a post-it pad
Send a signal up in smoke, tap it out in Morse Code
I'd prefer a bad excuse

She missed her bus, missed her plane, surely this can be explained
Lost her car at the mall, got locked in a bathroom stall
Joined the cult, joined the klan, on the road with Pearl Jam
Buried with The Grateful Dead, came back as a Parrot Head
Got derailed, got de-iced, offered as a sacrifice
FBI, CIA, if they've seen her they ain't saying
No news
Still no newsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My husband's currently out in - at an undisclosed location in the Middle East. Uhm I wanted to say I love him and the kids miss him
My husbands in the military, we have a lot of neighbors that are gone right now
Uhm it's hard, not a lot of information, you wait three weeks for a letter and that's what you hang on to. My first deployment with him too so it's been tough

He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
(I love you and I miss you and you're my hero, I love you bear)
And when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
(Okay, hey, you guys come here, What do you want to say?)
A little voice came on the phone
She said Daddy when you coming home? (Daddy?)
He said the first thing that came to his mind
(I'm ready to cry)

I'm already there
(Now maybe I'll get him back sometime soon)
Take a look around
(I love him dearly and I can't wait until he comes home)
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
(I'm a Navy wife and my husbands over there)
I'm the whisper in the wind
(It's so comforting to have his pictures everywhere)
I'm your imaginary friend
(I miss him and I'm prayin' for everyone over there)
And I know I'm in your prayers
(And we're all prayin' for him)
Oh I'm already there
(I wear his wedding band around my neck all the time and I know he's with me, and I know he's out there doin' his job and it's the job he loves)
She got back on the phone
(We miss you, we love you)
Said, I really miss you darlin'
Don't worry about the kids
They'll be all right
(And kick the bad guy's butt daddy)
Wish I was in your arms
(Stay safe and be strong)
Lyin' right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
(This mornin' I had a dream about him and I rolled over in bed, I was so excited to tell him and then I opened my eyes and he wasn't there.)
So turn out the light and close your eyes
(It's been really hard on my mom)

I'm already there
(Come home soon)
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
(I'm proud to be an American)
I'm the moonlight shining down
(Thank you guys very much)
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there to the end
(We pray that you'll come home safely)
Can you feel the love that we share?
(USA, USA, USA, USA)
Oh I'm already there
(This message is for Corporal Macey, he's a brand new father today of a 9 pound 8 oz beautiful baby boy. )
We may be a
Thousand miles apart
(Tell him hurry home so we can get married)
But I'll be with you
Wherever you are
(Our daughter sleeps in his shirt so, yeah, she's only two years old and she wear this big ol' huge t-shirt to bed every night. but she won't go to bed without it now, so he's gonna have a hard time getting it back when he gets home)

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there to the end
(He's here let me tell you, everything we do, everything we say Austin says he's in the car too)
Can you feel the love that we share?
Oh I'm already there

This is for Master Gunnery Sergeant Garrett, this is his daughter, I'm very proud of him. He's been my hero, he's been my strength for my whole life. I just pray that everything's gonna work out
Hi dad I hope you're safe and I hope you come home safe and soonEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The sign in the window said for sale or trade
On the last remaining dinosaur Detroit made
Seven hundred dollars was a heck of a deal
For a four hundred horsepower jukebox on wheels

And that road rolls out like a welcome mat
I don't know where it goes but it beats where we're at
We always said someday, somehow
We were gonna get away, gonna blow this town

What about now, how 'bout tonight?
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about
What about now, why should we wait?
We can chase these dreams down the interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on and makes another round
What about now?

We've been puttin' this off baby long enough
Just give me the word, and we'll be kickin' up dust
We both know it's just a matter of time
'Til our hearts start racin' for that county line
What about now, how 'bout tonight?
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about
What about now, why should we wait?
We can chase these dreams down the interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on and makes another round
What about now?

We could hang around this town forever making plans
But there won't ever be a better time to take this chance

What about now, how 'bout tonight?
Baby for once let's don't think twice
Let's take that spin that never ends
That we've been talking about
What about now, why should we wait?
We can chase these dreams down the interstate
And be long gone 'fore the world moves on and makes another round
What about now?
Yeah, oh
What about now?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I can't quote the Bible
I skipped Sunday school
And I can't count the times I fell and broke the Golden Rule
So I don't know if he listens
Sometimes I wonder if he cares
Maybe I'm just wishing
'Cause I can't even prove he's there

But I pray
He'll watch over my children
I pray
Just to be a better man
To find the strength to rise above
To be there for the ones I love
To forgive and be forgiven some sweet day
I pray

Now I confess that I don't bow my head as often as I should
Mostly just when times are bad, rarely when they're good
And I don't hold with too much preachin'
But I was raised up to believe
That a man can't ever stand as tall
As when he gets down on his knees
But I pray
He'll watch over my children
I pray
Just to be a better man
To find the strength to rise above
To be there for the ones I love
To forgive and be forgiven some sweet day
I pray
So I pray
For a world that's gone half crazy
I pray
For every woman child and man
To find the strength to rise above
To teach each other how to love
To forgive and be forgiven some sweet day
I pray
I prayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Tell me what I have to do tonight
'Cause I'd do anything to make it right
Let's be us again
I'm sorry for the way I lost my head
I don't know why I said the things I said

Here I stand
With everything to lose
And all I know is I don't want to ever see the end
Baby please, I'm reaching out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Let's be us again
Oh us again

Look at me, I'm way past pride
Isn't there some way that we can try
To be us again
And even if it takes a while
I'll wait right here until I see that smile
That says we're us again

Here I stand
With everything to lose
And all I know is I don't want to ever see the end

Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in

I called about that conversation that I had with you last night
It must've been a combination of shooters and neon lights
And I didn't really mean to say I've been losing it since you left
Yeah, I may have said the words but they came from somewhere else

It was just the tequila talking when I told you I'm still not over you
I get a little sentimental when I've had one or two
And that tear in my eye was the salt and the lime
Not the memory of you walking
If I said I'm still in love with you it was just the tequila talking

I don't know what they put in Cuervo that got me to say those things
Usually I wouldn't care so much and make such a scene
But seeing you there in that dress you were wearing
Just drove me right out of my head
So don't hold me responsible for anything I might've said

It was just the tequila talking when I told you I'm still not over you
I get a little sentimental when I've had one or two

I wanna hear all about your day
There was a pile-up on the interstate:
I'm sorry that I got home so late
I thought about you all the way home
Can we leave the TV off tonight, unplug the 'phone?

I just wanna love you more than anything else
More than life itself, more than ever, baby
I just wanna hold you, feel your breath on my skin
Again an' again an' again
Let's shut out the world an' dim all the lights:
Baby, tonight, I just wanna love you

We could light a couple a-candles
An' watch the shadows dance on the wall
While we're movin' through the silence
To the rhythm of our own song
I don't wanna fall asleep tonight
Don't wanna think about tomorrow, baby

Innocence, our eyes meet
Pounding chest skips a beat
Suddenly I can't breathe
Two souls collide from 20 feet
A fire ignites and I believe
I believe

I can feel your heart

Fingertips touching skin
Without a word, both giving in
Self control is wearing thin
Wondering where this night will end

So you say your love's about to end
You say you can't take no more
She's out the door
And your looking for a friend
Who am I to tell you why?
But I'm just curious, were you furious
Or did you swallow your pride
And look her in the eye and

Tell her that you love her
Tell her that you need her
Tell her that you want her to stay
Reassure her with a kiss
She may never know unless you
Show her what your feeling
Tell her you're believing
Even though it's hard to say
'Cause she needs to know you're thinking of her
So open up and tell her that you love her

Brother I've been right where you are now
And my heart was broke
'Cause I never spoke
Those healing words out loud
But I've learned my lesson well
And now every night
Before I close my eyes
I look at my woman and
I ask myself did you
Tell her that you love her
Tell her that you need her
Tell her that you want her to stay
Reassure her with a kiss
She may never know unless you
Show her what your feeling
Tell her you're believing
Even though it's hard to say
'Cause she needs to know you're thinking of her
So open up and tell her that you love her

Tell her that you love her

Tell her that you love her
Tell her that you need her
Tell her that you want her to stay
Reassure her with a kiss
She may never know unless you

The shepherds are lit
A star in the sky
On the outskirts of town
A new baby cries
No room at the end
No crib to be found

The baby Jesus born in God's grace
So we all might rejoice on this day

Tales of Saint Nick
Tidings of joy

Can’t help but think sometimes
Baby about you and I
What if we’d never met
That thought scares me to death
Rewind to that first look
And that little chance you took
You sure walked out on a limb
Oh, thank God you did
Knowing what I’d do

If it wasn’t for you
I wouldn’t know what love is
I’d still be walking 'round
Looking into strangers faces
Part of a lonely crowd
I’d still be dreaming dreams that never come true
If it wasn’t for you

I wouldn’t know what it means
To have everything
Someone that has my heart
No matter where they are
I wouldn’t know what it’s like
To go to sleep each night
Lying here in the dark
The whole world in my arms
Feeling the way I you do
If it wasn’t for you
I wouldn’t know what love is
I’d still be walking round
Looking into strangers faces
Part of a lonely crowd
I’d still dreaming dreams that never come true
If it wasn’t for you
If it wasn’t for you


I wouldn’t know what love is
I’d still be walking round
Looking into strangers faces
Part of a lonely crowd
This house wouldn’t be a home
It’d just be doors and walls
I wouldn’t know the sound of laughter
Running up and down these halls
I’d still dreaming dreams that never come true
If it wasn’t for you
Oh, if it wasn't for youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I still remember the night we met
You said you loved my smile
But your love for me was like a summer breeze
Oh, it lasted for a while
I could hold on a little tighter I know
But when you love someone you gotta let 'em go so

I'm gonna smile, 'cause I want to make you happy
Laugh, so you can't see me cry
I'm gonna let you go in style
And even if it kills me
I'm gonna smile

Kiss me once for the good times, baby
Kiss me twice for goodbye
You can't help how you don't feel
And it doesn't matter why
Give me a chance to bow out gracefully
'Cause that's how I want you to remember me

I'm gonna smile, 'cause I want to make you happy
Laugh, so you can't see me cry
I'm gonna let you go in style
And even if it kills me
I'm gonna smile
I'm gonna smile so you can find the courage
Laugh, so you won't see me hurtin'
I'm gonna let you go in style
And even if it kills me
I'm gonna smileEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
