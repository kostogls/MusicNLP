She tried to hide it by the faded denim clothes she wore
But I knew she'd never been inside a bar before
And I felt like a peasant who just had met a queen
And she knew I saw right through her tight fitting jeans

I asked her what's a woman like you doing here
I see you're used to champagne but I'll buy you a beer
She said you've got me figured out but I'm not what I seem
And for a dance I'll tell you 'bout these tight fitting jeans

She said I married money, I'm used to wearing pearls
But I've always dreamed of being just a good ol' boys' girl
So tonight I left those crystal candle lights to live a dream
And partner, there's a tiger in these tight fitting jeans

We danced every dance and Lord the beer that we went through
I'm satisfied I did my best to make her dream come true
As she played out her fantasy before my eyes it seemed
A cowgirl came alive inside those tight fitting jeans

In my mind she's still a lady, that's all I'm gonna say
I knew that I'd been broken by the time we parted ways
And I know I held more woman than most eyes have ever seen
That night I knew a lady wearing tight fitting jeans
Well now she's back in her world and I'm still stuck in mine
But I know Iâ€™ll always remember the time
A cowboy once had a millionaire's dream
And Lord I love that lady wearing tight fitting jeansEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hello, darlin', happy birthday
I've decided not to give you a present this year
In fact I think it's about time
I took some things away

I'd like to take away the suspicion
That I know clouds your world at times
By giving you some faith to hold onto honey
Whenever your hand is not in mine

Happy birthday darlin'
I've no presents, no fancy cake
But I hope I'll make you happy
With everything I take

I'd like to take away some of your lonely moments
By spending more of mine with you
And I'd like to take away some of those so-so kisses
And replace them with ones that really say "I love you"

And I wanna take away the doubt you sometimes have about my love
By showing more...much more that I've shown lately
And then if someone should ask you what I've got you for your birthday
Well you can say, "Why he didn't give me anything but he sure took a lotta things away"
Happy birthday darlin'
I've no presents, no fancy cake
But I hope I'll make you happy
With everything I take
Happy birthday darlin'
I've no presents, no fancy cake
But I hope I'll make you happy
With everything I take

Happy birthday darlin'EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Joni was the girl who lived next door
I've known her I guess ten years or more
Joni wrote me a note one day
And this is what she had to say

Jimmy please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Saving all my kisses just for you
Signed with love, forever true

Slowly I read her note once more
Then I went over to the house next door
Her teardrops fell like rain that day
When I told Joni what I had to say

Joni, Joni, please don't cry
You'll forget me by and by
You're just fifteen I'm twenty-two
And Joni I just can't wait for you

Soon I left our little hometown
Got me a job and tried to settle down
But these words kept haunting my memory
The words that Joni said to me
Jimmy please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Saving all my kisses just for you
Signed with love, forever true

I packed my clothes and I caught a plane
I had to see Joni I had to explain
How my heart was filled with her memory
And ask my Joni if she'd marry me

I ran all the way to the house next door
But things weren't like they were before
My teardrops fell like rain that day
When I heard what Joni had to say

Jimmy, Jimmy please don't cry
You'll forget me by and by
It's been five years since you've been gone
Jimmy I married your best friend JohnEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I woke up cryin' late at night, when I was very young
I had dreamed my father, had passed away and gone
My world revolved around him, I couldn't lie there anymore
So I made my way down, the mirrored hall, and tapped upon his door

And I said, "Daddy, I'm so afraid!
How would I go on, with you gone that way?
Don't wanna cry anymore, so may I stay with you?"
And he said "That's my job, that's what I do
Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me
That's my job, you see."

Later we barely got along, this teenage boy and he
Most of the fights it seems were over different dreams
We each held for me
He wanted knowledge and learning, I wanted to fly out west
I said "I could make it out there, if I just had the fare
I got half, will you loan me the rest?"

And I said, "Daddy, I'm so afraid
There's no guarantee in the plans I've made
And if I should fail, who will pay my way back home?"
And he said "That's my job, that's what I do
Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me
That's my job, you see."
Every person carves his spot, and fills the hole with life
And I pray someday I might, light as bright as he

Woke up early one bright fall day, read the tragic news
After all my travels, I settled down, within a mile or two
I make my livin' with words and rhymes, and all this tragedy
Should go into my head and out instead, as bits of poetry

But I say, "Daddy I'm so afraid
How will I go on, with you gone this way
How can I come up, with a song to say, "I love you."
"That's my job, that's what I do
Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me
That's my job, you see."

"Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me."1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I see the sparkling little diamond on your hand
It's plain to see that you've already got a man
I can tell you're not about to fall for any of my lies
I see the want to in your eyes

Deep in your smile there's a quiet, soft desire
Like the embers of a once raging fire
You know I could light that fire again, you know it isn't wise
I see the want to in your eyes

How strong's a band of gold
Is it strong enough to hold
When a love has grown cold
And A woman wants a love, sweet and warm

How many women just like you have silent schemes?
How many men like me do they sleep with in their dreams?
You can stay or you can go and although I sympathize
I still see the want to in your eyes

I see the want to in your eyes1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

How's your new love?
Are you happy?
Hope your doin' fine
Just to know it
Means so much to me

Is I love you and I miss you
And I'm so sorry
That I did you wrong
Look up, Darlin'
Let me kiss you
Just for old time sake
Let me hold you
In my arms one more time
Thank you Darlin'
May God bless you
And each step you take
Bring you closer
To the things you seek to find
Goodbye Darlin'

Gotta try to find a way
To lose these memories
Of a love so warm and true
And if you should ever find it
In your heart to forgive me
Come back, Darlin'

People see us everywhere
They think you really care
But myself, I can't deceive
I know it's only make believe
My one and only prayer
Is that someday you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you
No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe
My hopes, my dreams come true
My life I'd give for you
My heart, a wedding ring
My all, my everything
My heart I can't control
You rule my very soul
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe
My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you
No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My prayers, my hopes, my schemes
You are my every dream
But it's only make believe (make believe)2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

As the midnight moon was drifting through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes looking into the night
Not seeing what you wanted to see
Darling, don't say a word I've already heard
What your body is saying to mine
You're tired of fast moves
You got a slow groove on your mind
You want a man with a slow hand
You want a lover with an easy touch
You want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
Baby, believe me I understand
When it comes to love you want a slow hand
--- Instrumental ---
On shadowed ground with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
Hey, we're drifting free like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night
Darling don't say a word I've already heard
What your body is saying to mine
If you want all night you know it's alright
I've got time
You've got a man with a slow hand
You've got a lover with an easy touch
You've got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
Baby, believe me I understand
When it comes to love you want a slow hand
You want a lover with an easy touch
You've got somebody
Who will spend some time with you baby
Not come and go in a heated rush
Baby believe me I understand
When it comes to love you want a slow hand...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There's a lot of ways of saying
What I want to say to you
There's songs and poems and promises
And dreams that might come true

But I won't talk of starry skies
Or moonlight on the ground
I'll come right out and tell you
I'd just love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darling how I'd love to lay you down

There's so many ways your sweet love's
Made this house into a home
You've got a way of doing
Little things that turn me on

Like standing in the kitchen
In your faded cotton gown
With your hair all up in curlers
I still love to lay you down
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darling how I love to lay you down

When a whole lot of Decembers
Are showing in your face
Your auburn hair has faded
And silver takes it's place

You'll be just as lovely
And I'll still be around
And if I can I know that
I'd still love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darling how I love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things my woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darling how I love to lay you down
Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things my woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darling how I love to lay you downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

God gave some a way of walkin'
Others have the gift of talkin'
They've all got a special way to please
Some men fall for a pretty face
Others go for silk and lace
I bet he knew He'd bring me to my knees
When he gave her
Those eyes, those eyes
Make me do most anything they want me to do
When I look in
Those eyes, those eyes
I know I will never say goodbye when I look into
Those eyes
There's been times I thought of leavin'
Find another place for breathin'
After all I'm just a normal man
I thought by now I would have done it
Somethings always kept me from it
The reason isn't hard to understand when I look in
Those eyes, those eyes
Make me do most anything they want me to do
When I look in
Those eyes, those eyes
I know I will never say goodbye when I look into
Those eyes
Oh, I don't know what you see in me
But you keep on pleasin' me
All my life I've been satisfied just to look in
Those eyes (they turn me around)
Those eyes (they melt me down)
Make me do most anything they want me to do
When I look in
Those eyes (they get to me)
Those eyes (they set me free)
I know I will never say goodbye when I look into
Those eyes...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Now I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
And next to me, my soon-to-be, the one I left behind
And Lord it's killing me to see her cry
She knows I'm lying here beside her with Linda on my mind

Yes I know that I once loved her
And I placed no one above her
And I never thought I'd ever set her free
But it just wasn't in my plans
The way that Linda squeezed my hand
The first time that I held her close
As she danced with me

She said, "I've loved you for a long time
But you're married to a friend of mine
And I've tried hard to never let it show
But my love for you is stronger
I can't hide it any longer"
And so I thought I'd better let you know

Now I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
And next to me, my soon-to-be, the one I left behind
And Lord it's killing me to see her cry
She knows I'm lying here beside her with Linda on my mindEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Except I can't sleep and I cry all night till dawn
What I'm trying to say is I love you and I miss you
And I'm so sorry that I did you wrong
Look up darling, let me kiss you just for old time sake

Just two kids from the country far from any town
And wherever I played Rose could always be found
Life was hard but we made it and as everyone knows
I was there when she needed me a playmate of Rose
Now years have passed things have changed since we moved into town
The little girl I grew up with is your woman now I found
And now the sidewalks of the city where wild temptation flows
Is her new playground and the playmates of Rose
So if you're the one that's holdin' her tight
Somewhere out there at night
Please don't treat her as if she's just another girl
From off the street
And please don't do her wrong for her pride is almost gone
For you see Rose means the world to me
I love the girl you found out in the world
The girl that every man knows
But I love her today so different from your way
For you see I'm the brother of Rose...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hey, Louisiana woman, Mississippi man
We get together every time we can
The Mississippi River can't keep us apart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
See the alligators all awaitin' nearby
Sooner or later they know who I'm gonna try
When she waves from the bank don't you know I know
It's a goodbye fishin' I ain't see you a while ago
With a Louisiana woman waitin' on the other side
The Mississippi River don't look so wide
Louisiana woman, Mississippi man
We get together every time we can
The Mississippi River can't keep us apart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
Well, I thought I'd been loved but I never had
'Til I was wrapped in the arms of a Mississippi man
When he holds me close it feels almost
Like another hurricane just had ripped the coast
If he can't come to me I'm gonna go to him
That Mississippi River Lord I'm gonna swim
Hey, Louisiana woman, Mississippi man
We get together every time we can
The Mississippi River can't keep us apart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
Well, the Mississippi River, Lord, it's one mile wide
And I'm gotta get me to the other side
Mississippi man, I'm losin' my mind
Gotta have your loving one more time
I'm gonna jump in the river and here I go
Too bad alligator you swim too slow
Hey, Louisiana woman, Mississippi man
We get together every time we can
The Mississippi River can't keep us apart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
Heey
There's too much love in thisMississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
Hey
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart

I can almost hear the stillness
As it yields to the sound of your heart beating
And I can almost hear the echo
Of the thoughts that I know you must be thinking
And I can feel your body tremble
As you wonder what this moment holds in store
And as I put my arms around you
I can tell you've never been this far before
I don't know what I'm saying
As my trembling fingers touch forbidden places
I only know I've waited
For so long for the chance that we are taking
I don't know and I don't care
What made you tell him you don't love him anymore
And as I taste your tender kisses
I can tell you've never been this far before
And as I take the love you're giving
I can feel the tension building in your mind
And you're wondering if tomorrow
I'll still love you like I'm loving you tonight
You have no way of knowing
But tonight will only make me love you more
And I hope that you'll believe me
'Cause I know you've never been this far before1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I've been looking for you all night long, darling
You got to talk to me
I want to tell you how wrong I've been
And I won't do it again
You know that woman didn't mean a thing to me
I hope I don't embarrass you too much
Here in front of all your friends
I'm gonna get down on my knees
Please let me make it, please I can't give you up
'Cause you've made love so good for me, so long
Don't take it away 'cause love don't come easy
Darling, I'm sorry I stepped over the line
Don't take it away, don't make me go crazy
'Cause I would follow you to the ends of my mind
From now on I'm gonna be the kind
Of man you can lean on
And when the waters of life
Get a little too rough or a little too deep
I'm gonna be your stepping stone
And oh, I remember all those nights
That you used to take right a hold of me
And you'd hold on
Please let me make it, please I can't give you up
'Cause you've made love so good for me so long
Don't take it away, cause love don't come easy
Darling, I'm sorry I stepped over the line
Don't take it away, don't make me go crazy
'Cause I would follow you to the ends of my mind...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

A child was born in Tupelo
In 1935
I'm grateful for his music
It forever changed my life

Oh I loved *"Love Me Tender"*
And how that boy could sing
But when he died I wondered why
Millions called him king
Tell me, who did they think
Who did they think he was?
Who did they think
Who did they think he was?
The whole world bowed and prayed
But it only makes me say
Who did they think
Who did they think he was?

He was born in Massachusetts
In 1917
The second child of an Irishman
Oh we all loved Kennedy
He was brave and strong and handsome
A helluva president
But when he died
Millions cried like he was heaven sent
Tell me, who did they think
Who did they think he was?
Who did they think
Who did they think he was?
The whole world bowed and prayed
But it only makes me say
Who did they think
Who did they think he was?

There was a child of Heaven
Born in Bethlehem
Just a simple carpenter
With worn and calloused hands

Oh He healed the hearts of many
So they nailed Him to a tree
With no one left to mourn His death
But the women at His feet crying
Who did they think
Who did they think He was?
Who did they think
Who did they think He was?
There was no one left to grieve
But the women at his feet crying
Who did they think
Who did they think He was?

Who did they think
Who did they think He was?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's your life, you say you need a change
Don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything
You say it's different now and you keep staring at the door
How can you walk away, don't I matter anymore
If being free is worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time
If we had known our love would come to this
We could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years
Well it's been fun what else can I say
If the feelings gone words won't stop you anyway
If being free is worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye timeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Last night I dreamed
I took a walk
Up Calvary's lonely hill
The things I saw
With my own eyes
Could not have been more real
I saw upon three crosses
Three men in agony;
Two, cried out for mercy
And a third man, He looked at me
And oh, the hurt in this man's eyes
It just broke my heart in two!
And it seemed I could hear him say
"Son, I'm doing this for you."
I knelt beneath the third man's cross
And slowly bowed my head
I reached out to touch his feet
And it stained my hand's with red
And when I heard him cry in pain
I raised my eyes to see;
The blood spilled from the third man's side
And some of it spilled on me
The third man wore a crown of thorns
Spikes held him to the tree
And I heard him say, "Oh God, My God
Why hast thou forsaken me?"
And there within the mighty crowd
The ones who mocked Him cried
"King, save Thyself if thou art King!"
And then the third man died
Suddenly, I heard the thunder roll
I saw the lightening pierce the sky
Then third man was still hanging there
And I began to cry
I saw the boulders fall
And heard the breaking of the ground
And then I awoke
And though I dreamed;
I touched my cheek and found
My eyes were wet where I had cried
A dream, I wished I knew
I can still hear the third man say
"I'm doing this for you."..EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Sing me a song of praise and glory
Help this wandering child to understand
That when I close my eyes in sleep eternal
I'll be clinging to a saving hand
I want you to sing to me about the rock of ages
And sing about eternity so sweet
So that when I take my last breath of life
I'll awaken at my saviour's feet
I want you to tell me about Paul and Matthew
And sing about my dear saviour's birth
And tell about his trials and tribulations
While he walked upon his heathen Earth
Come on and sing me a song of praise and glory
Help this wandering child to understand
That when I close my eyes in sleep eternal
I'll be clinging to a saving hand
I'll be clinging to a saving hand...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
