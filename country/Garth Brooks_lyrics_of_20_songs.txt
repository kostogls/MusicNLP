Blame it all on my roots, I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know, the last one to show
I was the last one you thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise, and the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you, said, "Honey, we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain"

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away
And I'll be okay
Yeah I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends, in low places

Well, I guess I was wrong, I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's alright, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean, to cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well I'll be as high as that ivory tower
That you're livin' in
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away, and I'll be okay
Hell, I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends, in low places

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away, and I'll be okay

But then, I've been there before
And everything is alright, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
I didn't mean to cause a big scene
Just wait 'til I finish this glass
Then sweet little lady I'll head back to the bar
And you can kiss my ass

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away, and I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis

Three thirty in the mornin', not a soul in sight
The city's lookin' like a ghost town on a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm movin' in
He's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have been

And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

Every light is burnin' in a house across town
She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown
Askin' for a miracle, hopin' she's not right
Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night

And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls
She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him, thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows

And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls
She runs back down the hallway, and through the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror, "He won't do this again"
'Cause tonight will be the last time she'll wonder where he's been

The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You're stubborn as they come, you'll never settle down
You'll always be the one who doesn't stick around
You make all the rules, you're set in your ways
You gotta have your freedom, you gotta have your space

But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feelin' things you never felt and spendin' all your time
Tryin' to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start buildin' up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

Go on and shake your head and tell me that I'm wrong
Say I'm just another fool and this is just another song
But I know how you are, 'cause I know how I am
And I'd give anything to go back and try again

But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feelin' things you never felt and spendin' all your time
Tryin' to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start buildin' up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know
And you best put this song on repeat
Maybe then you won't end up like me

But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feelin' things you never felt and spendin' all your time
Tryin' to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start buildin' up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go

I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell-bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing somethin' from each other
Not knowin' yet what that might be

'Til she came to me one evenin'
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night
That summer wind was all around me
Nothin' between us but the night
And when I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered that's alright
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much

We had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in each others eyes
We had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace
And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancin' with the wind
Although I know it isn't real, I just can't help but feel
Her hungry arms again
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

A little baby told God
Hey I'm kinda scared, don't really know if
I wanna go down there
Because from here it looks like a little blue ball
But that's a great big place and I'm so small
Why can't I just stay here with you?
Did I make you mad, don't you want me, too?'
And God said, 'Oh child, of course I do
But there's somebody special that's waiting for you'
So hush now baby don’t you cry
Cuz there’s someone down there waiting who’s only goal in life
Is making you sure you’re always going to be alright
A loving angel tender tough and strong
It’s almost time to go and meet your Mom
Now when she’s talking to you
Make sure you listen close
Cause she’s gonna teach everything you’ll ever need to know
Like how to mind your manners to love and laugh and dream
And she’ll put you on the path that’ll bring you back to me
So hush now baby don’t you cry
Cuz there’s someone down there waiting who’s only goal in life
Is making you sure you’re always going to be alright
A loving angel tender tough and strong
Come on child it’s time to meet your Mom18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You know a dream is like a river
Ever changin' as it flows
And a dreamer's just a vessel
That must follow where it goes
Trying to learn from what's behind you
And never knowing what's in store
Makes each day a constant battle
Just to stay between the shores

And I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

Too many times we stand aside
And let the waters slip away
Till what we put off till tomorrow
Has now become today
So don't you sit upon the shoreline
And say you're satisfied
Choose to chance the rapids
And dare to dance the tide
Yes, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

And there's bound to be rough waters
And I know I'll take some falls
But with the good Lord as my captain
I can make it through them all

Yes, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Yes, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So, I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart?

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes?

'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelin's for them never were revealed
So, I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel
'Cause if tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes?

So, tell that someone that you love
Just what you're thinkin' of
If tomorrow never comes3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Just the other night at a hometown football game
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them, the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if He'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
And just because He doesn't answer doesn't mean He don't care
'Cause some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me, in her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days, there wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what He's doin', after all

And as she walked away, well, I looked at my wife
And then and there I thanked the good Lord for the gifts in my life
Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
And just because He may not answer doesn't mean He don't care
'Cause some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered...
Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered...
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Lookin' back on the memory of
The dance we shared, beneath the stars above
For a moment all the world was right
How could I have known that you'd ever say goodbye

And now, I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end, the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain, but I'da had to miss
The dance

Holding you, I held everything
For a moment, wasn't I the king
But if I'd only known how the king would fall
Hey, who's to say, you know I might have changed it all

And now, I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end, the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain, but I'da had to miss
The dance
Yes, my life... it's better left to chance
I could have missed the pain, but I'da had to miss

Well turn that bottle up and drink it, crank that jukebox up and Hank it
Bartender, pour another round
Here's to our best bad decisions, situation no conditions
Oh, and memories we all need to drown
So, fill your cup and raise it up
Jump in and join the club
And float this whiskey river reservoir
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end of a dive bar

'Cause up in here you're not the only loved and left her
Lost and lonely one who's ever swam against the tide
Thinkin' this is your oasis, it's the safest of the places
That a broken heart can find to hide
So, here's a toast coast to coast
With a big old adios
To wishes wasted on them fallin' stars
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end of a dive bar

Yeah it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
For some barstool believers wear our heart out on our sleevers
Just goin' where the neon glows

Yeah, it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
Yeah, we're just never quite belongers, hanger on-ers way too longers
Just buzzin' where the neon glows

Problems, we all got 'em
Let 'em sink down to the bottom
Doesn't matter who or where you are
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end
The water's fine, y'all, so just come on in
To the deep end of a dive bar
Of this dive bar

Yeah she's nice, yeah she's pretty
And she's crazy about me
She's what every man's hoping to find
She's always a lady, and that's driving me crazy
'Cause after you it's like going
From whiskey to wine

Whiskey to wine
It's just not the same high
I miss the fire
The burning desire
We fought like we loved
And we loved all the time
We're no good together
But it's sure as hell better
Than going forever
From whiskey to wine

When I talk, he listens
He don't show up missing
He's patient, polite and refined
He's handsome, romantic
But the problem is damn it
That after you it's like going
From whiskey to wine
Whiskey to wine
It's just not the same high
I miss the fire
The burning desire
We fought like we loved
And we loved all the time
We're no good together
But it's sure as hell better
Than going forever
From whiskey to wine
It's probably best, we rejoin the rest
And try to have what they call a good time
And hope it's not showing, we're walking in knowing
That we're going from whiskey to wineEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

People say she's only in my head
It's going to take time but I'll forget
They say I need to get on with my life
They don't realize

Is when you're dialing 6 numbers just to hang up the phone
Driving across town just to see if she's home
Waking a friend in the dead of the night
Just to hear him say it's going to be alright
When you're finding things to do not to fall asleep
Because you know she will be there in your dreams
That's when she's more than a memory

Took a match to everything she ever wrote
Watched her words go up in smoke
Tore all her pictures off the wall
That ain't helping me at all

Because when you're talking out loud but nobody's there
You look like hell and you just don't care
Drinking more than you ever drank
Sinking down lower than you ever sank
When you find yourself falling down upon your knees
Praying to god, begging him please
That's when she's more than a memory
She's more
She's more

Because when you're dialing her number just to hang up the phone
Driving across town just to see if she's home
Waking a friend in the dead of night
Just to hear him say it's gonna be alright
When you're finding things to do not to fall asleep
Because you know she's waiting in your dreams
That's when she's more than a memory

Papa drove a truck nearly all his life
You know it drove mama crazy bein' a trucker's wife
The part she couldn't handle was the bein' alone
I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone
Papa called Mama each and every night
Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright
Mama would wait for that call to come in
But when Daddy'd hang up she was gone again

Mama was a looker, Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good 'ne, but the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama, Mama loved men
Mama's in the graveyard, Papa's in the pen

Well, it was bound to happen and one night it did
Papa came home and it was just us kids
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine
If he was lookin' to surprise us he was doin' fine
I heard him cry for Mama up and down the hall
Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall
That old diesel engine made an eerie sound
When Papa fired it up and headed into town
Oh, the picture in the paper showed the scene real well
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear
He never hit the brakes and he was shiftin' gears

Mama was a looker, Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good'n, but the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama, Mama loved men
Mama's in the graveyard, Papa's in the pen2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Somebody's gotta start the weekend
Somebody's got to unwind
Somebody's gotta find that honky-tonk
Out on the county line
With pretty things and a band that swings
That gets 'em all out on the floor
And if we're gonna get the party started
Somebody's gotta swing them doors

Somebody's gotta feed that jukebox
Somebody's gotta drink that beer
Somebody's gotta get all rowdy
And raise some hell in here
Somebody's gotta dance with the women
Spin 'em to a country song
I can do this night life all day long

Somebody's gonna need a shoulder
When that sad song plays
Somebody's gonna need to hold her
Tell her it's okay
Just let her know to let it go
And then she's gonna have some fun
If she needs some help gettin' over him
Somebody's gotta get it done
Somebody's gotta shoot that whiskey
Somebody gotta bust that rack
Somebody's gotta play that country
That ain't ever comin' back
If home is where the heart is then I'm right where I belong
I can do this night life all day long

Somebody's gotta go the distance
Somebody's gotta call last round
Somebody's gotta turn the lights on
And shut this ol' bar down
When mornin' comes you'll find someone
With a headache and a grin
You know Saturday night is comin'
Somebody's gotta go again

Somebody's gotta feed that jukebox
Somebody's gotta hold my beer
Somebody's gotta get a little crazy

Six o'clock on Friday evenin'
Momma doesn't know she's leavin'
'Til she hears the screen door slammin'
Rubber squealin', gears a-jammin'
Local country station just a blarin' on the radio
Pick him up at seven and they're headin' to the rodeo
Momma's on the front porch screamin' out her warnin'
Girl you better get your red head back in bed before the mornin'

Nine o'clock the show is endin'
But the fun is just beginnin'
She knows he's anticipatin'
But she's gonna keep him waitin'
Grab a bite to eat and then they're headin' to the honky-tonk
But loud crowds and line dancin' just ain't what they really want
Drive out to the boondocks and park down by the creek
Hey, where it's George Strait 'til real late, dancin' cheek to cheek

Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Goin' 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Ten 'til twelve is wine and dancin'
Midnight starts the hard romancin'
One o'clock that truck is rockin'
Two is comin', still no stoppin'
Break to check the clock at three
They're right on where they want to be
And four o'clock get up and goin'
Five o'clock that rooster's crowin'

Yeah, they ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Goin' 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up

Six o'clock on Saturday
Her folks don't know his on his way
The stalls are clean, the horses fed
They say she's grounded 'til she's dead
Well, here he comes around the bend
Slowin' down, she's jumpin' in
Hey, mom, you're daughter's gone
And there they go again, hey

I was feeling the blues, I was watchin' the news
When this fella came on the TV
He said I'm tellin' you that science has proved
That heartaches are healed by the sea
That got me goin', without even knowin'
I packed right up and drove down
Now I'm on a roll and I swear to my soul
Tonight I'm gonna paint this town

So bring me two piña coladas
I want one for each hand
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan
Oh, and never leave dry land
Hey, troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two piña coladas
She said goodbye to her good timin' man

Oh, now I've gotta say that the wind and the waves
And the moon winkin' down at me
Eases my mind, by leavin' behind
The heartaches that love often brings
Now I've got a smile that goes on for miles
With no inclination to roam
And I've gotta say that I think I've gotta stay
'Cause this is feelin' more and more like home
So bring me two piña coladas
I gotta have one for each hand

They packed up all his buckles and shipped his saddle to his dad
And by the way the house looked, she must have took it bad
The workers come on Monday to fix the door and patch the wall
They say she just went crazy the night she got the call

Well, he was up in Wyoming and drew a bull no man could ride
He promised her he'd turn out, well, it turned out that he lied
And all the dreams that they'd been livin' in the California sand
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne

They she just went crazy
Screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean
And to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water
You'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches
Of Cheyenne

They never found her body, just her diary by the bed
It told about the fight they had and the words that she had said
When he told her he was ridin', she said, "Then I don't give a damn
If you never come back from Cheyenne"
They she just went crazy
Screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean
And to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water
You'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches
Of Cheyenne

Nobody can explain it, some say she's still alive
They've even claimed they've seen her on the shoreline late at night
'Cause if you go down by the water, you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

Yes, every night she walks the beaches

***
Oh, the snowflakes fell in silence
Over Belleau Wood that night
For a Christmas truce had been declared
By both sides of the fight
As we lay there in our trenches
The silence broke in two
By a German soldier singing
A song that we all knew

Though I did not know the language
The song was "Silent Night"
Then I heard my buddy whisper
"All is calm and all is bright"
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me
Because I'd die if I was wrong
But I stood up in my trench
And I began to sing along

Then across the frozen battlefield
Another's voice joined in
Until one by one each man became
A singer of the hymn
Then I thought that I was dreaming
For right there in my sight
Stood the German soldier
'Neath the falling flakes of white
And he raised his hand and smiled at me
As if he seemed to say
Here's hoping we both live to see us
Find a better way

Then the devil's clock struck midnight
And the skies lit up again
And the battlefield where heaven stood
Was blown to hell again
But for just one fleeting moment
The answer seemed so clear
Heaven's not beyond the clouds
It's just beyond the fear

No, heaven's not beyond the clouds
It's for us, to find it, hereEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
