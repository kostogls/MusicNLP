You're not sure that you love me
But you're not sure enough to let me go
Baby, it ain't fair you know to just keep me hangin' 'round
You say you don't wanna hurt me, don't wanna see my tears
So why are you still standing here just watching me drown?

And it's alright, yeah, I'll be fine
Don't worry 'bout this heart of mine
Just take your love and hit the road
There's nothing you can do or say
You're gonna break my heart anyway
So just leave the pieces when you go

Now you can drag out the heartache
Or baby, you could make it quick
Really get it over with and just let me move on
Don't concern yourself with this mess you've left for me
I can clean it up, you see, just as long as you're gone

And it's alright, yeah, I'll be fine
Don't worry 'bout this heart of mine
Just take your love and hit the road
There's nothing you can do or say
You're gonna break my heart anyway

You not making up your mind is killing me and wasting time
I need so much more than that

Do you wanna run away together?
I would say it was your best line ever
Too bad I fell for it
And I walked along
Waiting for you to come along
Take my tortured heart by the hand
And write me off

Do you know I cry?
Do you know I die?
Do you know I cry?
And it's not the good kind

You forced me to become strong
And I just cried, being weak
And you think you know
And I would like to think so
But do you know that when you go, I fall apart?

Do you know I cry?
Do you know I die?
Do you know I cry?
And it's not the good kind
No, you're not the good kind
I'm tired of hiding behind these lyin' eyes
I'm tired of this smile that even I don't recognize

Do you know I cry?
Do you know I die?
Do you know I cry?
And it's not the good kind
Do you know I cry? (Do you know I cry?)
Do you know I die? (Do you know I die?)

I wanna paint my face and pretend that I am someone else
Sometimes I get so fed up I don't even wanna look at myself

But people with problems that are worse than mine
I don't want you to think I'm complaining all the time
And I hate the way you look at me, I have to say
I wish that I could start over

I am slowly falling apart
I wish you'd take a walk in my shoes for a start
And you might think it's easy being me
You just stand still, look pretty

Sometimes I find myself shaking
In the middle of the night
And then it hits me and I can't even believe this is my life

But people with problems that are worse than mine
I don't want you to think I'm complaining all the time
And I wish that everyone would just go and shut their mouths
I'm not strong enough to deal with it
I am slowly falling apart
I wish you'd take a walk in my shoes for a start
You might think it's easy being me
You just stand still, look pretty
I am slowly falling apart
I wish you'd take a walk in my shoes for a start
You might think it's easy being me
You just stand still, look prettyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

He was workin' through college
On my grandpa's farm
I was thirstin' for knowledge
And he had a car
I was caught somewhere
Between a woman and a child
One restless summer
We found love growin' wild
On the banks on the river
On a well-beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last

Like strawberry wine, seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
The first taste of love, oh, bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

Yeah, I still remember
When thirty was old
My biggest fear was September
When he had to go
A few cards and letters
And one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year
I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste
Of strawberry wine, seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
The first taste of love, oh, bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

The fields have grown over now
Years since they've seen a plough
There's nothin' time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've been missin' so much?
Yeah, yeah

Strawberry wine, seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh, bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine, seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh, bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

Got my headlights shining
Down an old dirt road
Smoke my cigarettes
I should quit, I know
The radio's playing
Old country songs
Someone's leaving, someone's cheating
On and on

I think I might like
The quiet nights
Of this empty life

'Cause someday, maybe somebody
Will love me like I need and
Someday I won't have to prove
'Cause somebody will see all my worth
But until then, I'll do just fine on my own
With my cigarettes and this old dirt road

See, I left another
Good man tonight
I wonder if he'll miss me
Lord knows I tried
But I think that maybe
The thing that I did wrong
Was put up with his bullshit for far too long
I think I might like
The quiet nights
Of this empty life

'Cause someday, maybe somebody
Will love me like I need and
Someday I won't have to prove
'Cause somebody will see all my worth
But until then, I'll do just fine on my own
With my cigarettes and this old dirt road

I ain't gonna sleep
I don't wanna dream
About the things that I used to need
I ain't gonna cry or go on living lies
I'm just gonna drive

'Cause someday, maybe somebody will love me
Someday I won't have to prove
All my worth
But until then I'll do just fine on my own
With my cigarettes, oh whoa
'Cause someday, maybe somebody
Will love me like I need and
Someday I won't have to prove
'Cause somebody will see all my worth
But until then, I'll do just fine on my own
With my cigarettes and this old dirt roadEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You let me in
'Cause after all
It seemed like the right thing to do
I closed my eyes
And let you fall
I wonder what you could possibly know
About breaking down that I don't

It's been awhile
Since I begged for
Anything but now I want more

So lay me down
I'm lonely
You don't understand me
And you'd never even try to
Anyway

I hear you say
It's not the same
I'm sorry
It's something I just can't explain
So shut your mouth
And hold me close
We both know it's better than being alone
Pre-chorus 2
I don't mind
Killing time
As long as I can't see it in your eyes

So lay me down
I'm lonely
You don't understand me
And you'd never even try to

If wanting you's so wrong then I'm wrong
I'll admit it
Time after time you'll realize you don't mean it

So lay me down
I'm lonely
You don't understand me
And you'd never even try to
Im sorry
Lay me down
I'm lonely
You don't understand me
And you'd never even try to anywayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I never had all the answers
I never had enough time
But I sure had all the reasons
Why you weren't what I wanted to find

I never laid all my cards out
You just wanted to play
The king, he waited on my doorsteps
While the joker and me went on our way

Maybe I was much too selfish
But baby, you're still on my mind
Now I'm grown and all alone
And wishing I was with you tonight
'Cause I can guarantee
Things are sweeter in Tennessee

These days everything is all business
Never in one place for too long
But there's no lack of arms around me
But I still wonder if somewhere I went wrong
Maybe I was much too selfish
But baby, you're still on my mind
Now I'm grown and all alone
And wishing I was with you tonight
'Cause I can guarantee
Things are sweeter in Tennessee
In Tennessee

And I'd wish on every star in the southern sky
For that man and our life if I did not think that

Maybe I was much too selfish
But baby, you're still on my mind
Now I'm grown and all alone
And wishing I was with you tonight
'Cause I can guarantee
Things are sweeter in Tennessee

Yes, I guarantee
Things are sweeter in TennesseeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Only crazy people
Fall in love with me
They come from all over
To be with me
Bank robbers and killers
Drunks and drug dealers
Only crazy people
Fall in love with me

He came from Carolina
On a west-bound freight train
He didn't have no ticket
But he got here the same
He left me a reminder
With nine months to go
That's why I killed his wife
And wrecked up his home

He fled Mississippi
With me at his side
A trunk full of money
And no place to hide
Well he loved his whiskey
And his fist loved my face
So I buried that man
And they won't find a trace
Only crazy people
Fall in love with meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Why do they make it hard to love you?
Why can't they even start to try?
'Cause now I feel a bridge is burning, oh
And all the smoke is in my eyes

I realize I never let them know me
I always wanted to be right
Took a mistake to really show me, oh
Exactly what they were like

I've been wrong, but I've been changing
I've been wondering what to do
Here I am alone and waiting
For you

Why do I try and make them happy?
Why am I always playing nice?
It isn't easy tryna tell you, oh
Exactly what's on my mind

I've been wrong, but I've been changing
I've been wondering what to do
Here I am alone and waiting

I took off my iron smile, babe
Cause i felt it weighed me down tomorrow
When the world wakes up, I'll be in another town
You don't know what you want at this moment, could be me
You move your hand across from me, turn me into some novelty

I guess I'm one more girl on the stage
Just one more ass that got stuffed in some jeans
It's one more day that you don't find true love
Because you don't know what it means, yeah

Did you ever take the time to think about who I might be?
Where i've been, what i'm thinkin, who i love, what i've seen
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, oh

One more crowd on the road
There you might pass on your way home
Someone sister, someones wife or just some bitch who's probably got no life

Some old girl on the stage
Just one more ass that got stuffed in some jeans
And it's one more day that you don't find true love
Because you don't know what it means, yeah
One day we'll be a pile of ashes
For the rest of time it passes
So take your hand off my knee
Do you know what it means to be?

One more girl on the stage
Just one more ass that got stuffed in some jeans
And it's one more day that you don't find true love
Because you don't know what it means

This concrete road used to just be dirt
We'd drive out here after work
Every Friday night when I was eighteen
This parking lot used to be a field
I parked here in my Oldsmobile
Long before the Sonic and the Walgreens

Not no more
Not no more

My, oh my
Look how the time flies
Look how the world changes in the blink of an eye
My, oh my
Look how the years have flown
Turning around before you know it
Up and gone
Oh my, oh my, oh my

Times have changed and so have I
I once was young and starry-eyed
Now I have these bittersweet memories
Songs were long and gas was cheap
No cell phones and water was free
Daddy paid and I never had to worry
Not no more
Not no more

My, oh my
Look how the time flies
Look how the world changes in the blink of an eye

Somewhere in the country
There's a place where nobody knows your name
When I'm feeling lonely, there's a train
That helps me run away

I know my mother
She always told me
The road would get cold
I never listened
Always forgettin'
The way back home
The way back home

Somewhere in the city
There's a face
That makes it hard to stay
He never listened to me
When I'd say
That things would never change
