The Devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said "Boy, let me tell you what."
"I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too
And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you."

The boy said, "My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet, and you're gonna regret, 'cause I'm the best there's ever been."

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The Devil opened up his case and he said, "I'll start this show."
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this:

When the Devil finished, Johnny said, "Well, you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done."

"Fire on the Mountain" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no

The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, "Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again
I done told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been."
And he played:

"Fire on the Mountain" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, will your dog bite? No, child, no19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I was taking a trip out to L.A.​
Tooling along in my Chevrolet
Tokin’ on a number and digging on the radio
Just as I crossed the Mississippi line
I heard that highway start to whine
And I knew that left rear tire was about to go
Well the spare was flat and I got uptight
'Cause there wasn't a filling station in sight
So I just limped on down the shoulder on the rim
I went as far as I could and when I stopped the car
It was right in front of this little bar
Kind of a redneck looking joint called the Dew Drop Inn
Well I stuffed my hair up under my hat
And told the bartender that I had a flat
And would he be kind enough to give me change for a one
There was one thing I was sure proud to see
There wasn't a soul in the place except for him and me
He just looked disgusted and pointed toward the telephone
I called up the station down the road a ways
He said he wasn't very busy today
And he could have someone out there in just about 10 minutes or so
He said, "Now, you just stay right where yer at!"
And I didn't bother to tell the darn fool
That I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go
I just ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar
When some guy walked in and said, "Who owns this car
With the peace sign, and the mag wheels and four on the floor?"
He looked at me and I damn near died
And I decided that I'd just wait outside
So I laid a dollar on the bar and headed for the door
Just when I thought I'd get out of there with my skin
These five big dudes come strolling in
With this one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth
And I was almost to the door when the biggest one
Said, "You tip your hat to this lady son!"
And when I did, all that hair fell out from underneath
Now the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight
In Jackson Mississippi on a Saturday night
Especially when there was three of them and only one of me
But they all started laughing and I felt kinda sick
And I knew I better think of something pretty quick
So I just reached out and kicked ol' green teeth right in the knee
Now he let out a yell that'd curl your hair
But before he could move I grabbed me a chair
And said "Watch him folks 'cause he's a thoroughly dangerous man!"
"You may not know it but this man is a spy
He's a undercover agent for the FBI
And he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan!"
He was still bent over holding on to his knee
But everybody else was looking and listening to me
And I laid it on thicker and heavier as I went
I said, "Would you believe this man has gone as far
As tearing Wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars
And he voted for George McGovern for President"
"Well he's a friend of them long haired hippy-type, pinko fags!
I bet you he's even got a commie flag
Tacked up on the wall inside of his garage"
"He's a snake in the grass, I tell you guys
He may look dumb but that's just a disguise
He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage"
They all started looking real suspicious at him
And he jumped up and said "Now just wait a minute Jim!
You know he's lying I been living here all of my life!"
"I'm a faithful follower of Brother John Birch
And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church
And I ain't even got a garage, you can call home and ask my wife!"
Then he started saying something 'bout the way I was dressed
But I didn't wait around to hear the rest
I was too busy moving and hoping I didn't run out of luck
And when I hit the ground I was making tracks
And they were just taking my car down off the jacks
So I threw the man a twenty and jumped in and fired that mother up
Mario Andretti would have be sure been proud
Of the way I was moving when I passed that crowd
Coming out the door and headed toward me in a trot
And I guess I should of gone ahead and run
But somehow I just couldn't resist the fun
Of chasing them all just once around the parking lot
Well they headed for their car, but I hit the gas
And spun around and headed them off at the pass
I was slinging gravel and putting a ton of dust in the air
I had them all out there stepping and fetching
Like their heads was on fire and their asses was catching
But I figured I had better go ahead and split before the cops got there
When I hit the road I was really wheeling
Had gravel flying and rubber squealing
And I didn't slow down 'til I was almost to Arkansas
I think I'm going to reroute my trip
I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped
If I went to L.A. via OmahaEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I ain't nothin' but a simple man
They call me a redneck I reckon that I am
But there's things goin' on that make me mad down to the core
I have to work like a dog to make ends meet
There's crooked politicians and crime in the street
And I'm madder than hell, and I ain't a-gonna take it no more

We tell our kids, "Just say no"
And then some panty-waist judge lets a drug dealer go
He slaps him on the wrist and he turns him back out on the town
But if I had my way with people sellin' dope
Take a big tall tree and a short piece of rope
I'd hang 'em up high and let 'em swing 'til the sun goes down

Well, you know what's wrong with the world today
People done gone and put their Bibles away
They're livin' by the law of the jungle not the law of the land
Well, the Good Book says it so I know it's the truth
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
You better watch where you go and remember where you been
That's the way I see it, I'm a simple man

Now I'm the kinda man wouldn't harm a mouse
But if I catch somebody breakin' in my house
I got twelve-gauge shotgun waitin' on the other side
So don't go pushin' me against my will
I don't want to have to fight you but I dern sure will
If you don't want trouble then you'd better just pass me on by
As far as I'm concerned there ain't no excuse
For the rapin' and the killin' and the child abuse
But I got a way to put an end to all that fast
You just take them rascals out in the swamp
Put 'em on their knees and tie 'em to a stump
Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest

Well, you know what's wrong with the world today
People done gone and put their Bibles away
They're livin' by the law of the jungle not the law of the land
Well, the Good Book says it so I know it's the truth
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
You better watch where you go and remember where you been
That's the way I see it, I'm a simple man

Watch where you go and remember where you been
That's the way I see it, I'm a simple man1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well the train to Grinderswitch is runnin' right on time
And the Tucker boys are cookin' down in Caroline
People down in Florida can't be still
When old Lynyrd Skynyrd's pickin' down in Jacksonville
People down in Georgia come from near and far
To hear Richard Betts pickin' on that red guitar

So gather 'round, gather 'round children
Get down, well just get down children
Get loud, well you can be loud and be proud
And you can be proud here
And I'll be proud to a rebel 'cause South's gonna do it again
And again

Elvin Bishop's sittin' on a bale of hay
He ain't good lookin' but he sure can play
And there's ZZ Top and you can't forget
That old brother Willie's gettin' soakin' wet
And all the good people down in Tennessee
Are diggin' Barefoot Jerry and the C.D.B

Well gather 'round, gather 'round children
Get down, well you can get down children
Get loud, well you can get loud and be proud
Well you can be proud here
Be proud to a rebel 'cause South's gonna do it again
Yes it isEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well the eagle's been flying slow
And the flag's been flying low
And a lot of people saying that America's fixing to fall
Well speaking just for me
And some people from Tennessee
We've got a thing or two to tell you all
This lady may have stumbled
But she ain't never fell
And if the Russians don't believe that
They can all go straight to hell
We're gonna put her feet back
On the path of righteousness and then
God bless America again

And you never did think
That it ever would happen again (In America, did you?)
You never did think
That we'd ever get together again
(We damn sure fooled you)
Yeah, we're walking real proud
And we're talking real loud again (In America)
You never did think
That it ever would happen again
From The Sound up in Long Island
Out to San Francisco Bay
And everything that's in between them is our own
And we may have done a little bit
Of fighting among ourselves
But you outside people best leave us alone
Cause we'll all stick together
And you can take that to the bank
That's the cowboys and the hippies
And the rebels and the yanks
You just go and lay your hand
On a Pittsburgh Steelers fan
And I think you're gonna finally understand

People say I'm no good
And crazy as a loon
'Cause I get stoned in the mornin'
I get drunk in the afternoon
Kinda like my old blue tick hound
I like to lay around in the shade
And I ain't got no money
But I damn sure got it made

'Cause I ain't askin' nobody for nothin'
If I can't get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
You just leave this long haired country boy alone

Preacher man talkin' on TV
Puttin' down the rock and roll
Wants me to send a donation
'Cause he's worried about my soul
He said, "Jesus walked on the water."
And I know that it's true
But sometimes I think that preacher man
Would like to do a little walkin' too
But I ain't askin' nobody for nothin'
If I can't get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
You just leave this long haired country boy alone

A poor girl wants to marry
And a rich girl wants to flirt
A rich man goes to college
And a poor man goes to work
A drunkard wants another drink of wine
And a politician wants your vote
I don't want much of nothin' at all
But I will take another toke

But I ain't askin' nobody for nothin'
If I can't get it on my own
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
You just leave this long haired country boy alone2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If you ever go back into Wooley Swamp son you better not go at night
There's things out there in the middle of them woods
That'd make a strong man die from fright
There's things that crawl and things that fly
And things that creep around on the ground
And they say the ghost of Lucius Clay gets up and it walks around

But I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
And I couldn't conceive it, I never would listen to nobody else
No I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
That there's some things in this world you just can't explain

The old man lived in the Wooley Swamp way back in the gurgling woods
And he never did do a lot of harm in the world
But he never did do no good
People didn't think too much of him
They all thought he acted funny
The old man didn't care about people anyway
All he cared about was his money
He'd stuff it all down into Mason jars and bury it all around
And on certain nights if the moon was right
He'd dig it up out of the ground
He'd pour it all out on the floor of his shack
And run his fingers through it
Yeah, Lucius Clay was a greedy old man
And that's all there ever was to it

The Crayton boys was white trash
And they lived over on Parvis Creek
They were a real snake and sneaky as a cat
And belligerent when they'd speak
One night the oldest brother said ya'll meet in the Wooley Swamp later
We'll get old Lucius' money and we'll pitch him to the alligators
They found the old man out in the back with a shovel in his hand
And thirteen rusty Mason jars he just dug up out of the sand
And they all went crazy and they beat the old man
Then they picked him up off the ground
Then they threw him in the swamp and they stood there and laughed
As the black water sucked him down
Then they turned around and went back to the shack
And they picked up the money and ran
But they hadn't gone nowhere when they realized
They were running in quicksand
And they struggled and screamed but they couldn't get away
Then just before they went under
They could hear that old man laughing
In a voice that was loud as thunder

Now that's been fifty years ago an' if you go back by there again
There's a spot in the yard in back of that shack
Where the ground is always wet
And on certain nights if the moon is right
And you're down by the dark footpath
You can hear three young men screaming
And you can hear that old man laugh

Me and my buddy got us a wild hair and figured we wanted to go somewhere
So we loaded up in my ragtop Chevrolet
We had a little bit of money and a whole lot of show
And with Hank Jr. blarin' on the radio
We got us a tank full of gas and we was on our way
We figured we'd go down to New Orleans
We were barrelin' down old 17
When a man with a blinking red light was on our tail
He said you were doing sixty in a fourty-five
But I'm gonna let you go this time
But if I catch you again, I'm gonna slap you in the county jail
We said "Thank you, sir, you sure been nice
And you ain't gonna have to tell us twice"
And we were southbound and down with the wind blowin' in our faces
We kept on rolling and pretty soon
The radio was cookin' out a Haggard tune
And we were pullin' into Houston and checkin' out all them places
I was feelin' dry and I said "I think we ought to stop and get ourselves a drink"
And old Jim said "Yeah, 'cause we got time to kill"
We kept on rollin' and I'd seen this spot
And we pulled into the parking lot
Of this place called the "Cloud Nine Bar and Grill"
We walked through the door and the place was jammed
The lights were low, they had a punk rock band
And some orange haired feller singin' about suicide
I said "Jim, this ain't our kind of place"
He said "Well, let's just have one round anyway"
So against my better judgement we walked on inside
Went up to the bar and we sat down
This fella walked up and said "I'll buy this round"
And he sat down on the bar stool next to Jim
He looked like a girl, but he talked like a guy
He had lipstick on and mascara in his eyes
And everybody in that place looked just about like him
I said "Jim, this ain't our kind of bar"
Let's just go on out and get back in the car
'Cause there's gonna be trouble
Ain't no sense in taking a chance
We was gettin' up, gettin' ready to leave
Somebody grabbed old Jim by the sleeve
Was this good looking girl, was asking my buddy to dance
I said "Jim, don't do it, there's somethin' missin'"
There's fellas dancin' and felleas kissin'
There's a fella in high-heeled shoes wearin' panty hose
He said "Partner, I just can't turn this down"
You just go over there and have one more round
I'll dance with the lady and we'll get on down the road
So he walked away and left me alone
And this funny looking fella kept comin' on
And he was makin' me mad with some of the things he said
And then he put his hand on my knee
I said "If you don't get your paw off me
I'm gonna locate your nose around on the other side of your head"
He said "I love it when you get that fire in your eye"
I said "Well, partner, try this on for size"
And I unloaded on him and he went out like a light
Everybody in that place must have been his friend
They all headed for me, I said "This is the end"
But where I come from we don't give up without a fight
They were screamin' and yellin' and scratchin' and clawin'
I was punchin' and hittin' and kickin' and pawin'
I was holdin' my own 'cause I've been in a scrap or two
Old Jim come runnin' up out of the blue
And that gal he was with come runnin' up too
And proceeded to beat on me with a high heel shoe
I grabbed her by the hair, it come off in my hand
And that beautiful girl was just a beautiful man
Old Jim just got sick right there on the floor
He dropped that dude like a shot from a gun
Smeared his lipstick, made his makeup run
And me and old Jim started fightin' our way to the door
Man, we lit out of there in that Chevrolet
And I put in on the floor and she stayed that way
We was goin' down the highway doing 'bout a hundred and ten
We was headed for home and we was gettin' nearer
Then a red light came on the rear-view mirror
And that same blame cop was pullin' us over again
Well, I'm sittin' here in this county jail
I had to call my daddy to go our bail
But I learned me a lesson that I never will forget again
I've done give up drinking, I've give up bars
And runnin' around the country in souped up cars
I'm goin' back where the women are women and the men are menEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

What this world needs is a few more rednecks
Some people ain't afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the workin' man
We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need

And I love them Rambo movies, I think they make a lot of sense

If you take 'em away from the criminals first, I'll gladly give you mine
And I don't mind payin' taxes but it makes my temper itch
When my hard earned money goes to make some politician rich
What most people call a redneck ain't nothin' but a workin' man
And he makes his livin' by the sweat of his brow
And the calluses on his hands
Now you intellectuals may not like it
But there ain't nothin' that you can do
'Cause there's a whole lot more of us
Common folks then there ever will be of you

Got on a plane in 'Frisco
And got off in Vietnam
I walked into a different world
The past forever gone
I could have gone to Canada
Or I could have stayed in school
But I was brought up differently
I couldn't break the rules
Thirteen months and fifteen days
The last ones were the worst
One minute I'd kneel down and pray
And the next I'd stand and curse
No place to run to
Where I did not feel that war
When I got home I stayed alone
And checked behind each door

Because I'm still in Saigon
Still in Saigon
I am still in Saigon
In my mind

The ground at home was covered in snow
And I was covered in sweat
My younger brother calls me a killer
And my daddy calls me a vet
Everybody says I'm someone else
And I'm sick and there's no cure
Damned if I know who I am
There was only one place I was sure
Because I'm still in Saigon
Still in Saigon
I am still in Saigon
In my mind

Every summer when it rains
I smell the jungle, I hear the planes
I can't tell no one, I feel ashamed
Afraid some day I'll go insane
That's been ten long years ago
And time has gone on by
Now and then I catch myself
Eyes searching through the sky
All the sounds of long ago
Will be forever in my head
Mingled with the wounded cries
And the silence of the dead

Because I'm still in Saigon
Still in Saigon
I am still in Saigon
In my mind
Because I'm still in Saigon
Still in Saigon
I am still in Saigon
In my mind2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Sitting on a barstool acting like a darn fool
That's what I'm a-doing today
Sitting here drinking trying to keep from thinking
I'm a boozing my troubles away
Well now I couldn't make her stay, well doggone her anyway
She can't say that I didn't try
Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one
I'm drinking my baby goodbye

Every time we disagreed
She was always asking me
Are you a man or a mouse?
Now that she's gone
She probably thinks I'm home
Just a moping around the house
She probably thinks that she's the one thing
I just couldn't get along without
Well wouldn't it surprise her I got a sympathizer
As long as these bottles hold out

Sitting on a barstool acting like a darn fool
That's what I'm a-doing today
Sitting here drinking trying to keep from thinking
I'm a boozing my troubles away
Well now I couldn't make her stay, well doggone her anyway
She can't say that I didn't try
Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one
I'm drinking my baby goodbye
Every time I try to sit down and talk to her
It always ends up in a fuss
I tried to reason with her right up to the time
She got on that Greyhound bus
It would be better if I could forget her
Because she sure forgot about me
And if takes all night I'm going to do it right
I'm going to sit here till I can't see

Sitting on a barstool acting like a darn fool
That's what I'm a-doing today
Sitting here drinking trying to keep from thinking
I'm a boozing my troubles away
Well now I couldn't make her stay, well doggone her anyway
She can't say that I didn't try
Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one

Call up Trudy on the telephone
Send a letter in the mail
Tell her I'm hung up in Dallas
They won't let me out of this jail
And if she asks you how I'm fairing
Tell her I'm just about to lose my mind
Worried about old Johnny Lee Walker
And the girl I left behind

Now John Lee Walker was a card mechanic
Had a hand for trouble and a eye for cash
Luckiest man in Dallas County
He had a gold watch chain and a black moustache
And he loved his whiskey and he loved his women
Drove a big long Cadillac limousine
Kept a big, fine, fancy town house in Dallas
And a hotel suite in New Orleans
Carried a switch-blade knife in his left hip pocket
And a .44 hog leg up under his coat
Cut you down in a New York minute
If he catch you cheating, that was all she wrote

So call up Trudy on the telephone
Send her a letter in the mail
Tell her I'm hung up in Dallas
They won't let me out of this jail
And if she asks you how I'm fairing
Tell her I'm just about to lose my mind
Worried about old Johnny Lee Walker
And the girl I left behind
I just got to town last Friday evening
Sure as hell didn't mean to stay
I was on my way back to Louisiana
Had a powerful thirst and six months pay
I met a peroxide blonde in a bar on D-ville
I was flying high and feeling mean
Poured down a bottle and a half of Red Eye
I dropped thirty-five dollars in the slot machine
And the boys in the back was a-dealing seven card
I sat down and won me a hundred and ten
I was raking in chips like Grant took Richmond
'Til big John Lee come a strolling in
He ripped off the table like a 707
Pretty soon, he done won all of my bread
I accused him of cheating, he reached for a pistol
I grabbed a chair and went upside of his head
Then I took off a-running like a motorcycle
Heard the bullets whining and the sirens wail
But it took half the cops in Dallas County
Just to put one coon-ass boy in jail

So call up Trudy on the telephone
Send a letter in the mail
Tell her I'm hung up in Dallas
They won't let me out of this jail
And if she asks you how I'm fairing
Tell her I'm just about to lose my mind
Worried about old Johnny Lee Walker
And the girl I left behind
Call up Trudy on the telephone
Send a letter in the mail
Tell her I'm hung up in Dallas
They won't let me out of this jail

And the girl I left behind
So call up Trudy on the telephone
Send her a letter in the mail

Living hard was easy when I was young and bullet proof
I had no chains to bind me, just a guitar and a roof
Emptied every bottle, when I poured I never missed
I had bloodshot eyes at 25, or was it 26?
It didn't seem to matter what price I had to pay
Because anything worth having I'd just lose anyway
Friends worried about me and they asked if I was sick
Thought I would die at 25, or was it 26?

Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Melting into memories like somebody else's life
I'm glad to say I've come around but if I could have one wish
I'd like another try at 25, or was it 26?

I met a girl from Georgia, smart and pretty college grad
I thought my luck was changing up till then it'd all been bad
Guess I fell in love with her, all it took was just one kiss
But she said goodbye at 25, or was it 26?


Yeah, I've been down that road before almost as far as hell
Deception or redemption I guess only time will tell
I have faith in the knowledge that God gave us a gift
I couldn't hide at 25, or was it 26?

I'd like another try at 25, or was it 26?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Stroker Ace was born to race
He had a mean streak ten feet wide
A son of a gun with a taste for fun and
More than his share of pride
Take a dirt road curve with the devil's
Nerve and make a car dance across the mud
Hauling shine was his regular line 'til the
Track got in his blood
Was a real hot shot and he bragged a lot but
Man that fool could drive
'Cause he loved the feel of the steering wheel
And the girls with the bed-room eyes
And in a racing tide or a bar room fight old Stroker stole the show
A back stretch blazer, a real hell raiser and a race track Romeo
Mama lock your daughters up
That wild bunch is back in town
And them little girls get frisky
When they hear that racecar sound
They're bringin out the yellow flag
Somebody's brakes have failed
There's an oilslick on the inside
And a wreck along the rail
You better stand on it, Stroker
Cause a bandit's on your tail
It's a downright joy for a country boy
When he hears them engines moan
But you gotta hang tough and it gets real rough
When you're out there on your own
Cause they'll push you around, they'll knock you down
They'll shove ya up against the wall
And you always know when an engine blows
And a man can't win 'em all
You could push that car
Just a little too far any Sunday afternoon
And if you break your neck
In some d---- fool's wreck they'll forget about you soon
But old Stroker Ace was born to race
And it's worth all the trying
Just to drink champagne in the Victory Lane
And to hear that concrete whine
Stroker get your dander up
This ain't no time to lag
You've got to make a lap up
If you want to take that checkered flag
Number ten is closin' in to even up the score
It's time to wave bye-bye and put the pedal on the floor
You better stand on it Stroker
Cause you're blowin' off their doors
Blow their doors off, Stroker
Stand on it, Son
Ah, you good lookin' devil, youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, ol' Catahoula Brown lived back in the swamp
With his dogs and a bunch of sons
One teenage daughter, her name was Sally Sue
She was as pretty as a newborn fawn
And he didn't like sinners, and he didn't like saints
And he didn't like anything
But as much as he disliked everybody else
He just hated ol' Silas Green
Sally Sue come in on a Saturday evening
As the sun was going down
She said, "Papa, if it's alright with you
Well, I think I'm gonna go to town."
He said, "Daughter, you get on back in the house
'cause you ain't going no place
'til you get them ribbons out of your hair
And wash the makeup off of your face."
She said, "Papa, don't you be so hard on me
'cause I just got a date
With this boy I met in Sunday school
And we ain't gonna be out late."
And then she walked on up to the rural route
And she caught herself a ride
But it wasn't no boy from Sunday school
That was sittin' on the other side
It was Silas Green's youngest son Bobby Joe
Sittin' under that steering wheel
(Chorus):
Alligator! Alligator! Swimming in the stream
Alligator! Alligator! What makes you so mean?
Alligator! Alligator! Wonder where you been
And did you swallow ol' Catahoula Brown?
I ain't never seen him again
Catahoula got up on Sunday morning
Made some coffee and had him a cup
Then he walked on out to the back of the house
To get his pretty daughter up
He went running in the room where the boys all slept
Hollered, "Get up! Somethin' ain't right
And I'm worried to death 'cause your darling little sister
Didn't even come home last night."
Johnny said, "Papa, don't be mad at me
I sure hate to tell you this
But I seen her in the town with Bobby Joe Green
And I even seen her give him a kiss."
"And I tried to get her to come on back
But she told me to leave her alone
She said they were getting married before the sun come up
And she wasn't NEVER coming home."
Catahoula grabbed the boy by the nape of his neck
And slapped him upside the head
He said, "Before I see her married to that trash
I'd rather see the little girl dead!"
And then he whistled up his dogs, and he grabbed his gun
And he was full of evil and fight
He went a-runnin' 'cross the woods hollering
"Silas Green and his bunch are gonna die tonight!"
Then a day went by and he didn't come back
And another went by, then a week
And when the boys went looking, all they found was his shotgun
Laying at the bottom of the creek
And then they found his boots, and they found his cap
But they couldn't find anything else
Except a big bad alligator, sitting on a log
Looking mighty proud of himself
It don't pay to hate somebody so bad you go
Stomping around in gator country
(Repeat Chorus)
Well, did you swallow ol' Catahoula Brown?
I ain't never seen him again..EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well you pass around the pipe
And you all get high
You never even stop and wonder why
Maybe it's because you want to die
Maybe it's just the way things have to be
Well you stay up late
And you drink too damn much whiskey
You know that sort of thing is kind of risky
Maybe it's just because you like to feel frisky
Maybe it's just because you like to feel free
Saddle tramp, how many people watch you riding by?
Like a thunder cloud that floats across the Arizona sky
And wonder if they're looking at a mighty happy man
Or just a lonely breeze
That drifts across the endless desert sand
Well it's getting kinda cold in Readosa
Abilene ain't getting any closer
One more drink, one more hand of poker
Because a fool and his money's going to have to part
You're too proud to ever show your sorrow
You don't steal and you won't beg or borrow
You may be here today but you're gone tomorrow
There ain't no strings
On your boot heels or your heart
Saddle tramp, how many people watch you ride away?
Wonder why you never promise to come back some day
Maybe thinking you were holding
All the pieces in your hand
Or are they slipping through your fingers
Like the endless desert sand?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Lamps in the windows burning bright, over in Santa Fe tonight
Full moon shining down along the border
But the ground is hard and the night is black
Over here by the rail-road track
And I wish to the Lord that I was back in Georgia

Blue water in the evening sun
Calling me when the day is done
Mama, mama pray for your son

All of my life I've been told
That the LA streets was paved with gold
Fame and fortune waiting to reward you
But it didn't take long to understand
California ain't the promised land
But at least a man's a man in Georgia


Well the St. Mary's River in the Georgia moonlight
Flowing under the Folkston Bridge
The sun comes up through the long leaf pine trees
Over 'round the Kingsland ridge
I may be here but my mind is still
About 90 miles north of Jacksonville
Well I may not make it, it's a long, long road
But mama I've paid all the debts I owe
And if I don't you know they going to find me trying
They took my songs and they took my soul
They made me hard and they made me old
Hell I just been born, but I feel just like I'm dying

The first things I remember
Are frosty Carolina mornings
With a cheery fire crackling
In my mommas big black wood cook stove
I remember snow flakes
As big as goose feathers
And the moon the colour of new
Made country butter and a night sky
Like diamonds against black velvet reaching
From horizon to horizon
I remember when the biggest problems
In my barefoot  life were sand spurs and Red ant hills
I remember sitting with my grand-daddy
On the front porch and watching the last
Of that magnificent southern sun bleed away
Into the twilight sky
I remember Sunday school and kneeling at the cross
And trying to imagine what God looked like;
Sunday dinner, short pants, hair cuts and a little puppy my
Daddy brought home to me and I remember love
I remember steam puffing, fire breathing
Awesome 10 wheel locomotives and the
Conductor's watch looked
As big as one of my grandmothers biscuits
I remember my mother smiling
In a red and white chequered dress and Christmas
Always seemed so far away. Yes, I remember you Carolina
Grand old lady of the South
I remember you as home
One of the memories that stays on my mind
About an old southern lady that I left behind
Is a ramshackle bridge where the deep river winds
And an old two-lane blacktop through the tall long-leaf pines
Carolina, Carolina
You're hard, but you're hard to forget

I still remember the magnolia nights
And goose feather snow flakes in the gray morning light;
Sand spurs and puppies and red autumn leaves
And the warm lights in the clear night on a cold Christmas Eve


Carolina I knew you
Before the highways got to you
And I loved you as one of your own
And I still do

Well, her name was Maria
She came from 
She had a passion for diamonds and gold
She done broke every heart
In Flueto bi Arta
By the time she was eighteen years old
Then she left for Las Vegas
With Senor Rodreguez
She didn't care what anybody would think
And when she came back
She had two Cadillacs and a mink
Well, he came from Kentucky
All the boys called him 'Lucky'
He loved to ramble around and have fun
A wild-eyed joker with a talent for poker
And a good lookin' son of a gun
Strong as a bear
Kinda devil may care
But he had a weakness, alright
For good lookin' ladies
And falling in love for the night
He met Maria in a small bar in Mexico City
Where him and his buddies had gone
Down to see the bullfight
He took on look in those flashy brown eyes
And said, "Here we go again"
When these high powered lovers
Got a look at each other
They thought it was love at first sight
They danced and got high
And then by and by
She came up to his room for the night
Then that high-totin' mama
Left for Yokohana
With a millionaire from San Antone
And when Lucky woke up
His loot and his lady were gone
Now he sits in Louisville drownin'
In sour mash whiskey
While she rides through the streets
Of Juarez in a long limousine
She took his pride
And a whole lot besides
And she just don't give a damn
I guess that's what you get
For fallin' in love for the night
I guess that's what you get
For fallin' in love for the nightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
