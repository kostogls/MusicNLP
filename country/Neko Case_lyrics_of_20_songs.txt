Chimney falls and lovers blaze
Thought that I was young
Now I've freezing hands and bloodless veins
As numb as I've become

I'm so tired
I wish I was the moon tonight

Last night I dreamt
I'd forgotten my name
'Cause I had sold my soul
But I woke just the same
I'm so lonely
I wish I was the moon tonight

God blessed me, I'm a free man
With no place free to go
Paralyzed and collared-tight
No pills for what I fear

This is crazy
I wish I was the moon tonight
Chimney falls as lovers blaze
I thought that I was young
Now I've freezing hands and bloodless veins
As numb as I've become

I'm so tired
I wish I was the moon tonight

How will you know
If you found me at last
'Cause I'll be the one, be the one, be the one
With my heart in my lap
I'm so tired, I'm so tired
And I wish I was the moon tonight

I'm so tired, I'm so tired
And I wish I was the moon
I'm so tired, I'm so tired
And I wish I was the moon tonight3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The most tender place in my heart is for strangers
I know it's unkind but my own blood is much too dangerous
Hangin' round the ceiling half the time
Hangin' round the ceiling half the time
Compared to some I've been around
But I really tried so hard
That echo chorus lied to me with its
"Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on"
In the end I was the mean girl
Or somebody's in-between girl
Now it's the devil I love
And that's as funny as real love
I leave the party at 3 A.M
Alone, thank God
With a valium from the bride
It's the devil I love
It's the devil I love
And that's as funny as real love
And that's as real as true love
That echo chorus lied to me with its
"Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on"
That echo chorus lied to me with its
"Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on"3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My true love drowned in a dirty old pan of oil
That did run from the block
Of a Falcon sedan 1969
The paper said '75
There were no survivors
None found alive

Trees break the sidewalk
And the sidewalk skins my knees
There's glass in my thermos
And blood on my jeans
Nickels and dimes of the Fourth of July
Roll off in a crooked line
To the chain-link lots where the red tails dive
Oh, how I forgot what it's like

Hey when she sings, when she sings
When she sings like she runs
Moves like she runs
Hey when she moves, when she moves
When she moves like she runs
Moves like she runs
Hey there, there's such deadly wolves 'round town tonight
'Round the town tonight
Hey there, there's such deadly wolves 'round town tonight
'Round the town tonight

"Hey pretty baby, get high with me
We can go to my sister's if we say we'll watch the baby"
The look on your face yanks my neck on the chain
And I would do anything (I would do anything)
To see you again
So I've fallen behind

Hey when she sings, when she sings
When she sings like she runs, moves like she runs
Hey when she moves, when she moves
When she moves like she runs, moves like she runs
Hey there, there's such deadly wolves 'round town tonight
'Round the town tonight
Hey there, there's such deadly wolves 'round town tonight
'Round the town tonight

Go on, go on and scream and cry
You're miles from where anyone will find you
This is nothing new, no television crew
They don't even put on the sirens
My nightgown sweeps the pavement, please
Don't let him die
Oh, how I forgot...2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

God is not a contract or a guy
God is an unspecified tide
You cannot time its tables
It sets no glass or gables
God is a lusty tire fire
Its bristles scrape and strike the stage
A rock-paper-scissors rage
Have mercy on the natural world
My voice is not the liquid waves
The perfect rings 'round a heron's legs
My voice a straight garroting wire
A stolen mile of fingerprints
Peeled up quiet from their dunes
Captured and re-spooled as ruin
To be used at a different time
My voice is a fracture
Of a shinbone's lust
Pounding barefoot ground
It lifts you up and sits you just
Just at sorrow's waterline
I drape you on tomorrow's plate
Ferrous, metal marrow spilling
Not yours but mine
I'm an agent of the natural world
Don't you tell me I didn't warn you
That that's some gravity you ought not to play with
Don't you tell me I didn't warn you
That that's some gravity you ought not to play with
Nothing quite so poison as a promise
Nothing quite so poison as a promise
Nothing quite so poison as a promise
Nothing quite so poison as a promise
And me, I am not a mess
I am a wilderness, yes
The undiscovered continent for you to undress
But you'll not be my master
You're barely my guest
You don't have permission to take any pictures
Be careful of the natural world
Nature can't amend its ways
Boils hell-on and then replays
Despite heartfelt springtimes of regret
The storm, she still cries for days
Have mercy on the natural world3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My love, I am the speed of sound
I left them motherless, fatherless
Their souls dangling inside-out from their mouths
But it's never enough
I want you
I carved your name across three counties
And ground it in with bloody hides
Their broken necks will line the ditch
'Til you "Stop it! Stop it! Stop this madness!"
I want you
I have waited with a glacier’s patience
Smashed every transformer with every trailer
'Til nothing was standing
Sixty-five miles wide
But still you are nowhere, still you are nowhere
Nowhere in sight
Come out to meet me, run out to meet me
Come into the light
Climb the boxcars to the engine
Through the smoke and to the sky
Your rails have always outrun mine, so I
Picked them up and crashed them down
In a moment close to now
Cause I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss
How you'd sigh yourself to sleep
When I’d rake the springtime across your sheets
My love, I am the speed of sound
I left them motherless, fatherless
Their souls dangling inside-out from their mouths
But it's never enough
My love, I’m an owl on the sill in the evening
But morning finds you
Still warm and breathing
This tornado loves you
What will make you believe me?4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I waited too long to write this down
The startling sensation is fading
The sweet, sweet burn
Of the first drink of the night, underage
Knowing that you're gonna get away with it
You were a good man before you knew it
And I'm not vain enough to think that
I'd have been good for you if I'd stayed
In the current of your life
I was an eyelash in the shipping lanes
And now I'm so scared about mystery
I fear I smell extinction
In the folds of this novocaine age coming on
I miss the smell of mystery
Reverb leaking outta tavern doors
And not knowing how the sounds were made
So I left home and faked my ID
I fucked every man that I wanted to be
I was so stupid then
Why should mystery give its life for me?

Baby, I'm afraid
But it's not your fault
Maybe I should go
Home alone tonight
Baby, I'm afraid
But it's not your fault
Maybe I should go
Home alone tonight

Now I see you in our old home
Where I'm always scared to go
Those thirty garbage miles
Making wet cigarette butts and used tires
To be poor as the anchor that makes us so sure
Your sandy voice across my brow
You haven't aged a day
Is it because you took a shortcut
That makes people say you're crazy
Is it true?
You're a time traveler, you
Is it true?
I've seen crazy too
Can it be a comfort between us?
Because I never want to know for sure

Baby, I'm afraid
But it's not your fault
Maybe I should go
Home alone tonight
Baby, I'm afraid
But it's not your fault
Maybe I should go
Home alone tonight
The instrumental over the bridge

Now I write this in a pale town
Where excitement is a yellow curb
My dream awake leaps through my window
From the highway
You turn my head and set the brake too late
Release the tears of metric tons
The crash, it comes (comes, comes)
And pours down my public face
Behind a reservoir of collarbones
And forms two private lakes (lakes, lakes, lakes, lakes)
Baby, I'm afraid
Your orbit is so easy
You haven't gained a day
We're two self-fulfilling prophecies
Who don't even have each other
Not that we would ever get away with it1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Woke a dog from a running dream
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Ate a black fly in the cream
And that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)
Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things
But that would have been bad luck

Are you tired of things going right?
Things going wrong?
Tired of trying to make everyone happy?
Too tired to sing your own songs

Do you wish you could stop everything
And take back your love?
Say you're sorry that you gave it up so easy
And cry like you're trying to be born?

Woke a dog from a running dream
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Ate a black fly in the cream
And that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)
Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things
But that would have been bad luck
So I died and went to work
So I died and went to work
It's not as bad as I thought it would be
But it's still pretty bad luck
It's not as bad as I thought it would be

I woke a dog from a running dream
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
I ate a black fly in the cream
And that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)
Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things
But that would have been bad luck

And love, the most contrary asset of them all
Dragging in on nature's coattails
Acting like it wrote the moon
Trying to pass riddles as poetry
Embargo is love's waiting room

And meantime
Right here in human time
My heart could break for a one-legged seagull
And still afford nothing to you (That's bad luck)
Are you tired of things going right?
Things going wrong?
Tired of trying to make everyone happy?
Too tired to sing your own songs

Woke a dog from a running dream
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Ate a black fly in the cream
And that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)
Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things

Early in the mornin' where there used to be a slough
There's a tiny business lake, don't let the cattails fool you
Down in the bottom where nothing is born
Sleeps a silver dollar with your face thereon

Wish I could trace the frowning compass of your mouth
Drop a Mercury dime down a Roman drain and summon Mars

Last lion of Albion
They'll use you for centuries to come
They'll steal your patents for the sun
And you'll feel extinction
When you see your face on their money

Late in the heavens that are already bought
Sleeps a red planet in the galaxy of a lion's thoughts
On the surface, every tendon and intended machine
Is gonna buckle, knuckle, kneel on a carpet of lion's tongues

Wish I could stand in the spray at the cliff of your sweet revenge
Ocean of naked serrated marble crushing in
Last lion of Albion
They'll use you for centuries to come
They'll steal your patents for the sun
And you'll feel extinction

Last lion of Albion
They'll use you for centuries to come
Your wound's the main road into London
You'll feel extinction
When you see your face on their money

Last lion of Albion
The last she-wolf to mother Rome
The last virgin to wash ashore
You'll feel extinction

Last lion of Albion
The last of the Mohicans, gone
The last cedars of Lebanon
You'll feel extinction

Last lion of Albion
Last tiger of Tasmania
The last she-wolf to suckle Rome
You'll feel extinction
When you see your face, face on their moneyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

A childless widow of a nation
You cry like guns across the water
Yet we expect you to bring springtime, it isn't fair
Searchlights wither in your hair
You are a silent movie, Sarah
Men build their industries around you
Diverting rivers of your hair
They're looking for their own reflection
You're left to die of exposure, Sarah
Sarah with the beaten heart
Sarah with the mouth of stone
Sarah with the -
You are a silent movie, Sarah
Let her go, the light is fading
I cry like guns across the water
She didn't ask to be your remake or your muse
We're parasites inside her blues
Sarah with the beaten heart
Sarah with the mouth of stone
I call but there is no one home
Sarah with the beaten heart
Sarah with the mouth of stone
I call but there is only echo
From a recording machine
Screaming "Haunt your own vampire dreams!"
You see our poets (poets)
Do an odious business
Loving womankind (womankind)
As lions love Christians, so
Who are you to deny?
Who are you to deny them, Sarah?

He led you to this hiding place
His lightening threats spun silver tongues
The red bells beckon you to ride
A handprint on the driver's side
It looks a lot like engine oil
And tastes like being poor and small
And popsicles in summer

Deep red bells, deep as I have been done
Deep red bells, deep as I have been done

It always has to come this
The red bells ring this tragic hour
She lost sight of the overpass
But daylight won't remember that
When speckled fawns graze ‘round your bones’
Who took the time to fold your clothes
And shook the Valley of the Shadow?

Deep red bells, deep as I have been done
Deep red bells, deep as I have been done
Where does this mean world cast its cold eye?
Who's left to suffer long about you?
Does your soul cast about like an old paper bag
Past empty lots and early graves?
All those like you who lost their way
Murdered on the interstate
While the red bells rang like thunder

Deep red bells, deep as I have been done
Deep red bells, deep as I have been done2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm a man
That's what you raised me to be
I'm not an identity crisis
This was planned
I'm a man
As in a citizen of mankind
It's what kind of animal I am
It's that simple, oh
I'm a man
And not just casually
I pull this barge full-time
The tree house cannot support me
I'm not the runt of the litter
The fat-finger bullies were no match for me
I still taste them in my teeth
I'm a man
I'm a man's man, I've always been
Make no mistake, what I've invested in
A woman's heart is the watermark
Of which I measure everything
I'm a man
That's what you raised me to be
I'm not your identity crisis
This was planned
I'm a man
You'll have to deal with me
My proxy is mine
You'll deal with me directly
And if I'm dipshit drunk on pink perfume
Then I am the man in the fucking moon
'Cause you didn't know what a man was
Until I showed you6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Weary sun, sleep tonight, go crashing into the ocean
Cut the line that ties the tide and moon, ancient and blue
We take our empty hearts and fill them up with broken things
To hang on humming wire like cheap lamps down a dead end street

(Close your weary eyes)
But every time we turn away
(Until the wintertime)
It hits me like a tidal wave
I would change for you
But babe, that doesn't mean I'm gonna be a better man
Gave the ocean what I took from you
So one day you can find it in the sand
And hold it in your hands again

Cold ways kill cool lovers
Strange ways we use each other
Why won't you fall back in love with me?
There ain't no way we're gonna find another
The way we sleep all summer
Why won't you fall back in love with me?

Combing over Broken Cross I held onto you
Haunted by the ghost of something new
Curtains fall, fashions fade, an endless summer over
Another tide to launch an autumn moon over the dunes
There must be a better way to pull a home apart
To keep the walls from caving in
Another way to while away from you, frozen and blue

(Close your weary eyes)
But every time we turn away
(Until the wintertime)
It hits me like a tidal wave
I would change for you
But babe, that doesn't mean I'm gonna be a better man
Gave the ocean what I took from you
So one day you could find it in the sand
And hold it in your hands again

Cold ways kill cool lovers
Strange ways we use each other
Why won't you fall back in love with me?
There ain't no way we're gonna find another
The way we sleep all summer
Why won't you fall back in love with me?

My brain makes drugs to keep me slow
A hilarious joke for some dead pharaoh
But now, not even the masons know
What drug will keep night from coming
There are so many tools that are made for my hands
But the tide smashes all my best-laid plans to sand
And there's always someone to say it's easy for me
But I revenge myself all over myself
There's nothing you can say to me
You never held it at the right angle
You never held it at the right angle
Catch a, catch a, catch a, catch a falling star
But wash your hands of it
Catch a, catch a, catch a, catch a falling star
Because you can't hold it
Did they poison my food? Is it cause I'm a girl?
If I puked up some sonnets, would you call me a miracle?
I'm gonna go where my urge leads no more
Swallowed, waist-deep, in the gore of the forest
Arboreal feast, let it finish me, please
Cause I revenge myself all over myself
There's nothing you can do to me
You never held it at the right angle
You never held it at the right angle
Catch a, catch a, catch a, catch a falling star
But wash your hands of it
Catch a, catch a, catch a, catch a falling star
Because you can't own it
You never held it at the right angle
You never held it at the right angle

So the saying says, "an elephant never forgets"
Standing in a concrete cave, swaying sad and insane
They walked over the ocean in their dreams they dream awake
Until the lights grew dim, until the cop cars came
Everybody tells me, this is crazy, yes, I know it
I'm a man-man-man, man-man-man-eater
But still you're surprised-prised-prised when I eat ya
You know they call them killer whales
But you seem surprised when it pinned you down
To the bottom of the tank, where you can't turn around
It took half your leg and both your lungs
When I craved I ate hearts of sharks, I know you know it
I'm a man-man-man, man-man-man-eater
But still you're surprised-prised-prised when I eat ya
Yes I'm a man-man-man, man-man, man-eater

I planned a dream inside a dream
With your uncle
A fisherman who died
The oracle of the maritimes
Too cloudy to see fireworks
We would ride
A chest of drawers into the waves
His granite hand held mine
I asked him how to tell you
How much I could love you
'Cause I've never been so sure of anything
Sometimes I feel so beautiful
It's strange for a tomboy
Bruises up her legs
Your big hand holds my face
Sometimes I feel so ugly
I'm afraid, worry nesting in my hair
Shedding like a Christmas tree
Surely there's a real woman coming to erase me
There's no way I could tell you
How much I could love you
'Cause I've never been so scared of anything
And I'm not even wearing underwear
In no way exotic, I just forgot to
And I'm too much for people, so I gauge
And shout my thoughts at you from a distance
And that's no way to tell you
How much I could love you
Though I've never been so sure of anything
He let go of my hand
And passed me an oar
The oracle of the maritimes
He said "Come on, sweet girl, let's find you an ocean
That goes with your eyes"
He said "Come on, sweet girl, let's find you an ocean
That goes with your eyes"EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm here to tell you a story
I'm here to tell you a lie
My poetry's weak and I know it
I was drop dead sad and crazy sometimes
So I fucked off, wayward cannon to the sea
On land I was just an appetite
All that started as a joke now ruled me
Sick on chronic mathematics
I just wanted to feel music
Her fever delivered me from the flu
The night hag's hands spread lovingly
Pulling the cape from the sunrise
And revealing a bank of warships called "she"s
Less warlike then reckless, I realized
No weapons were drawn that I could see
Save the blazing stare of their captain
Who held lightning captive firm in her teeth
So I looked off the edge of the world
I saw the girl who changed everything
That's when I met Winnie
I wanted to be her sailor's tattoo
She sang me a song that was too sad for some
Struck up the band and filled up her lungs
Her mouth was sharp as the rib of a star
As she told no tame truths that would break our own hearts
We were warriors!
We clothed ourselves in the guts of our enemies
Who’d no respect for the wild
Warriors!
Long before hotwire safari park husbandry
And the joy ran through us like the welder's flux
We just wanted to be music
The joy ran through us like the welder's flux
We just wanted to be music
Her gravity pulled up my sad remains
Into the curve of her cunning bow
I've loved you so long, Winnie
I want to be your sailor's tattoo
I've loved you so long, Winnie
Blurring softly into youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Baby, why am I worried now?
Did someone make a fool of me
Before I could show 'em how it's done?
Na na na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na
I can't give up acting tough
It's all that I'm made of
Can't scrape together quite enough
To ride the bus to the outskirts of the fact that I need love
There were times that I tried
One for every glass of water that I spilled
Next to the bed, retching pennies in a boiling well, in a dream
That, at once, becomes a foundry of mute and heavy bells
They shake me deaf and dumb
Say someone made a fool of me
'Fore I could show 'em how it's done
It was so clear to me
That it was almost invisible
I lie across the path waiting
Just for a chance to be
A spider web trapped in your lashes
For that, I would trade you my empire for ashes
But I choke it back, how much I need love
Na na na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na naEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I hear overtones that make this another song
Out of reach of human hands
We don't have control
I use major chords to make this a sadder song
An effective manipulation
Moonlight reflected is many times stronger
I wrote this song for me
And now I let it go
From the island of the Texaco
I release it into the custody of my huckleberry friend
(Am I making pitch or honey?)
No idea why I feel strong
Am I making pitch or honey?
"It's the gift that keeps on getting
That's the shrapnel from your wedding," she said

That I'm beloved of the wild
And may you ever return

Magpie comes a calling
Drops a marble from the sky
Tin roof sounds alarming
"Wake up child"
"Let this be a warning"
Says the magpie to the morning
"Don't let this fading summer pass you by"
"Don't let this fading summer pass you by"
Come on sorrow
Take your own advice
This thundering and lightning gets you rain
I'm on a top secret mission
A Cousteau expedition
To find a diamond at the bottom of the drain
A diamond at the bottom of the drain
A diamond at the bottom of the drain
Mockingbird sings
In the middle of the night
All his songs are stolen and he hides
He stole them from the Whippoorwills
And the yellow meadow lark
He sings them for you special
He knows you're afraid of the dark
Come on sorrow
Take your own advice
Hide under the bed
Turn out the light
The stars this night in the sky are ringing out
You can almost hear them saying
"Close your eyes now kid"
"Close your eyes now kid"
"These old dreams are hid"
They are waiting
Waiting
They are waitingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Everything's so easy for Pauline
Everything's so easy for Pauline
Ancient strings set feet 'a light to speed to her such mild grace
No monument of tacky gold
They smoothed her hair with cinnamon waves
And they placed an ingot in her breast to burn cool and collected
Fate holds her firm in its cradle
And then rolls her for a tender pause to savor
Everything's so easy for Pauline
Girl with the parking lot eyes
Margaret is the fragments of a name
Her bravery is mistaken for the thrashing in the lake
Of the make-believe monster whose picture was faked
Margaret is the fragments of a name
Her love pours like a fountain
Her love streams like a rage
Her jaw aches from wanting and she's sick from chlorine
But she'll never be as clean
As the cool side of satin, Pauline

Two girls ride the blue line
Two girls walk down the same street
One left her sweater sittin' on the train
The other lost three fingers at the cannery
Everything's so easy for Pauline
For Pauline
