Well it's a strange old game you learn it slow
One step forward and it's back you go
You're standing on the throttle
You're standing on the brake
In the groove 'til you make a mistake

Sometimes you're the windshield
Sometimes you're the bug
Sometimes it all comes together, babe
Sometimes you're a fool in love
Sometimes you're the Louisville slugger, babe
Sometimes you're the ball
Sometimes it all comes together, babe
Sometimes you're gonna lose it all

You gotta know happy, you gotta know glad
Because you're going to know lonely
And you're going to know sad
When you're ripping and you're riding
And you're coming on strong
You start slipping and sliding
And it all goes wrong, because
Sometimes you're the windshield
Sometimes you're the bug
Sometimes it all comes together, babe
Sometimes you're a fool in love
Sometimes you're the Louisville slugger, babe
Sometimes you're the ball
Sometimes it all comes together, babe
Sometimes you're gonna lose it all

One day you got the glory and then you got none
One day you're a diamond and then you're a stone
Everything can change in the blink of an eye
So let the good times roll before we say goodbye

Sometimes you're the windshield
Sometimes you're the bug
Sometimes it all comes together, babe
Sometimes you're a fool in love
Sometimes you're the Louisville slugger, babe
Sometimes you're the ball
Sometimes it all comes together, babe
Sometimes you're gonna lose it all
Sometimes you're the windshield
Sometimes you're the bug
Sometimes it all comes together, babe
Sometimes you're a fool in love
Sometimes you're the windshield
Sometimes you're the bug
Sometimes it all comes together, babe
Sometimes you're just a fool in loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She makes his coffee, she makes his bed
She does the laundry, she keeps him fed
When she was twenty-one she wore her mother's lace
She said "forever" with a smile upon her face
She does the car-pool, she PTAs
Doctors and dentists, she drives all day
When she was twenty-nine she delivered number three
And every Christmas card showed a perfect family

Everything runs right on time, years of practice and design
Spit and polish 'til it shines
He thinks he'll keep her
Everything is so benign, safest place you'll ever find
God forbid you change your mind
He thinks he'll keep her

She packs his suitcase, she sits and waits
With no expression upon her face
When she was thirty-six she met him at their door
She said "I'm sorry, I don't love you anymore"

Everything runs right on time, years of practice and design
Spit and polish 'til it shines
He thinks he'll keep her
Everything is so benign, safest place you'll ever find
God forbid you change your mind
He thinks he'll keep her
For fifteen years she had a job and not one raise in pay
Now she's in the typing pool at minimum wage

Everything runs right on time, years of practice and design
Spit and polish 'til it shines
He thinks he'll keep her
Everything is so benign, the safest place you'll ever find
At least until you change your mind
He thinks he'll keep her, all rightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Noises in my head
And endless "should haves" rain on me
Like a storm, like a hurricane
Losses piled up like wood stacks stories high
Feels like I've been framed, I have no alibi
Used to be that all I needed
Was what I didn't possess
Yearning makes you who you end up as, more or less
Every choice I made that worked out
Was just a lucky guess, just a lucky guess

Adventures half discarded half held onto now
Dancing on the ledge to the edge somehow
Well I can still pick out the faces
Though I forget the names
In places that I've gone but the urge remains
To throw caution to the wind or is it to the stars
To hold out my open hands
To spite my empty heart
To wear my heart down on my sleeve
Just like a battle scar, these are battle scars

There's comfort in a late night kitchen radio
And in a letter sent, lists of what you know
And when you don't know anything
You make another one
It's good to write it down starting with the sun
And sometimes church bells, trees, and seasons
Marking times gone by
Sometimes starlings swell
Some tidal moons and filled up eyes
Sometimes everything at once
But sometimes just the sky
Sometimes just the skyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Saturday night and the moon is out
I want to head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm going to find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle want to beg for more
Going to dance to a band from Luzianne tonight

Well I never have wandered down to New Orleans
Never have drifted down a bayou stream
But I heard that music on the radio
And I swore some day I was going to go
Down Highway 10 past Lafayette
To Baton Rouge and I won't forget
To send you a card with my regrets
Because I'm never going to come back home

Saturday night and the moon is out
I want to head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm going to find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle want to beg for more
Going to dance to a band from Luzianne tonight
They got a alligator stew and a crayfish pie
A Gulf storm blowing into town tonight
Living on the delta's quite a show
They got hurricane parties every time it blows
But here up north it's a cold cold rain
And there ain't no cure for my blues today
Except when the paper says, "BeauSoleil is coming into town"
Baby let's go down

Saturday night and the moon is out
I want to head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm going to find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle want to beg for more
Going to dance to a band from Luzianne tonight

Bring your mama, bring your papa, bring your sister too
They got lots of music and lots of room
When they play you a waltz from 1910
You going to feel a little bit young again
Well you learned to dance with your rock and roll
You learned to swing with a do-si-do
But you learn to love at the fais-do-do
When you hear a little Jolie Blon
Saturday night and the moon is out
I want to head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm going to find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle want to beg for more
Going to dance to a band from Luzianne tonight1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Fare thee well
My own true love
Farewell for a while
I'm going away
But I'll be back
Though I go 10,000 miles

10,000 miles
My own true love
10,000 miles or more
The rocks may melt
And the seas may burn
If I should not return

Oh don't you see
That lonesome dove
Sitting on an ivy tree
She's weeping for
Her own true love
As I shall weep for mine

Oh come ye back
My own true love
And stay a while with me
If I had a friend
All on this earth
You've been a friend to meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, I woke up this morning, stumbled out of my rack
I opened up the paper to the page in the back
It only took a minute for my finger to find
My daily dose of destiny under my sign
My eyes just about popped out of my head
It said, "The stars are stacked against you girl, get back in bed"

I feel lucky, I feel lucky, yeah
No Professor Doom going to stand in my way
Mmm, I feel lucky today

Well, I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk
The pot's eleven million so I called in sick to work
I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's
Crossed against the light, made a beeline for the park
The sky began to thunder, wind began to moan
I heard a voice above me saying, "Girl, you better get back home"

But I feel lucky, oh, oh, oh, I feel lucky, yeah
No tropical depression going to steal my sun away
Mmm, I feel lucky today
Now eleven million later, I was sitting at the bar
I'd bought the house a double and the waitress a new car
Dwight Yoakam's in the corner trying to catch my eye
Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh
The moral of this story, it's simple but it's true
Hey the stars might lie but the numbers never do
{Chorus]
I feel lucky
Oh, oh, oh
I feel lucky, yeah
Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, boys, you don't have to fight
Hot dog, I'm feeling lucky tonight

I feel lucky, brr, I feel lucky, yeah
Think I'll flip a coin, I'm a winner either way
Mmm, I feel lucky todayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Is it too much to ask
I want a comfortable bed that won't hurt my back
Food to fill me up
And warm clothes and all that stuff

Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have all of this, and

Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, woh oh oh
Passionate kisses from you

Is it too much to demand
I want a full house and a rock and roll band
Pens that won't run out of ink
And cool quiet and time to think

Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have all of this, and
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, woh oh oh
Passionate kisses from you

Do I want too much?
Am I going overboard to want that touch
I shout it out to the night
"Give me what I deserve, cause it's my right"

Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have all of this, and

Some people remember the first time
Some can't forget the last
Some just select what they want to from the past
It's a song that you danced to in high school
It's a moon you tried to bring down
On a four in the morning drive
Through the streets of town

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand

It's a photograph taken in Paris
At the end of the honeymoon
In 1948, late in the month of June
Your parents smile for the camera
In the sienna shades of light
Now you're older than they were
Then that summer night

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand
It's a need you never get used to
So fierce and so confused
It's a loss you never get over
The first time you lose

And tonight I am thinking of someone
Seventeen years ago
We rode in his daddy's car
Down the river road

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand
Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understandEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's OK to be sad
It's alright to be lonely
You won't always feel bad
Somebody told me
These feelings like weather, they come and they go
Today I felt better, tomorrow who knows

Could there be healing instead
Instead of breaking, I'm hoping
That the cracks beginning to spread
Is me breaking open
And if I let everything in
The shadows as well as the light
How else could I know I'm alright?
How else would I know?

It's OK to be tired
Fuck all the excuses
Whatever's required
There's no day that's useless
What's hollow and empty
What's lost and undone
What can and what can't be
Is how you become
Could there be beauty instead
Instead of breaking your hope and
That the cracks beginning to spread
Is the way you break open
And if you let everything in
The shadows as well as the light
How else could you know you're alright?
How else would you know?


Could there be healing instead
Instead of breaking, we're hoping
That the cracks beginning to spread
Is the way we break open
Could there be loving instead
Instead of breaking, we're hoping
That the cracks beginning to spread
Is the way we break open
And when we let everything in
The shadows as well as the light
That's how we know we're alright
That's how we knowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When we were young, we pledged allegiance
Every morning of our lives
The classroom rang with children's voices
Under teacher's watchful eye
We learned about the world around us
At our desks and at dinnertime
Reminded of the starving children
We cleaned our plates with guilty minds

And the stones in the road
Shone like diamonds in the dust
And then a voice called to us
To make our way back home

When I was ten, my father held me
On his shoulders above the crowd
To see a train draped in mourning
Pass slowly through our town
His widow kneeled with all their children
At the sacred burial ground
And the TV glowed that long hot summer
With all the cities burning down
And the stones in the road
Flew out beneath our bicycle tires
Worlds removed from all those fires
As we raced each other home

And now we drink our coffee on the run
We climb that ladder rung by rung
We are the daughters and the sons
And here's the line that's missing

The starving children have been replaced
By souls out on the street
We give a dollar when we pass
And hope our eyes don't meet
We pencil in, we cancel out
We crave the corner suite
We kiss your ass, we make you hold
We doctor the receipt

And the stones in the road
They fly out from beneath our wheels
Another day, another deal
Before we get back home
Stones in the road
Leave a mark from whence they came
A thousand points of light or shame
Baby, I don't knowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Grow old along with me
The best is yet to be
When our time has come
We will be as one

Grow old along with me
Two branches of one tree
Face the setting sun
When the day is done
God bless our love
God bless our love

Spending our lives together
Man and wife together
World without end
World without end

Grow old along with me
Whatever fate decrees
We will see it through
For our love is true
God bless our love
God bless our loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Try to conjure up a night
Of jessamine upon the air
I'm seventeen and in a car
Ready to ride anywhere
This summer night sticks to my skin
And the beer's gone to my head
My arm hangs out the window
And I can't hear what you just said

Over the radio
Wild, wild horses
Everything you'll ever know
Is in the choruses

Everything that made you whole
Everything that broke your heart
Whatever called you by your soul
And piece by piece took you apart
Every spark you ever chased
All the faith love robbed you of
Every light the dark erased
Every cause that gave you up
Turn on the radio
Wild, wild horses
Everywhere we'd ever go
Is in the choruses

Standing on the porch tonight
All I hear is a distant car
Watching the fading light
Between the dirt and the stars
Between the rough and smooth
And the easy and the hard
The lonely sound of loneliness
That's shaped just like my heart

Years will pass before we turn
To face the place where we come from
Years will pass before we learn
What time denies to everyone
If we're lucky ghosts and prayers
Are company, not enemies
I time travel straight back there
When you were singing back to me
Along with the radio
Wild, wild horses
Everything we'll ever know
Is in the choruses
Over the radio
Wild, wild horses
Everywhere we'll ever go
Is in the chorusesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In this world there's a whole lot of trouble baby
In this world there's a whole lot of pain
In this world there's a whole lot of trouble but
A whole lot of ground to gain
Why take when you could be giving?
Why watch as the world goes by?
It's a hard enough life to be living
Why walk when you can fly?

In this world there's a whole lot of sorrow
In this world there's a whole lot of shame
In this world there's a whole lot of sorrow
And a whole lot of ground to gain
When you spend your whole life wishing
Wanting and wondering why
It's a long enough life to be living
Why walk when you can fly?

And in this world there's a whole lot of golden
In this world there's a whole lot of plain
In this world you've a soul for a compass
And a heart for a pair of wings
There's a star on the far horizon
Rising bright in an azure sky
For the rest of the time that you're given
Why walk when you can fly high?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I haven't a reason, a clue or a sign
I haven't the slightest idea
Of the shape of your heart or the state of your mind
Do you ever let anyone near
Do you ever reach out with arms open wide
Do you ever jump in closing your eyes
Or are you one of the fortunate kind
Alone but not lonely

Everyday on the street I study their faces
The ones who rush on through the crowd
Towards their own quiet worlds, their separate places
Somewhere I'm never allowed
'Cause I've always been one to say what I need
And than the next thing it's done and I'm watching 'em leave
And I'm thinking, I wish I could be
Alone but not lonely

So which one are you tonight
Do you change with the morning light
Do you say more than what sounds right
Do you say what you mean?
So which one are you tonight
Do you change with the morning light
Do you say more than what sounds right
Do you say what you mean?

There are moments in time that are meant to be held
Like fragile, breakable things
There are others that pass us, you can't even tell
Such is their grace and their speed
And this one is gone in the blink of an eye
You can ask me the truth but tonight I will lie
Unflinching I'll tell you that I'm alone but not lonelyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I took a walk in the rain one day
On the wrong side of the tracks
I stood on the rails till I saw that train
Just to see how my heart would react
Now some people say that you shouldn't tempt fate
And for them I cannot disagree
But I never learned nothing from playing it safe
I say fate should not tempt me

I take my chances
I don't mind working without a net
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get

I sat alone in the dark one night
Tuning in by remote
I found a preacher who spoke of the light
But there was brimstone in his throat
He'd show me the way according to him
In return for my personal check
I flipped my channel back to CNN
And I lit another cigarette
I take my chances
Yes, forgiveness doesn't come with a debt
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get

I've crossed lines with words and wire
And both have cut me deep
I've been frozen out and I've been on fire
And the tears are mine to weep
But I can cry until I laugh
Or laugh until I cry
So cut the deck right in half
I'll play from either side

I take my chances
I pay my dollar and I place my bet
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get

I take my chances
Yeah, I don't cling to remorse or regret
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get
I'll take my chances
I'll take my chancesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

As long as you and I are standing in a photograph in a frame
As long as there's a vine of summer squash and peach pie on a sill
As long as there's still time and room to chase it, try and hold it still

An old hat in the hallway
The way the light turns gold
Twilight on a fall day
And the sound of your old D-35

As long you appear in my dreams to show me how it was
As long as I am here to shake a fist at the universe above

A shot glass filled with whiskey
A screen door that won't close
Loneliness and mystery
And the sound of your old D-35

We find the one we're meant for if we're truly meant to be
As if fate's in charge and all we have to do is call on destiny
As long as there are songs that sound like rain on an old terne roof
As long as we belong to another time before we knew how much we'd lose
As long as there's a sky turning into darkness after day

A cigarette's ash glowing
An endless stretch of road
Everything worth knowing

Saying "welcome, welcome, share this feast
Come in away from sorrow."

Oh, yeah-yeah

He was a small-town southern boy, born and bred
Credit to his hard-working mother and dad
Clutch of diplomas and a uniform
Served his country then he shipped back home
Hung out his shingle, but it didn't take
He had real big dreams that he could not shake
Left that town with his hand on his heart
Ready for his oath and his life to start

Ah, he just can't lose
He's all over the news
Battin' sweet baby blues
It's the American way
To hell with the truth
He's suckin' up to the dude
He's an American stooge
And maybe he likes it that way

Once he stood at a fork in the road
Scratchin' his head which way to go
Power on his left, conscience on his right
A soul in the balance in a knockdown fight
When he's not kissin' the ring and levelin' threats
He's proud to be your favorite hypocrite
Polishin' sound bites for the folks at home
A moth to a flame and a microphone

Show a little inspiration, show a little spark
Show that things that drew me to you an' stole my heart
And tell me something I don't know instead of everything I do
And look at me as if I mean something to you

Our hearts are beating while we sleep
But while we're wide awake

You know the world won't stop
And actions speak louder
Listen to your heart
And what your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard way

Show a little passion, baby, show a little style
And show the knack for knowing when
And the gift for knowing how
And have a little trust in us
When fear obscures the path
You know we got this far, darling
Not by luck, but by never turnin' back
Some will call on destiny
But I just call on faith

That the world won't stop
And actions speak louder
Listen to your heart
To what your heart might say
Everything you got, you got the hard way

Caught up in our little lives
There's not a lot left over
I see what's missing in your eyes
You're searching for that field of clover

So show a little inspiration, show a little spark
Show the world a little light when you show it your heart
We've got two lives, one we're given
And the other one we make

And the world won't stop
And actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, and your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard
Everything we got, we got the hard way
Everything we got, we got the hard way
Because the world won't stop
