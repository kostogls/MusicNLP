Everything is free now
That's what they say
Everything I ever done
Gonna give it away
Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That we're gonna do it anyway
Even if it doesn't pay

I can get a tip jar
Gas up the car
And try to make a little change
Down at the bar
Or I can get a straight job
I done it before
Never minded working hard
It's who I'm working for

And everything is free now
That's what they say
Everything I ever done
Gotta give it away
Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That we're gonna do it anyway
Even if it doesn't pay

Every day I wake up
Hummin' a song
But I don't need to run around
I'll just stay at home
And sing a little love song
My love and myself
If there's something that you wanna hear
You can sing it yourself

'Cause everything is free now
That's what I said
No one's gotta listen to
The words in my head
Someone hit the big score
And I figured it out
And I'm gonna do it anyway
Even if it doesn't payEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh me oh my oh look at Miss Ohio
She’s a-running around with her ragtop down
She says "I wanna do right, but not right now"
Gonna drive to Atlanta and live out this fantasy
Running around with the ragtop down
Yeah, I wanna do right, but not right now
Had your arm around her shoulder of a regimental soldier
And mamma starts pushing that wedding gown
Yeah, you wanna do right, but not right now
Oh me oh my oh, would you look at Miss Ohio?
She’s a-running around with the ragtop down
She says "I wanna do right, but not right now"
I know all about it, so you don’t have to shout it
I’m gonna straighten it out somehow
Yeah, I wanna do right, but not right now
Oh me oh my oh, look at Miss Ohio
She a-running around with her ragtop down
She says "I wanna do right, but not right now"
Oh, I want do right, but not right nowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Darling remember, when you come to me
I'm the pretender; I'm not what I'm supposed to be
But who could know if I'm a traitor?
Time's the revelator

They caught the Katy, and left me a mule to ride
The fortune lady came along, she walked beside
But every word seemed to date her
Time's the revelator, the revelator


Up in the morning, up and on the line
Drive into Corning, and all the spindles whine
And every day is getting straighter
Time's the revelator, the revelator


Leaving the valley, and fucking out of sight
I'll go back to Cali where I can sleep out every night
And watch the waves and move the fader
Time's the revelator, the revelator
Queen of fakes and imitators
Time's the revelatorEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There was a Camptown man, used to plow and sing
He loved that mule and the mule loved him
When the day got long, as it does about now
I'd hear him singing to his muley cow
Calling, "Come on my sweet old girl
I'd bet the whole damn world
That we're gonna make it yet to the end of the row"
Singing "Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, Bessie
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind no more"
Said it's a mean old world, heavy in need
That big machine is just a-picking up speed
And we're supping on tears, and we're supping on wine
We all get to heaven in our own sweet time
So come all you Asheville boys
Turn up your old-time noise
And kick 'til the dust comes up from the cracks in the floor
Singing, "Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, Brother
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind no more"
But the Camptown man, he doesn't plow no more
I seen him walking down to the cigarette store
Guess he lost that knack and he forgot that song
Woke up one morning and the mule was gone
So come all ye ragtime kings
And come on, you dogs, and sing
And pick up your dusty old horn and give it a blow
Playing, "Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, Honey
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, Sugar
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind no more"EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died

Just a country boy that combed his hair
And put on a shirt his mother made and went on the air
And he shook it like a chorus girl
And he shook it like a Harlem queen
And he shook it like a midnight rambler, baby
Like you never seen
Never seen

I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died

'Cause he took it all out of black and white
Grabbed his wand in the other hand and he held on tight
And he shook it like a hurricane
And he shook it like to make it break
And he shook it like a holy roller, baby
With his soul at stake
Soul at stake
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died

He was all alone in a long decline
Thinking how happy John Henry was that he fell down and died
When he shook it and he rang like silver
And he shook it and it shined like gold
And he shook it and he beat that steam drill, baby
Well bless my soul
Well bless my soul

And he shook it and he beat that steam drill, baby
Well bless my soul, what's wrong with me?

I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died

Go to sleep you little babe
Go to sleep you little babe
Your mama's gone away and your daddy's gonna stay
Didn't leave nobody but the baby
Go to sleep you little babe

Everybody's gone in the cotton and the corn
Didn't leave nobody but the baby
You're sweet little babe

Honey in the rock and the sugar don't stop
Gonna' bring a bottle to the baby
Don't you weep pretty babe
Don't you weep pretty babe
She's long gone with her red shoes on
Gonna' need another lovin' baby
Go to sleep you little babe
Go to sleep you little babe

Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come and rest my soul
I dream a highway back to you

John, he's kicking out the footlights
The Grand Ole Opry's got a brand new band
Lord, let me die with a hammer in my hand
I dream a highway back to you

I think I'll move down into Memphis
And thank the hatchet man who forked my tongue
I lie and wait until the wagons come
And dream a highway back to you

The getaway kicking up cinders
An empty wagon full of rattling bones
Moon in the mirror on a three-hour jones
I dream a highway back to you

Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come arrest my soul
N'I dream a highway back to you
Which lover are you, Jack of Diamonds?
Now you be Emmylou and I'll be Gram
I send a letter, don't know who I am
I dream a highway back to you

I'm an indisguisable shade of twilight
Any second now I'm gonna turn myself on
In the blue display of the cool cathode ray
I dream a highway back to you

I wish you knew me, Jack of Diamonds
Fire-riding, wheeling when I laid 'em up
Drank whisky with my water, sugar with my tea
My sails in rags with the staggers and the jags
I dream a highway back to you

Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come molest my soul
N'I dream a highway back to you

Now give me some of what you're having
I'll take you as a viper into my head
A knife into my bed, arsenic when I'm fed
N'I dream a highway back to you
Hang overhead from all directions
Radiation from the porcelain light
Blind and blistered by the morning white
I dream a highway back to you

Sunday morning at the diner
Hollywood trembles on the verge of tears
I watched the waitress for a thousand years
Saw a wheel inside a wheel, heard a call within a call
N'I dreamed a highway back to you

Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision convalesced my soul
N'I dream a highway back to you

Step into the light, poor Lazarus
Don't lie alone behind the window shade
Let me see the mark death made
And I dream a highway back to you
I dream a highway back to you
What will sustain us through the winter?
Where did last years lessons go?
Walk me out into the rain and snow
I dream a highway back to you

Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come and bless my soul
N'I dream a highway back to you
I dream a highway back to you

Oh I dream a highway back to you, love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come and bless my soul
I dream a highway back to youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Standing on the corner with a nickel or a dime
There used to be a rail car to take you down the line
Too much beer and whiskey to ever be employed
And when I got to Nashville, it was too much soldier's joy
Wasted on the wayside, wasted on the way
If I don't go tomorrow, you know I'm gone today
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Black highway all-night ride
Watching the times fall away to the side
Clear channel way down low
Is coming in loud and my mind let go
Peaches in the summertime, apples in the fall
If I can't have you all the time, I won't have none at all
Oh, I wish I was in 'Frisco in a brand new pair of shoes
I'm sitting here in Nashville with Norman's Nashville blues
So come all you good time rounders listening to my sound
And then drink a round to Nashville before they tear it down
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Hard weather, driving slow
The buggies and the hats in town for the show
Oh darling, the songs they played
Are all I got left of the love we made
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Buddy I went down to Scarlet Town
Ain't never been there before
Well, you slept on a feather bed
I slept on the floor
Now I don't mind a lean old time
Or drinking my coffee cold
But the things I seen in Scarlet Town
Did mortify my soul
Well, look at that deep well
Look at that dark grave
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today
Now I spent some time in New Orleans
And in Cairo on a bend
But Scarlet Town brought me down
Low as I ever been
Ahh, look at that deep well
Look at that dark grave
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today
On the day I came to Scarlet Town
You promised I'd be your bride
You left me here to rot away
Like Polly on the mountainside
Ahh, look at that deep well
Look at that dark grave
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today
Now you may hide in Scarlet Town
For a hundred years or more
But the man who knows what time it is
Is knocking at the door
So fare you well, my own true love
If you ever see me around
I'll be looking through a telescope
From hell to Scarlet Town
Now, look at that deep well
Look at that dark grave
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town todayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Beyond the earth and sky
Lie-d Lie-d Lie

And there the work of my own hand
Be broken by and by

Sometimes it finds me fast asleep
And wakes me where I lie
Lie-d Lie-d Lie

Forget my sins upon the wind
My hobo soul will rise

There were two sisters of county Clair
Oh, the wind and rain
One was dark and the other was fair
Oh, the dreadful wind and rain
And they both had a love of the miller's son
Oh, the wind and rain
But he was fond of the fairer one
Oh, the dreadful wind and rain
So she pushed her into the river to drown
Oh, the wind and rain
And watched her as she floated down
Oh, the dreadful wind and rain
And she floated till she came to the millers pond
Oh, the wind and the rain
Dead on the water like a golden swan
Oh, the dreadful wind and rain
As she came to rest on the riverside
Oh, the wind and the rain
And her bones were washed by the rolling tide
Oh, the dreadful wind and rain
And along the road came a fiddler fair
Oh, the wind and rain
And found her bones just a lying there, cried
Oh, the dreadful wind and rain
So he made a fiddle peg of her long finger bone
Oh, the wind and the rain
He a made a fiddle peg of her long finger bone, crying
Oh, the dreadful wind and rain
And he strung his fiddle bow with her long yeller hair
Oh, the wind and the rain
He strung his fiddle bow with her long yeller hair, cried
Oh, the dreadful wind and rain
And he made a fiddle fiddle of her breast bone
Oh, the wind and rain
He made a fiddle fiddle of her breast bone, cried
Oh, the dreadful wind and rain
But the only tune that the fiddle could play was

Look out boys, I'm a rollin' stone
That's what I was when I first left home
I took every secret that I'd ever known
And headed for the wall
Like a wrecking ball
Started down on that road to sin
Playin' bass under a pseudonym
The days were rough and it's all quite dim
But my mind cuts through it all
Like a wrecking ball
Oh just a little Deadhead
Who is watching, who is watching?
I was just a little Deadhead
A fallen daughter on a scholarship
I got tired and let my average slip
Then I was a farmer in the pogonip
Where the weed that I recall
Was like a wrecking ball
I met a lovesick daughter of the San Joaquin
She showed me colors I'd never seen
Drank the bottom out of my canteen
Then left me in the fall
Like a wrecking ball
Standin' there in the morning mist
Tug the coat at the end of my wrist
Yes, I remember when first we kissed
Though it was nothing at all
Like a wrecking ball
Hey boys, a little Deadhead
Who is watching, who is watching?
I was just a little Deadhead
With too much trouble for me to shake
Oh, the weather and the blinding ache
Was riding high until the '89 quake
Hit the Santa Cruz Garden Mall
Like a wrecking ballEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Caleb Meyer, he lived alone
In them hollarin' pines
And he made a little whiskey for himself
Said it helped to pass the time

Long one evening in back of my house
Caleb come around
And he called my name 'til I came out
With no one else around

Caleb Meyer, your ghost is gonna
Wear them rattlin' chains
But when I go to sleep at night
Don't you call my name

Where's your husband, Nellie Kane
Where's your darling gone?
Did he go on down the mountain side
And leave you all alone?

Yes, my husband's gone to Bowlin' Green
To do some business there
Then Caleb threw that bottle down
And grabbed me by my hair
Caleb Meyer, your ghost is gonna
Wear them rattlin' chains
But when I go to sleep at night
Don't you call my name

He threw me in a needle bed
Across my dress he lay
Then he pinned my hands above my head
And I commenced to pray

I cried My God, I am your child
Send your angels down
Then feelin' with my fingertips
The bottle neck I found

I drew that glass across his neck
As fine as any blade
Then I felt his blood pour fast and hot
'Round me where I lay

Caleb Meyer, your ghost is gonna
Wear them rattlin' chains
But when I go to sleep at night
Don't you call my name

Wear them rattlin' chains

Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet soft and low
When I'm broke and I got nowhere to go
Been hanging 'round with a good-time friends of mine
Hanging around with a good-time friends of mine
Oh, they treat me very nice and kind
When I've got a dollar and a dime
We're in blues everywhere I see
We're in blues everywhere I see
We're in blues, honey, everywhere I see
No one ever had the blues like me
Way I'm sleeping, my back and shoulders tired
Way I'm sleeping, my back and shoulders tired
Come tomorrow, I'll be satisfied

I lease twenty acres and one Jenny mule
From the Alabama trust
Half of the cotton, a third of the corn
Ya get a handful of dust

And we cannot have all things to please us
No matter how we try
Until we've all gone to Jesus
We can only wonder why

I had a daughter, called her Annabelle
She's the apple of my eye
Tried to give her something like I never had
I didn't want to ever hear her cry

And we cannot have all things to please us
No matter how we try
Until we've all gone to Jesus
We can only wonder why

When I'm dead and buried I'll take a hard life of tears
For every day I've ever known
Anna's in the churchyard, she's got no life at all
She's only got these words on a stone
And we cannot have all things to please us
No matter how we try
Until we've all gone to Jesus
We can only wonder why

Becky Johnson bought the farm
Put a needle in her arm

That's the way
And her brother laid her down
In the cold Kentucky ground
That's the way that it goes

That's the way that it ends
Though there was a time when she and I were friends

Took her cat and left LA

She was busted, broke and flat
Had to sell that pussycat

A long time ago I left my home
For a job in the fruit trees
But I missed those hills with the windy pines
For their song seemed to suit me
So I sent my wages to my home
Said we'd soon be together
For the next good crop would pay my way
And I would come home forever
One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills, boys, I'll never roam
One more dollar and I'm going home
No work said the boss at the bunk house door
There's a freeze on the branches
So when the dice came out at the bar downtown
I rolled and I took my chances
One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills, boys, I'll never roam
One more dollar and I'm going home
A long time ago I left my home
Just a boy passing twenty
Could you spare a coin and a Christian prayer?
For my luck has turned against me
One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills, boys, I'll never roam
One more dollar and I'm going home
One more dollar
Boys I'm going homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When the iceberg hit,
Oh they must of known
God moves on the water
Like Casey Jones.
So I walked downtown
On my telephone
And took a lazy turn
Through the red-eye zone
It was a five band bill
A two dollar show
I saw the van out front
From Idaho
And a girl passed out
In the backseat trash
There was no way they'd make
Even a half a tank of gas.
They looked sick and stoned
And strangely dressed
No one showed
From the local press
But I watched them walk
Through the bottom land
And I wished I played
In a rock and roll band
Hey, hey
It was the 14th day of April
Well they closed it down
With the sails in rags
And they swept up the fags
And the local rags
Threw the plastic cups
Into plastic bags
And the cooks cleaned the kitchen
With the staggers and the jags.
Ruination day
And the sky was red
I went back to work
And back to bed
And the iceberg broke
And the Okies fled
And the Great Emancipator
Took a bullet in the back of the head2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I lost you awhile ago
Still I don't know why
I can't say your name
Without a crow flying by
Gotta watch my back now
That you turned me around
Got me walking backwards
Into my hometown
Throw me a rope
On the rolling tide
What did you want me to be?
You said it's him or me
The way you made it
That's the way it will be
We were seven years on the Burma shore
With Gatling guns and paint
Working the lowlands door-to-door
Like a Latter-Day Saint
Then you turned me out
At the top of the stair
And you took all the glory
That you just couldn't share
I've never been so disabused
I've never been so mad
I've never been served anything
That tasted so bad
You might need a friend
Any day now, any day
Oh my brother, be careful
You are drifting away
Throw me a rope
On the rolling tide
What did you want me to be?
You said it's him or me
The way you made it

I am an orphan on God's highway
But I'll share my troubles if you go my way
I have no mother, no father
No sister, no brother
I am an orphan girl
I have had friendships, pure and golden
But the ties of kinship, I have not known them
I know no mother, no father
No sister, no brother
I am an orphan girl
But when He calls me I will be able
To meet my family at God's table
I'll meet my mother, my father
My sister, my brother
No more orphan girl
Blessed Savior, make me willing
And walk beside me until I'm with them
Be my mother, my father
My sister, my brother
I am an orphan girlEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
