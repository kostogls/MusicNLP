On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
So, if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice"

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right"

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep
And when he finished speakin'
He turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em)
Know when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em)
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow
Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
"Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun"

Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky, n'there was three of them
Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace, took down his daddy's picture
As a tear fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again
Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him
When he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him half way cross the floor
Tommy turned around they said, "Hey look, old yella's leavin'"
But you could've heard a pin drop
When Tommy stopped and locked the door
Twenty years of crawling was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holding nothing back, he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing
He said, "This one's for Becky" as he watched the last one fall
N' I heard him say

I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And Papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man
Everyone considered him the coward of the county3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Lady, I'm your knight in shining armor
And I love you
You have made me what I am and I am yours
My love, there's so many ways
I want to say I love you
Let me hold you in my arms forever more

You have gone and made me such a fool
I'm so lost in your love
And oh, we belong together
Won't you believe in my song

Lady, for so many years
I thought I'd never find you
You have come into my life
And made me whole
Forever let me wake to see you each and every morning
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear

In my eyes I see no one else but you
There's no other love like our love
And yes, oh yes
I'll always want you near me
I've waited for you for so long
Lady, your love's the only love I need
And beside me is where I want you to be
'Cause my love
There's something I want you to know
You're the love of my life
You're my lady3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I can't remember when you weren't there
When I didn't care for anyone but you
I swear we've been through everything there is
Can't imagine anything we've missed
Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do

Through the years, you've never let me down
You turned my life around, the sweetest days I've found
I've found with you... through the years
I've never been afraid, I've loved the life we've made
And I'm so glad I've stayed, right here with you
Through the years

I can't remember what I used to do
Who I trusted, whom I listened to before
I swear you've taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more
Through the years, through all the good and bad
I knew how much we had, I've always been so glad
To be with you ... through the years
It's better every day, you've kissed my tears away
As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you
Through the years
Through the years, when everything went wrong
Together we were strong, I know that I belonged
Right here with you... through the years
I never had a doubt, we'd always work things out
I've learned what love's about, by loving you
Through the years
Through the years, you've never let me down
You've turned my life around, the sweetest days I've found
I've found with you ... through the years
It's better every day, you've kissed my tears away
As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you
Through the years!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In a bar in Toledo
Across from the depot
On a bar stool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer
So I walked on over
I sat down and asked her name
When the drinks finally hit her
She said I'm no quitter
But I finally quit living on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter
And here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings
In the mirror I saw him
And I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman
Who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused
He looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking
His big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille

After he left us
I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the bar room
To a rented hotel room
We walked without talkin' at all
She was a beauty
But when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her
'Cuz the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time

You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in)
I woke up this mornin' with the sundown shinin' in
I found my mind in a brown paper bag within
I tripped on a cloud and fell-a eight miles high
I tore my mind on a jagged sky
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
(Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in)
I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then I followed it in
I watched myself crawlin' out as I was a-crawlin' in
I got up so tight I couldn't unwind
I saw so much I broke my mind
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
(Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in)
Someone painted "April Fool" in big black letters on a "Dead End" sign
I had my foot on the gas as I left the road and blew out my mind
Eight miles outta Memphis and I got no spare
Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
I said I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
Yeah yeah oh-yeah3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I can find a way, find a way

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through
God her love is true

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I can find a way, while she waits while she waits for meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

And he'll tell her he's working late again
But she knows too well there's something going on
She's been neglected, and she needs a friend
So her trembling fingers dial the telephone

Lord, it hurts her doing this again
He's the best friend that her husband ever knew
When she's lonely, he's more than just a friend
He's the one she longs to give her body to

Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
They don't want to hurt the others
So they love in the nighttime
And shake hands in the light of day

When it's over, there's no peace of mind
Just a longing for the way things should have been
And she wonders why some men never find
That a woman needs a lover and a friend
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
They don't want to hurt the others
So they love in the nighttime
And shake hands in the light of day

Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
They don't want to hurt the others
So they love in the nighttime
And shake hands in the light of day
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
They don't want to hurt the others
So they love in the nighttime
And shake hands in the light of dayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I know it's late
I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are
Both of us lonely
Longing for shelter from all that we see
Why should we worry?
No one will care, girl
Look at the stars now, so far away
We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight, babe, why don't you stay?
Deep in my soul
I feel so lonely
All of my hopes fading away
I've longed for love
Like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searching after today
So there it is, girl
We've got it all now
And here we are, babe
What do you say?
We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight, babe, why don't we stay?
I know it's late and I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are
Both of us lonely, both of us lonely
We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
Let's make it last
Let's find a way
Turn out the light, come take my hand now
We've got tonight, babe, why don't we stay?
We've got tonight, babe, why don't we stay?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

All my life was a paper once plain, pure and white
Till you moved with your pen changing moods now and then
Till the balance was right
Then you added some music, every note was in place
And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face
And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart
You decorated my life
Like a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song
There was no harmony life meant nothin' to me, until you came along
And you brought out the colors, what a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see all the things life can be shining soft in your eyes
And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart
You decorated my lifeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I wanted for life, you and me in the wind
I never thought there'd come a time that our story would end
It's hard to understand but I guess I'll have to try
It's not easy to say goodbye

For all the joy we share, all that time we had to spend
Now if I had one wish I'd want forever back again
To look into your eyes and hold you when you cry
It's not easy to say goodbye

I remember all those great time we had
So many memories, some good, some bad
Yes and through it all those memories will last forever

There's peace in where you are maybe all I need to know
And if I listen to my heart I'll hear your laughter once more
And so I have to say I'm just glad you came my way
It's not easy to say goodbye

GoodbyeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby, are you contemplating going out somewhere?
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is goin' down

Oh, Ruby
Don't take your love to town

It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true, that I'm not the man I used to be

Oh, Ruby
I still need some company

It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and the needs of a woman of your age
Ruby, I realize
But it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around

Oh, Ruby
Don't take your love to town
She's leavin' now 'cause I just heard the slammin' of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam 100 times before
And if I could move, I'd get my gun and put her in the ground

Oh, Ruby
Don't take your love to town

You are the reason for me, you help me understand
I'll be your shelter from the rain that never ends
Girl, you've always got a friend in me
All the love we had
I should've known our love was older than the past
Throwing my life away on songs I never heard
Just the speaking of a special word
I made you die inside but you loved me
And don't believe the world
No, the world can't give us paradise
When you make your love to me
Til I just could not see the light
As long as I got you
As long as I got me
As long as we got you and I
I won't let you down
No better love will be there when you turn around
I'll be living for you till the ocean turns to sand
There will never be any man
Could love you just the way that I love you....
So don't believe the world
No the world can't give us paradise
In the eye within the storm
When I just could not make it through the night
As long as I got you
As long as I got me
As long as we got you and I
So don't believe the world

Just look at you sitting there
You never looked better than tonight
And it would be so easy to tell you I'd stay
Like I've done so many times

I was so sure that this would be the night
You'd close the door and wanna stay with me
And it'd be so easy to tell you I'd wait
Like I've done so many times

Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll always take you in
Just when you think you've really changed him
He'll leave you again
Don't you fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll break you every time
Put out the light and just hold on
Before we say goodbye

Now it's morning, the phone rings
And you say you've gotta get your things together
You just gotta leave before you change your mind
And if you knew what I was thinking girl
I'd turn around if you'd just ask me one more time
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll always take you in
Just when you think you've really changed him
He'll leave you again
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll break you every time
Put out the light and just hold on
Before we say goodbye
Before we said goodbye

Little boy in a baseball hat
Stands in the feild with his ball and bat
Says, I am the greatest player of them all
Put his bat on his shoulder and he tosses up the ball

And the ball goes up and the ball comes down
Swings his bat all the way around
The worlds so still he can hear the sound
The baseball falls to the ground

Now the little boy doesn't say a word
Picks up his ball, he is undeterred
Says, I am the greatest there has ever been
And he grits his teeth and he tries it again

And the ball goes up and the ball comes down
Swings his bat all the way around
The worlds so still he can hear the sound
The baseball falls to the ground

He makes no excuses
He shows no fear
He just closes his eyes
And listens to the cheers
Little boy, he adjusts his hat
Picks up his ball, stares at his bat
Says, I am the greatest, the game is on the line
And he gives his all one last time

And the ball goes up when the moons so bright
Swings his bat with all his might
And the worlds so still as still can be
And the baseball falls and thats strike three

Now it's suppertime and his mama calls
Little boy starts home with his bat and ball
Says, I am the greatest that is a fact
But even I didn't know I could pitch like that!

Says, I am the greatest
That is understood
But even I didn't know
I could pitch that good....EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Girl, there are no words to say
What I feel in my heart
You, you're on my mind night and day
And it hurts me when we're apart
When you're not here by my side
There is nothing in this world for me
I guess I'm crazy, crazy for you can't you see
And although you may think it's crazy
Here is where I'll want to be
I will always need your love
Well now, I can see every dream
When I look in your eyes
And though, things never are what they seem
There is one thing that I realize
That there's no doubt in my mind
We can make this love go on forever
I guess I'm crazy, crazy for you can't you see
And although you may think I'm crazy
Here is where I'll always be
And I need you with me

And I will wear it like a shining star
Write your name across my heart
To you my life is an open door
Everything I have is yours
I'll try to give you everything you need
But as far as love goes, there's a life-time guarantee
Write your name across my heart
I want the world to know that I am yours forever
And I will wear it like a shining star
Write your name across my heart
In all my thoughts, in all I do, in all I say
I belong to you with every breath I take....

Show me that you need me
Like the river needs the early morning rain
Show me that you want me
Cause I really need to feel your heart again
Tell me that you love me
If it was the middle of a moonless night
Would you shine for me baby?
Would you hold me tight?
If a flame was fadin' from a lost desire
Would you put another log on the fire?
Baby, like a candle burnin' down
Maybe we could turn this thing around
Kiss me like you mean it
Like you wouldn't have it any other way
Let nothing stand between us
Honey let's don't ever let it fade away
Tell me that you love me
Do you love me?
We could camp out on Old Hickory Lake
Talking all night and sleepin' in late
Looking at the stars like we used to do
Honey you don't know how I've missed you
Save me, for so long I've been longing for you baby
It's all up to you
Show me that you need me

Show me that you want me

Dawn is slowly breaking
Our friends have all gone home
You and I are waiting
For Santa Clause to come
There's a present by the tree
Stockings on the wall
And knowing you're in love with me
Is the greatest gift of all
The fire is slowly fading
Chill is in the air
All the gifts are waiting
For children everywhere
Throught the window I can see
Snow begin to fall
Knowing you're in love with me
Is the greatest gift of all
Just before I go to sleep
I hear a church bell ring
Merry Christmas everyone
Is the song it sings
So I say a silent prayer
For creatures great and small
Peace on Earth, good will to men
Is the greatest gift of all
Peace on Earth, good will to men
Is the greatest gift of allEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
