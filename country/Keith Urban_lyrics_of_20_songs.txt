I can...
See you over there starin' at your drink
Watchin' that ice sink, all alone tonight
And...
Chances are you're sittin' here in this bar
'Cause he ain't gonna treat you right
Well, it's...
Probably not my place but I'm gonna say it anyway
‘Cause you look like
You...
Haven’t felt the fire, had a little fun
Hadn’t had a smile in a little while, baby

Blue...
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
But darlin', it don’t match your eyes
I’m tellin’ you...
You don’t need that guy
It’s so black and white, he’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color

I'm not tryna...
Be another just pick you up kinda guy
Tryna drink you up, tryna take you home
But I just...
I don't understand how another man
Can take your sun and turn it ice cold
Well, I've...
Had enough to drink and it's makin' me think
That I just might
Tell you...
If I were a painter I wouldn’t change ya
I’d just paint you bright, baby
'Cause blue...
Looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
But darlin', it don’t match your eyes
I’m tellin’ you...
You don’t need that guy
It’s so black and white, he’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color

No, no, no

Looks good on the sky

When you hear somebody say somebody hits like a girl
How does that hit you?
Is that such a bad thing?
When you hear a song that they play sayin' you run the world
Do you believe it?
Will you live to see it?

When somebody laughs and implies that she asked for it
Just cause she was wearing a skirt
Oh, is that how that works?
When somebody talks about how it was Adam first
Does that make you second best?
Or did he save the best for last?

I'm a 45 spinning on an old Victrola
I'm a two-strike swinger, I'm a Pepsi Cola
I'm a blue jean quarterback saying "I love you" to the prom queen
In a Chevy
I'm John Wayne, Superman, California
I'm a Kris Kristofferson, Sunday morning
I'm a mama and daddy singing along to Don McLean
At the levee

And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16

Hey, hey
Everything I needed
That's right

I'm Mark Twain on the Mississippi
I'm Hemingway with a shot of whiskey
I'm a TV dinner on a tray trying to figure out the Wheel of Fortune
I'm a Texaco star, I'm a Gibson guitar
I'm still a teenage kid trying to go too far
I'm a jukebox waiting in a neon bar for a quarter
And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16

I spent a lot of years running from believing
Looking for another way to save my soul
The longer I live, the more I see it
There's only one way home

And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16
Oh, I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old (never grow old)
Another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16

You said "I love you" to me
And I don't know what that means
So I froze on my feet
People use it so carelessly
And I couldn’t believe
That you would dive in so deep
And you said perfectly
Everything I’ve been feelin' about you
It’s time to break the chains that held me back from you

So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line

Well I was never the type
To put it all on the line
But I've been changing my mind since you opened my eyes
It was the way that the light
Picked you out of that night
Then you were right by my side
Put a soul in my body
And now it’s time to close the space between the two of us
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line

Oh, baby it's time
Oh, it's time

Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
And take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it

I hit the highway and I checked the time
I see the sunrise and it makes me wanna change my mind
Oh I got it bad
I stopped for coffee in a no where town
A pretty waitress says, hey what's the frown
Boy you've got it bad
Well so many times you told me before
If I don't like it, well there's the door
This time I've gone for good and I got it bad

I got it badder than a broken heart
Badder than the Devil's smile
And I can't face bein' apart
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile
Oohh I got it bad

Moonlight on the water still looks the same
Pretty girl beside me but I don't know her name
Guess I got it bad
I'm too weak to say no, too lonely to care
I'll believe her if she says hey baby
I got love to spare
Well tomorrow I'll take it like a man
Tonight I'm takin' all I can
This time I went for good and I got it bad
I got it badder than a broken heart
Badder than the Devil's smile
And I can't face bein' apart

There'll be days your heart don't wanna beat
You pray more than you breathe
And you just wanna fall to pieces
And nights, those 2 AM calls
Where dreams become walls
And you just need a break
Break on me

Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me

There'll be times when someone you know
Becomes someone you knew
But you'd do anything to change it
And words you wanna take back
But you know you can't
When the page just won't turn
And it still hurts
Break on me
Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me

When you need somebody right now
You're where I'll be

Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me

If somethin' ain’t right, I will let you know
Like the paint that's drying on a heart that's broke
Let me carry your burden

I’ll get you back on a high when you're feeling low
When the weight's too heavy, but you won't let go

Come to me, my brother, and I will sit with you awhile
Pretty soon, I'll see you smile and you know you will
No matter how much you're hurting right now
You know that everything will change in time
So let me carry your burden
Let me carry your burden

When your mouth's on fire, but your mind is cold
And you're fanning flames that won’t keep you warm

Come to me, my brother, and I will sit with you a while
Pretty soon, I’ll see you smile and you know you will
No matter how much you're hurting right now
You know that everything will change in time
Let me carry your burden, oh brother of mine
Let me carry your burden
Come tomorrow, you’ll be right as rain
It'll quench your fire, wash away your stains
Ooh, yes, it will, yeah

Come to me, my brother, and I will sit with you a while
Pretty soon, I'll see you smile and you know you will
Oh, it don't matter how much you’re hurting right now
You know that everything will change in time

I'm breathing deeper than I've ever done
And it sure feels good, to finally feel the way I do

Shining down on me and you
When you put your arms around me

Couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to

I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright
As headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head
And tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

Someday I'm going to run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm going to be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Because we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, oh
And you're going to think of me
Oh yeah
Ooh someday baby, someday

The rain is coming down tonight
I'm smiling, looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back to when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town

And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on a two lane road
Had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loko's, Spark, and Light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time

Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the grit and the game
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
We had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loko's, spark a light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses dryin' out on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all

When I think about those summer nights
Sneaking out the window, running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time
Hey, you know oh
All that wasted time
Don't you feel it coming on back now

I roll with the punches
I go with the flow
I used to fight against the tide
But I learned my lesson and now I know
That there's a better way to live this life
You've got to find your song and just sing it
And there's a better way to feel alright
Let it all go and let love take control

I just ride
On a wave so free, just you and me
Coming alive
It feels so good just watching the world going by
Doing my thing out here, vibing and riding my wave
Mmm, every day
Why would I wanna live any other way
Than riding my wave? Yeah

We all got problems
I've had my share of pain
I got scars in places that you can't even see, baby
But it made me who I am today
So when it rains, when there's a hurricane
You got to find your wave and just surf it
Put some love in the world, find a boy or a girl
To heal all the hurt 'cause you know you deserve it
So ride
On a wave so free, just you and me
Coming alive
It feels so good just watching the world going by
Doing my thing out here, vibing and riding my wave
Mmm, every day
Why would I wanna live any other way
Than riding my wave? Yeah

You gotta watch out for the shine blockers
Me, I'm just a time stopper
We gon' get there when we get there lil’ mama
We gotta depend on the waaaaaave
Leanin' and dreamin'
Pullin' up on the scene and we sting 'em
Focused and floatin', we drinkin' and singin'

Been a long time coming, but it's all (it's all good baby)
For the better (oh yeah)
What we can't do alone, we can all do together

Let's ride
Oh, oh
We're coming alive
It feels so good just watching the world going by
Doing my thing out here, vibing and riding my wave
Yeah, every day
Now why would I wanna live any other way?
Ride
Everyday, everyday
By
Oh, everyday, everyday
Ride
Oh, oh, oh, I feel it baby, woo, woo

We were just a couple years short of the age
By my name on a fake ID
And still 'bout a hundred away from the day
Your daddy said you could run with me
We were a couple of line steppers
Who just couldn’t wait to step over the line
Never thinkin' we wouldn't last
I was your first and you were mine

And we were leather jackets hangin’ onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin' out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mm-hmm

We were gonna make it, weren't we, baby?
Had it all laid out in our mind
By the time we knew time was runnin' out
We'd done run out of time
And we were downtown Saturday night, last-call cover band
'Til the last song played, never thought we'd fade
Like the stamp on the back of her hand
We were her on my shoulders, lighter in the air
"Pour Some Sugar On Me"
We were a top down at Johnson’s field
When she whispered that she wants me
At least there’s a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Oh, mm-hmm

We were leather jackets hangin' onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin’ out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mmm, yes, I do

My friends say
"Oh well, let that ship sail
You gotta let go of her"
Just wasn't meant to be
But somewhere down deep, I still believe
That we wereEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

New York girls, they can be so pretty
But I get cold livin' in the city, oh
Then I've got to go
And I've been west out to California
Summer nights and girls are so much warmer there
They just don't have a care
But I know a place where the people are smilin'
Takin' it easy and it's been a while since I've gone
And now it's time to go home

Give me a tight t-shirt on a real hot body
You know what's on my mind
Yeah, I'll show you where it's at
Come on, let's get back on Texas time
You gotta rock me easy, we're gonna party
Whiskey, women and wine
Yeah, I'll show you where it's at
Come on, let's get back on Texas time

I-35, Dallas down to Austin
We can find a world we can get lost in there
Where we can breathe the air, oh, oh
We can howl at the moon like a wild coyote
Cactus in bloom and the pink peyote's so fine
So fine, we got nothin' but time, hee
Give me a tight t-shirt on a real hot body
You know what's on my mind
Yeah, I'll show you where it's at
Come on, let's get back on Texas time
You gotta rock me easy, we're gonna party
Whiskey, women and wine
Yeah, I'll show you where it's at
Come on, let's get back on Texas time

And I know a place where the people are real
And they're takin' it easy and makin' you feel right at home
Yeah, that's where I'm going, hee

Give me a tight t-shirt on a real hot body
You know what's on my mind
Yeah, I'll show you where it's at
Come on, let's get back on Texas time
You gotta rock me easy, we're gonna party
Whiskey, women and wine
Yeah, I'll show you where it's at
Come on, let's get back on Texas time

Woah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, baby
And so fine, mmm, mmm
Do it to me every time
You do it to me
And you do it to me, baby, oh
Hey
Ooh, and the women so fine
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, won't you get back
Wanna get back?
Woo!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She's going to Coachella with feathers in her hair
She got the past and a dream catcher in her rear-view mirror (Woah)
Oh, the band on her shirt, they're comin' on at nine
She doesn't even know right now where she's gonna stay tonight, she gon' stay tonight (Woah)

She's on a mission, you can see
She's just gotta be free
Red lips on a refugee

Saturday night, feeling alright
Show him what he lost in my jeans skin tight
Stars coming out, the music up loud
Saturday night, feeling alright
Shades on, dancing with my hands up high
Stars coming out, the music up loud

She loves driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm
Driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm

Palm trees fading like a summer fling
Crystals on the dash, everybody singing "The Shape of You," mmm (Woah)
Yeah, Becky’s gone quiet on the passenger side
And Maddie's in the back, just a little too high
Looking like a teenage dream
Red lips on a refugee

Saturday night, feeling alright
Show him what he lost with my jeans skin tight
Stars coming out, the music up loud
Saturday night, feeling alright
Shades on, dancing with my hands up high
Stars coming out, the music up loud

She loves driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm
Yeah, driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm

Everybody sing
Mmm, mmm
Oh
Driving with her drop top

Saturday night, feeling alright
Show him what he lost with my jeans skin tight (hey)
Stars coming out, the music up loud
Saturday night, feeling alright (I'm feeling alright)
Shades on, dancing with my hands up high (with my hands up high)
Stars coming out, the music up loud
She loves driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm
Driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm
Oh, driving with her drop top down
Mmm, mmm
She's always driving with her drop top down

Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walking away

I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry

Would it help if I turned a sad song on
"All By Myself" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
It's going to hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you by hiding this way

I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes

I'm driving home tonight, catching all red lights
That's alright cause I don't want to be alone
There's nobody waitin there, cold and empty bed
Words I wished I'd said come on the radio

Ooh, oh, oh, and I don't know why I do this to myself
Ooh, oh, oh, I know you're with someone else

But in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring it back, oh, oh

So, I've been sleeping til noon in the same bedroom
Where I once held you and it's breaking my heart
I should take down all those pictures from my wall
Promises we made won't fill this empty space
Ooh, oh, oh, and I don't know why I just can't let you go
Ooh, oh, oh, I know you're never coming back

But in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring it back oh oh
But in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring it back oh oh

Mmmm
If I could bring you back
Mmmm
Just close my eyes...15EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
