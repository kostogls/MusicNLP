For those who come to San Francisco (Yo, Quinn) (—cisco)
(I know you've been waiting for this one, right?)
For those who come to San Fran— Fran—
(Boo Banga, what up?)
In— in— in— into the streets of San Francisco
(Hunters Point's prince, ha ha
The whole city, man, this San Francisco, you dig? I rep my shit)
In— in— in— into the streets of San Fran— Fran—
(Traxamillion)

Yeah, I rep my city, nobody flyer
Say something different, you a goddamn liar
Block on fire, streets stay cookin'
Girl, you lookin' for a boyfriend, then keep on lookin' (Hey)
Downtown, Fillmore, something like Brooklyn
Uptown Harlem, yeah, we ballin'
Frisco, Frisco, home of the brave
I don't know about y'all, but we gettin' paid
All over TV, still ain't changed
Good in the hood everywhere I go
Got a block full of hitters everywhere I go
You say you from the hood but you never there though (Ayy)
HP love me, Lakeview love me
Sunnydale, Towerside, let's get money (Let's get it)
Bang bang, Three Story Gang, it's a movement
Street Cred Music, son, let's do it
For those who come to San Francisco (To San Francisco)
For those who come to San Fran— Fran—
In— in— in— into the streets of San Francisco (San Francisco)
In— in— in— into the streets of San Fran— Fran—

It's a city situation
I keep Hunters Point in the equation
I'm married to the block, you just got relations
And you gon' need a doctor you play with my patience
You hatin', you'll get it in broad day
My neck shines like the lights on Broadway (Yeah)
Never gave a broad away
'Cause in Fillmore they'll get her to pay (Get her to pay)
But HP, that be me
Check my street cred, I'm in the trap all day
(All day, all day)
I just count the cash
Now my whip wet like Alcatraz
And not one bar's a fable
We got the cable car, but my car got cable
Boo Banga, I'm on demand like Comcast
And with these squares, I don't contrast

For those who come to San Francisco (—cisco)
For those who come to San Fran— Fran—
In— in— in— into the streets of San Francisco (San Francisco)
In— in— in— into the streets of San Fran— Fran—
See, we goes by no book, anybody get took
From HP to Hayes Valley we push
Come over the top of the bridge, it gets narrow
See the good girl down right on O'Farrell
Young Fillmore pharaoh, Golden Gate treasure
God at The Wharf, S.F. the letters
Roll in like fog, valley is uphill
You witness shit you will get killed
Cougnut, Mr. Cee, Hitman R.I.P
Much love from the SFC
Handle bricks in the back of Candlestick
House in Twin Peaks, view panoramic
Still with the cannon, .40 or .50 caliber
Five-time champion, destroy any challenger
Hit like Barry, score like Jerry
Still right here, Fillmore the merry

For those who come to San Francisco (—cisco)

Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh

I’m sorry music 

50,000 for the time
Ain’t worried bout a dime
Glock by my bed
Talk nasty lose your head
These Arabs want me dead
I sit back and count my bread
I’ll shoot you in the head
You heard what I just said

DJ is playing my shit
And he is bringing it back
I just sipped Henny right now
Told her to bring it right back
Pockets are heavy right now
And I just brought out my racks
And we just came up from court
And I said no facts
I was just playing your shit
We was just skipping through dat
Had to go down on your tape
Brought that shit straight to the trash (garbage)
Feeling like I am the one
Chill with your bitch and the cash
Feeling the sorry to ones
Fill up the gas with no cap
Finish the race
And you was in last
I pull up in ‘raris
I had to go blast
You lookin’ at me
But this ain’t that
I’m sorry to ones
My paperback
50,000 for the time
Ain’t worried bout a dime
Glock by my bed
Talk nasty lose your head
These Arabs want me dead
I sit back and count my bread
I’ll shoot you in the head
You heard what I just said

Spending these racks
Spending these racks at the mall
Make all this money
Make all this guap
You know I’m stacking it y’all
Pull out the range
Pull out the Benz
You know the way that I ball
Got a new bitch
I’m on ya chick
You know she gave me a call
Start up the jet
She gettin’ wet
Cuz of the way that I flex
I’m talkin’ money
They gettin’ mad
Cuz I ball with no stress
Blew up my phone
I ain’t got time
No time to check
Who is your mans
I got a salary all on my neckEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
***
Check me a bag gotta get it
I get it then flip it
I make it two times then i up on them digits
They hatin they stuck and I’m standing like bridges
Let’s get it, let’s get it, let’s get it, let’s get it
Bitch try to moan and she soundin like british
They call me lil rabbit, i race to the finish
Boy you not a dog you a cat you a kitten
I’m tryna get money for real i ain’t kiddin
You clippin they rippin I’m runnin you trippin i shoot scottie pippen
My taper be inchin my finger be itchin you pimpin a ride that ain’t yours boy you simple
Holes in yo face like a dimple, dots on your face like a pimple
This is the wave you be startin a ripple
This my time don’t hoe, don’t tickle
2018 countin green like a pickle
Bitch on my dick call her Jill no riddle
Whip it out, screamin now, bitch it ain’t little
2018 countin green like a pickle

Ow, yeah, yeah

(Speakers on blap got me feelin' like a player)
(Traxamillion)

Yeah, I'ma show you broke dudes how to get dollars
Candy paint glow on the 9-6 Impala
Inside peanut butter, outside jelly
Banger on my lap, tell the jack boys I'm ready (Yеah)
One for the money (Monеy), two for the show (Show)
Story in the building, homeboy, let's go (Go)
Ask your girlfriend, she'll tell you I'm the best
All I do is talk money, you could smell it on my breath
Hot damn, I'm the man with the plan
D-boy, right front pocket holdin' five grand
Throw it in the air, let 'em know I ain't playin'
Beat bangin' so loud they ain't hear what you sayin' (Nah)
When you rockin' with Trax' everything get deeper
A-grade blow comin' right out your speaker
Bring it to the club, tell the DJ to spin it
I don't know about y'all but over here we winnin', okay
Speakers on blap got me feelin' like a player
Speakers on blap got me feelin' like a player
Speakers on blap got me feelin' like a player
With my top laid back, my fingers in the air
Speakers on blap got me feelin' like a player
Speakers on blap got me feelin' like a player
Speakers on blap got me feelin' like a player
With my top laid back, my fingers in the air (Let's go)

Ayy, fresh white tee, fresh new kicks
Hundred-dollar jeans with a fresh new chick
Brand new chips with some brand new dip
If a homie wanna trip, then the homie cool whip (Woo)
Spit ether but I ain't Nas
New Era cap sit above my eyes
Since I was five, know I'm live
Fillmatic with the flow, Titanic size (Come on)
Yeah, since I clicked with Rich
All these little chicks jump up on my dick
Sit with the king, I could scratch that itch
If a DJ in the club then we in that mix
Underdog, under all
We stay ballin', you would fund the broads
When the game unthaw, the one to call is me
B, he a neanderthal, come on
Speakers on blap got me feelin' like a player
Speakers on blap got me feelin' like a player
Speakers on blap got me feelin' like a player
With my top laid back, my fingers in the air
Speakers on blap got me feelin' like a player
Speakers on blap got me feelin' like a player
Speakers on blap got me feelin' like a player
With my top laid back, my fingers in the air

Got me feelin' like a player
My top laid back, my fingers in the air
Got me feelin' like a player
