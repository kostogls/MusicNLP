Sting of the needle dropping on a vinyl
Neon singer with a jukebox title full of heartbreak
33, 45, 78
When it hurts this good you gotta play it twice
Another vice

All dressed up in a pretty black label
Sweet salvation on a dining room table
Waiting on me
Where the numb meets the lonely
It's gone before it ever melts the ice

Another vice, another call
Another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7 AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be back tomorrow night, oh

I wear a town like a leather jacket
When the new wears off, I don't even pack it
If you need me
I'll be where my reputation don't precede me
Maybe I'm addicted to goodbyes
Another vice, another town
Where my past can't run me down
Another life, another call
Another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7 AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be gone tomorrow night
Mm, another vice

Standing at the sink, not looking in the mirror
Don't know where I am or how I got here
Well, the only thing that I know how to find
Is another vice

Mm, another vice
Yes, another vice
Ooh, another vice
Another vice
Another vice

Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
You shouldn't spend your whole life wishin'
For something bound to fall apart
Every time you're feeling empty
Better thank your lucky stars
If you ever felt one breaking
You'd never want a heart

Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
I've been on the road that you're on
It didn't get me very far
You ain't missing nothing
'Cause love is so damn hard
Take it from me, darling
You don't want a heart

Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
I'm glad we talked this out
You can take mine if you want it
It's in pieces now
By the way there, Mr. Tin Man
If you don't mind the scars
You give me your armor
And you can have my heart7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name 'til the neighbors called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don’t know what I did next, all I know I couldn’t stop

Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama’s phone started ringin' off the hook
I can hear her now, sayin' she ain’t gonna have it
Don’t matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame

Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face
Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You only love me for my big sunglasses
And my Tony Lamas
And my Dodge Dart Classic
You said "I'll be Johnny and you'll be June
I'll ride with you to the moon"
But guess what?

You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ohhhh
Ahhhh

Oh, heaven help me

And chasin' tumbleweeds
But that's just who I be
And you're just tryin' to slow this rolling stone
But I'm on to you babe

And I've got long, blonde hair
And I play guitar and I go on the road
And I do all the shit you wanna do
And my dog does tricks
And I ain't about drama y'all
I love my apron
But I ain't your momma
So guess what?

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous
Had to back it on up, couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down a window
Where you headed to next?
Said I'm heading to the bayou with my money out of the mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened
Whoa... somethin' bad
Whoa... somethin' bad

Now me and that girl that I met on the street
We're rollin' down the road, down to New Orleans
Got a full tank of gas and the money out of the mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Bout to tear it up down in New Orleans
Just like a real-life Thelma and Louise
If the cops catch up, they're gonna call it kidnapping
Got a real good feelin' somethin' bad about to happen

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened
Whoa... somethin' bad
Whoa... somethin' bad
Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened

Yeah,  I'm a turner
I turn pages all the time
Don't like where I'm at
34  was bad, so I just turn to 35
Yeah,  I'm a keeper
I keep digging down for the deep
Like  the records I'm playing
They might keep you waiting
But you know I'm only playing for keeps

And if the house just keeps on winning
I  got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart

Ooh
Ooh
Well, I'm a giver
Yeah, and I'm still giving 'em hell
Forgiving's pretty hard
So I made an art out of forgettin' 'em well
Yeah, I'm a rhymer
I can turn 20 cents into a 10
And if I get confused and I start to lose
I rhyme a dime 'til it all makes sense

And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I turn a light on in my soul
And keep a bluebird in my heart

Ooh

There's trouble where I'm going
But I'm gonna go there anyway
I hate Sunday mornings
'Cause they always seem to start this way
I'm looking for a lighter
I already bought the cigarettes
Guess I picked me up a habit
On my way out of Lafayette
Eastbound and down
I turn it up 'cause that's sure how I feel
My mind is racing through the pines
My hands are shaky on the steering wheel
I'm going North on 59 but I know good and well
I'm headed South
'Cause me and Birmingham
Don't have a history of working out

What I lost in Louisiana
I found back in Alabama
But nobody ever taught me how to stay
It ain't love that I'm chasing
But I'm running just in case

I ain't unpacked my suitcase
Since the day that I turned twenty one
It's been a long ten years since then
It's getting kinda cumbersome
The first one and the last one
And the one that's got my name in ink
The smoker and the fighter
And the one in every song I sing
What I lost in Lubbock, Texas
I looked for in all the rest
But I guess no one ever taught me how to stay
It ain't love that I'm chasing
But I'm running just in case

I carry them around with me
I don't mind having scars
Happiness ain't prison
But there's freedom in a broken heart2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Weather man said, it’s gonna snow
By now I should, be used to the cold

Mid-February shouldn’t be so scary
It was only December
I still remember the presents, the tree, you and me

But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you

Living alone, here in this place
I think of you, and I’m not afraid

Your favorite records make me feel better
Cause you sing along
With every song
I know you didn’t mean to give them to me
But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I’ll be OK
But I’m not going to ever get over you

It really sinks in, you know, when I see it in stone

Cause you went away
How dare you?

I know they say, "You can’t go home again"
I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to Mama's dream
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could walk around, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory

Should I give up sunsets for marigold mornings?
Should I look for rainbows or wait for the rain?
Is happiness on the highway? Or is it parked in the driveway?
Should I lean on you, babe? Or should you lean on me?

Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way?

I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart goin' both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?
Am I settlin' up or settlin' down?

Be a jet-set Friday or a Sunday hometown girl
I could stay a little lonely or let you get to know me

If your mind's as cluttered as your kitchen sink
If your heart's as empty as your diesel tank
If all your white T-shirts have stains
If you've got some goods and got some ink
Well then, we should be friends

If you borrow dresses like you borrow time
If you dream all day and drink all night
If you're looking for love but willing to fight
Over men and mama's and Miller Lites
Well then, we should be friends

I don't know you well but I know that look
And I can judge the cover 'cause I read the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains

If you paint your nails while you cut your loss
If you like acting like you're the boss
If everything your daddy says
Is something you can put stock in
Well then, we should be friends
Come on
I don't know you well but I know that look
And I can judge the cover 'cause I wrote the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains
One, two, three

If you use alcohol as a sedative
And bless your heart as a negative
If you ride your white horse like the wind
If what you see is what you get

His last name was Flores
He came up from Juárez
Lookin' for a hell of a time
With a blonde señorita
And a tall margarita
We danced on the tables all night
Then I said, "Adiós
Casamigos is taking me home tonight"

’Cause he don't love me like tequila does
Nobody can
He don't give me that border town buzz
Like tequila does

I’d sure like to find
A cowboy tonight
To get me back in the saddle
But the boys around here
Drink domestic beer
They're all hat, no cattle
But I won't sleep alone
'Cause my old pal Patrón
Is taking me home tonight
They don't love me like tequila does
Nobody can
They don't give me that border town buzz
Like tequila does

Well, I might as well face it
I'm always chasin'
A kiss with a twist of a lime
When I’m drinking doubles
I’m nothing but trouble
And trouble's so easy to find
Hand me a sombrero
’Cause Jose Cuervo
Is taking me home tonight

No, they don't love me like tequila does

Nothing on this white rock but little ol’ me
I've got two miles 'till he makes bail
And if I'm right, we're headed straight for hell

I'm going home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?

Gunpowder and lead

You still kept your eyes on me

Sometimes love acts out of spite

Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushin' time

I didn't know I could be kissed like that

Stonewashed jeans while you're changing the oil
When you find yourself dating the bridesmaid's ex
You accidentally bring him to the wedding, whoops
If you pour yourself a Merlot to go
You dip your fries in your ketchup on a bumpy road
You spill the beans to your mama, sister got knocked up
In a truck at the 7-Eleven, don't sweat it

It'll all come out, all come out in the wash
Every little stain, every little heartbreak
No matter how messy it got
You take the sin and the men and you throw 'em all in

You got frisky with your boss at the copy machine
You drunk-dialed your ex-husband, don't remember a thing
Had a fancy dinner at your mother-in-law's
Spilled A1 Sauce on her table cloth
