He said "I'll love you til I die"
She told him "you'll forget in time"
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind
He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
But he still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again

He kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'
I went to see him just today
Oh but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today
You know she came to see him one last time
Oh, and we all wondered if she would
And it kept runnin' through my mind
This time - he's over her for good

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I feel tears wellin' up cold and deep inside
Like my heart's sprung a big leak
And the stab of loneliness, sharp and painful
That I may never shake
Now you might say that I was taking it hard
Since you wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I may break right down and bawl
Now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are going to the inside
My tears are holding back
They're trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all
One day I had ventured in love, never once suspecting
What the final results would be
How I lived in fear of waking up each morning
And finding that you'd gone from me
There's aching and pain in my heart
For the day was the one that I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her
And I came out in second place
Now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are going to the inside
My tears are holding back
They're trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses allEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I've known
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottle
And you brought me back from being too far gone

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And I stay stoned on your love all the time

I looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of the bottle always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there nothing like your love to get me high

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And I stay stoned on your love all the time
I stay stoned on your love all the timeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, in North Carolina, way back in the hills
Me and my old pappy, and he had him a still
We brewed white lightnin' 'til the sun went down
And then he'd fill him a jug and he'd pass it around
Mighty, mighty pleasin', pappy's corn squeezin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

Well, the G men, T men, revenuers, too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin', tryin' to book him
But my pappy kept a-cookin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

Well, I asked my old pappy why he called his brew
White lightnin' 'stead of mountain dew
I took a little sip and right away I knew
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
Lightnin' started flashin', thunder started clashin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

Well, the G men, T men, revenuers, too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin', tryin' to book him
But my pappy kept a-cookin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'
Well, a city slicker came and he said "I'm tough
I think I wanna taste that powerful stuff"
He took one s-slug and he drank it right down
And I heard him a-moanin' as he hit the ground
Mighty, mighty pleasin', your pappy's corn squeezin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'

The G men, T men, revenuers, too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin', tryin' to book him
But my pappy kept a-cookin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Chorus:
I've had choices
Since the day that I was born
There were voices
That told me right from wrong
If I had listened
No, I wouldn't be here today
Living and dying
With the choices I've made
I was tempted
By an early age I found
I liked drinkin'
Oh, and I never turned it down
There were loved ones
But I turned them all away
Now I'm living and dying
With the choices I've made
Chorus:
I've had choices
Since the day that I was born
There were voices
That told me right from wrong
If I had listened
No, I wouldn't be here today
Living and dying
With the choices I've made
--- Instrumental ---
I guess I'm payin'
For the things that I have done
If I could go back
Oh, Lord knows I'd run
But I'm still losin'
This game of life I play
Living and dying
With the choices I've made
Chorus:
I've had choices
Since the day that I was born
There were voices
That told me right from wrong
If I had listened
I wouldn't be here today

(Troy Seals and Max D. Barnes)
You know this old world is full of singers
But just a few are chosen
To tear your heart out when they sing
Imagine life without them
All your radio heroes
Like the outlaw that walks through Jessi's dream
No, there will never be another
Red Headed Stranger
A Man in Black and Folsom Prison Blues
The Okie from Muskogee
Or Hello Darlin'
Lord I wonder, who's gonna fill their shoes?

Who's gonna fill their shoes
Who's gonna stand that tall
Who's gonna play the Opry
And the Wabash Cannonball
Who's gonna give their heart and soul
To get to me and you
Lord I wonder, who's gonna fill their shoes?

God bless the boys from Memphis
Blue Suede Shoes and Elvis
Much too soon he left this world in tears
They tore up the Fifties
Old Jerry Lee and Charlie
And Go Cat Go still echoes through the years
You know the heart of country music
Still beats in Luke the Drifter
You can tell it when he sang I Saw the Light
Old Marty, Hank and Lefty
Why I can feel them right here with me
On this Silver Eagle rolling through the night

Step right up, come on in
If you'd like to take the grand tour
Of a lonely house that once was home sweet home
I have nothing here to sell you
Just some things that I will tell you
Some things I know will chill you to the bone

Over there sits the chair
Where she'd bring the paper to me
And sit down on my knee
And whisper, "Oh, I love you"
But now she's gone forever
And this old house will never
Be the same
Without the love that we once knew

Straight ahead, that's the bed
Where we lay in love together
And Lord knows we had a good thing going here
See her picture on the table
Don't it look like she'd be able
Just to touch me and say, "Good morning, dear"?
There's her rings, all her things
And her clothes are in the closet
Like she left them
When she tore my world apart
As you leave, you'll see the nursery
Oh, she left me without mercy
Taking nothing but our baby and my heart

Step right up, come on in1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Caught my wife with another man
Now I'm doin' ninety-nine
At a prison down in Georgia
Close to the Florida line
I've been here for twelve long years
And I finally made the warden my friend
So he sentenced me to a life of ease
Takin' care of ol' Red

Now ol' red he's a dangerous dog
This old boy has ever seen
He's got a nose that can smell a two day trail
Lord, he's a four legged tracking machine
Just consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators and the quicksand beds
But all these years that I've been here
Ain't nobody got past Red

Hear the warden say
Come on somebody why don't you run
Ol' Red's a-itchin' to have a little fun?
Get my lantern, get my gun
Red'll have 'em treed 'fore the mornin' come
I payed off a guard and he slipped out a letter
To my cousin in Tennessee
And he brought down me a blue tick hound
Lord, she was pretty as she could be
They penned her up in the swampland
About a mile just south of the gate
And when I take ol' Red for his evening run
And I'd just drop him off and wait

Hear the warden say
Come on somebody why don't you run?
Ol' Red's a-itchin' to have a little fun
Get my latern, get my gun
Red'll have 'em treed 'fore the mornin' come

Now old red got use to seein'
This little lady there every night
So I kept him away for three or fours days
And waited till the time was right
I made my run with the evening sun
And I smiled when I heard 'em let him out
'Cause I headed north to Tennessee
And ol' Red was a-headed south
I hear the warden say
Come on somebody why don't you run?
Ol' Red's a-itchin' to have a little fun
Get my latern, get my gun
Red'll have 'em treed 'fore the mornin' come

Now, there's red hair blue ticks dogs in the south
Love got me in there and love got me outEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I can hardly bear the sight of lipstick
On the cigarettes there in the ashtray
Lying cold the way you left them
At least your lips caressed them while you packed
And a lip print on a half filled cup of coffee
That you poured and didn't drink
But at least you thought you wanted it
And that's so much more than I can say for me

But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowing
It's funny, I don't even care
When you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses

After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talking
There's so little left to say, we haven't said
While a million thoughts go running through my mind
I find I haven't spoke a word
And from the bedroom those familiar sounds
Of our one baby's cryin' goes unheard
But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowing
It's funny, I don't even care
And when you turned to walk away
And as the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the rosesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I stopped off at the Quicksack
For some beer and cigarettes
The old man took my money
As he stared at my Corvette
He said, I had one just like her, son
In 1963
'Til the man down at the bank
Took her from me

Oh, she was hotter than a two dollar pistol
She was the fastest thing around
Long and lean, every young man's dream
She turned every head in town
She was built, and fun to handle, son
I'm glad that you dropped in
She reminds me of the one I loved back then

Then I handed him my keys and said
"Here, take her for a spin"
The old man scratched his head
And then he looked at me and grinned
He said "Son, you just don't understand
It ain't the car I want
It's the brunette in your 'Vette
That turns me on"
I had one that was
Hotter than a two dollar pistol
She was the fastest thing around
Long and lean, every young man's dream
She turned every head in town
She was built, and fun to handle, son
I'm glad that you dropped in
She reminds me of the one I loved back then

Lord, she was hotter than a two dollar pistol
She was the fastest thing around
Long and lean, every young man's dream

Just because I ask a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I rang her number by mistake today
She thinks I still care

Just because I haunt the same old places
Where the memory of her lingers everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be
She thinks I still care

But if she's happy thinking I still need her
Then let that silly notion bring her cheer
But how could she ever be so foolish
Oh where would she get such an idea

Just because I ask a friend about her
And just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I saw her then went all to pieces
She thinks I still care, she thinks I still careEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I can't take a heart that's broken and make it over again
But I know a man who can
And I can't take a soul, hm, and make it white, whiter than snow
But I know a man who can
Some call Him Savior, the Redeemer of all men
I call him Jesus for He's my dearest friend
If you feel no one can help you and your life is out of hand
Well, I know a man who can
(Sherri)
I can't walk upon the waters or calm a raging sea
But I know a man who can
And I can't cause blind eyes to open, make the lame to rise up and walk again
But I know a man who can
Some call Him Savior, the Redeemeer of all men
I call him Jesus for He's my dearest friend
If you feel no one can help you and your life is out of hand
Well, I know a man who can

The bars are all closed
It's four in the morning
Must have shut 'em all down by the shape that I'm in
I lay my head on the wheel and the horn begins honking
The whole neighborhood knows
That I'm home drunk again

If drinking don't kill me, her memory will
I can't hold out much longer, the way that I feel
With the blood from my body, I could start my own still
But if drinking don't kill me her memory will

These will old bones they move slow
But so sure of their footsteps
As I trip on the floor and I lightly touch down
Lord, it's been ten bottles since I tried to forget her
But the memory still lingers lying here on the ground

If drinking don't kill me, her memory will
I can't hold out much longer, the way that I feel
With the blood from my body, I could start my own still
But if drinking don't kill me her memory willEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Last night I broke the seal on a Jim Beam decanter
That looks like Elvis
I soaked the label off a Flintstone Jelly Bean jar
I cleared us off a place on that
One little table that you left us
And pulled me up a big ole piece of floor
I pulled the head off Elvis
Filled Fred up to his pelvis
Yabba Dabba Doo, the King is gone
And so are you
'Round about ten we all got to talking
'Bout Graceland, Bedrock and such
The conversation finally turned to women
But they said they didn't get around too much
Elvis said, "Find 'em young."
And Fred said, "Old Fashioned girls are fun."
Yabba Dabba Doo, the King is gone
And so are you
Later on it finally hit me
That you wouldn't be 'a comin' home no more
Cause this time I know you won't forgive me
Like all of them other times before
Then I broke Elvis's nose
Pouring the last drop from his toes
Yabba Dabba Doo, the King is gone
And so are you

And so are youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

As I travel through this pilgrim land
There is a friend who walks with me
Leads me safely through the sinking sand
It is the Christ at Calvary
This would be my prayer dear Lord each day
To help me do the best I can
For I need Thy light to guide me day and night
Blessed Jesus hold my hand

Jesus hold my hand
I need thee every hour
Through this pilgrim land
Protect me by thy power
Hear my feeble plea
O Lord look down on me
When I kneel in prayer I hope to meet you there
Blessed Jesus hold my hand

Let me travel in the light divine
That I may see the blessed way
Keep me that I may be wholly Thine
And sing redemption's song some day
I will be a soldier brave and true
And ever firmly take a stand
As I onward go and daily meet the foe
Blessed Jesus hold my hand

When I kneel in prayer I hope to meet you there
Blessed Jesus hold my handEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Her fingers feel so gentle with her hand in mine
Her hair feels like silk on my arm
Her lips tell me so tenderly she's mine alone
Until we part tonight and she goes home

Borrowed angel, belongs to someone else
I love my borrowed angel, I just can't help myself
That ring upon her finger don't belong to me
But she loves me and I know she'll save
Some borrowed time for me

I wish that I could have her more than just tonight
We can't go on like this, it isn't right
When that lonesome feelin' comes a-knockin' on my door
I'll call my borrowed angel to ease the pain once more

Borrowed angel, belongs to someone else
I love my borrowed angel, I just can't help myself
That ring upon her finger don't belong to me
But she loves me and I know she'll save
Some borrowed time for me

Has it been a year, since the last time I've seen her
My God, I could swear it was ten
And the ocean of liquor I drank to forget her
Is gonna kill me but I'll drink 'til then
I've been living in hell with a bar for a cell
Still paying for my cheating crime
Oh, And I've got a long way to go
Still doin' time

Still doin' time
In a honky tonk prison
Still doin' time
Where a man ain't forgiven
My poor heart is breaking
But there's no escaping
Each morning I wake up and I find
Still doin' time

Oh when your caught me cheating twice
It's twenty to life in a place
Where the sun never shines
And tomorrow you're gonna find me right here
Still doin' time
Still doin' time
In a honky tonk prison
Still doin' time
Where a man ain't forgiven
My poor heart is breaking
But there's no escaping
Each morning I wake up and I find

Imagine a world where no music was playing
Then think of a church with nobody praying
If you've ever looked up at a sky with no blue
Then you've seen a picture of me without you

Have you walked in a garden where nothing was growing?
Or stood by a river where nothing was flowing?
If you've seen a red rose unkissed by the dew
Then you've seen a picture of me without you

Can you picture Heaven with no angels singing?
Or a quiet Sunday morning with no church bells ringing?
If you've watched as the heart of a child breaks in two
Then you've seen a picture of me without youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
