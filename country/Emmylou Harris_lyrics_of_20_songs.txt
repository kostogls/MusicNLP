Go to sleep, you little baby
(Go to sleep, you little babe)
Go to sleep, you little baby
(Go to sleep, you little babe)
Your mama's gone away and your daddy's gonna stay
Didn't leave nobody but the baby
Go to sleep, you little baby
(Go to sleep, you little babe)
Go to sleep, you little baby
(Go to sleep, you little babe)
Everybody's gone in the cotton and the corn
Didn't leave nobody but the baby
You're a sweet little baby
(You're a sweet little babe)
You're a sweet little baby
(You're a sweet little babe)
Honey in the rock and the sugar don't stop
Gonna bring a bottle to the baby
Don't you weep, pretty baby
(Don't you weep, pretty babe)
Don't you weep, pretty baby
(Don't you weep, pretty babe)
She's long gone with her red shoes on
Gonna need another lovin' baby
Go to sleep, little baby
(Go to sleep, you little babe)
Go to sleep, little baby
(Go to sleep, you little babe)
You and me and the devil makes three
Don't need no other lovin' baby
Go to sleep, you little baby
(Go to sleep, you little babe)
Go to sleep, you little baby
(Go to sleep, you little babe)
Come and lay your bones on the alabaster stones
And be my ever-lovin' babyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Me and my best friend Lillian
And her blue tick hound dog Gideon
Sittin' on the front porch coolin' in the shade
Singin' every song the radio played
Waiting for the Alabama sun to go down
Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town
Me and Lillian
Just across the line
And a little southeast of Meridian

She loved her brother, I remember back when
He was fixin' up a '49 Indian
He told her, little sister, going to ride the wind
Up around the moon and back again
He never got farther than Vietnam
I was standing there with her
When the telegram come for Lillian
Now he's lying somewhere
About a million miles from Meridian

She said, "There's not much hope for a red dirt girl
Somewhere out there is a great big world
That's where I'm bound
And the stars might fall on Alabama
But one of these days I'm going to swing my hammer down
Away from this red dirt town
I'm going to make a joyful sound"
She grew up tall and she grew up thin
Buried that old dog Gideon
By a crepe myrtle bush at the back of the yard
Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard
Got in trouble with a boy from town
Figured that she might as well settle down
So she dug right in across a red dirt line
Just a little south east of Meridian

Yes, she tried hard to love him
But it never did take
Just another way for the heart to break
So she learned to bend
One thing they don't tell you about the blues
When you got 'em you keep on falling cause there ain't no bottom
And there ain't no end, least not for Lillian

Nobody knows when she started her skid
She was only 27 and she had five kids
Could've been the whiskey, could've been the pills
Could've been the dream she was trying to kill
But there won't be a mention in the news of the world
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl
Named Lillian
Who never got any farther
Across the line than Meridian
Now the stars still fall on Alabama
Tonight she finally laid
That hammer down without a sound
In the red dirt ground1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I don't want to hear a love song
I got on this airplane just to fly
And I know there's life below me
But all that it can show me is the prairie and the sky

And I don't want to hear a sad story
Full of heartbreak and desire
The last time I felt like this
I was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire

And I stood on the mountain
In the night and I watched it burn
I watched it burn, I watched it burn

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see, I could see your face

Well, you really got me this time
And the hardest part is knowing I'll survive
I have come to listen for the sound
Of the trucks as they move down out on ninety five
And pretend that it's the ocean
Coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean
Baby, do you know what I mean

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see, I could see your face
If I thought I could see, I could see your faceEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Say a prayer for the cowgirl, her horse ran away
She'll walk 'til she finds him, her darling, her stray
But the river's in flood and the roads are awash
And the bridges break up in the panic of loss
And there's nothing to follow, nowhere to go
He's gone like the summer, gone like the snow
And the crickets are breaking her heart with their song
As the day caves in and the night is all wrong
Did she dream? Was it he who went galloping past?
And bent down the fern, broke open the grass
And printed the mud with the well-hammered shoe
That she nailed to his speed in the dreams of her youth
And although he goes grazing a minute away
She tracks him all night, she tracks him all day
And she's blind to his presence except to compare
Her injury here with his punishment there
Then at home on a branch on a high stream
A songbird sings out so suddenly
And the sun is warm and the soft winds ride
On a willow tree by the riverside
Ah the world is sweet and the world is wide
And he's there where the light and the darkness divide
And the steam's coming off him, he's huge and he's shy
And he steps on the moon when he paws at the sky
And he comes to her hand, but he's not really tame
He longs to be lost, she longs for the same
And he'll bolt and he'll plunge through the first open pass
To roll and to feed in the sweet mountain grass
Or he'll make a break for the high plateau
Where there's nothing above and nothing below
It's time for their burden, the whip and the spur
Will she ride with him or will he ride with her?
So she binds herself to her galloping steed
And he binds himself to the woman in need
And there is no space, just left and right
And there is no time, but there is day and night
Then she leans on his neck and whispers low
Whither thou goest, I will go
And they turn as one and they head for the plain
No need for the whip, oh no need for the rein
Now the clasp of this union who fastens it tight
Who snaps it asunder the very next night
Some say it's him, some say it's her
Some say love's like smoke beyond all repair
So my darling, my darling, just let it go by
That old silhouette on the great western sky
And I'll pick out a tune and they'll move right along
And they're gone like smoke and they're gone like this song
Say a prayer for the cowgirl4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I heard the train in the Tulsa night
Calling out my name, looking for a fight
Well she's come a long, long way
Got a longer way to go
So tell me how a train from Tulsa
Has got a right to know

Well she sings a song so sad and high
And the Tulsa Queen don't ever lie
And she don't care where she goes
Don't care where she's been
And the Tulsa Queen ain't crying
Because I won't see you again
Hey hey hey

And I want to ride like a Tulsa Queen
Calling out to you like she calls to me
As far away from Tulsa as these ten wheels can be

Lately I speak your name too loud
Each time it comes up in a crowd
And I know it when I do
The Tulsa Queen and you are goneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She stands on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Alone in the pale moonlight
Waiting for a man, a riverboat gambler
Said that he'd return tonight
They used to waltz on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Loving the whole night through
He was a riverboat gambler off to make a killing
And bring it on back to you

Evangeline, Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away

Bayou Sam from South Louisiana
Had gambling in his veins
Evangeline from the maritime
Was slowly going insane
High on the top of Hickory Hill
She stands in the lightning and thunder
Down on the river, the boat was a-sinking
She watched that Queen go under
Evangeline, Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away
Evangeline, Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Troubles and trials often betray those
On in the weary body to stray
But we shall walk beside the still waters
With the Good Shepherd leading the way
Those who have strayed were sought by The Master
He who once gave His life for the sheep
Out on the mountain still He is searching
Bringing them in forever to keep

Going up home to live in green pastures
Where we shall live and die nevermore
Even The Lord will be in that number
When we shall reach that Heavenly Shore

We will not heed the voice of the stranger
For he would lead us to despair
Following on with Jesus our savior
We shall all reach that country so fair

Going up home to live in green pastures
Where we shall live and die nevermore
Even The Lord will be in that number
When we shall reach that Heavenly ShoreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Baby brought me in out off the highway
Made me put my money in the bank
Straightened out my crooked way of thinking
Made it purely pleasure when I drank

And it's all right
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
Lord, I'm drunk on Bluebird Wine

Now baby taught me a different way of thinking
Like how to spend my evenings here at home
Listening to the music on the radio
Drinking all the Bluebird we can hold

And it's all right
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
Lord, I'm drunk on Bluebird Wine

Well baby says he'd really love a party
We'll get some friends together feeling fine
Any friend of mine is worth his habit, yeah
A belly full of baby's Bluebird Wine
And it's all right
I've just hit my stride
The party just started
Lord, I'm drunk on Bluebird Wine
And it's all right
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat

We came out west together with a common desire
The fever we had might have set the West Coast on fire
Two months later got trouble in mind
Oh my baby moved out and left me behind
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine

The way he left sure turned my head around
Seemed like overnight it just up and put me down
Well I ain't going to let it bother me today
I've been working and I'm too tired anyway
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine

Well I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
I've been doing all I can but opportunity sure come slow
Well I'd be in the sun all day
But I'm sweeping out a warehouse in West LA
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine

I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
I've been doing all I can but opportunity sure come slow
Well I'd be in the sun all day

Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shining afar through shadows dim
Giving the light for those who long have gone
Guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on

Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem
(Beautiful, beautiful star, star of Bethlehem)
Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us the light to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on
(Shine on)

Oh, beautiful star, the hope of life
Guiding the pilgrims through the night
Over the mountains until the break of dawn
Into the light of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on
Oh beautiful star, the hope of rest
For the redeemed, the good and the blessed
Yonder in glory when the crown is won
Jesus is now that star divine
Brighter and brighter He will shine
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on
(Shine on)

Every night it's the same
I feel your heart turn cold as rain
And know that you'll be gone again
I hear the front door close
You say you got to go downtown
I guess there's someone else you've found
So why you're still coming round
Heaven only knows

Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die, that's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees how love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be, but heaven only knows

I've heard it said that talk is cheap
But still your words they cut so deep
Lay me crying in my sleep
And the pain just grows
I don't know who's right or wrong
But all we had is dead and gone
So why you keep me hanging on
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die, that's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees how love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be, but heaven only knows

I'm going to turn and walk away
There's nothing left for me to say
It wouldn't change things anyway
Oh, I suppose
The love I gave was always true
I don't know what else to do
And how I'll ever get over you
Heaven only knows

Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die, that's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees how love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be, but heaven only knows2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My life's an open book, you read it on the radio
We've got nowhere to hide, we got nowhere to go
But if you still decide you want to take a ride
Meet me at the Wrecking Ball, Wrecking Ball
I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight
Meet me at the Wrecking Ball, Wrecking Ball
I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight
I see your smokey eyes right across the bar
I've seen that look before shining from star to star
Though I can't take that chance
If you've got time for one dance
Meet me at the Wrecking Ball, Wrecking Ball
I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight
Meet me at the Wrecking Ball, Wrecking Ball
I'll wear something pretty and white
And we'll go dancing tonight
The restless line of cars goes stretching down the road
But I won't telephone 'cause you might say hello
What is it makes me feel this way?
What is it makes me want to say?

If I needed you, would you come to me?
Would you come to me for to ease my pain?
If you needed me, I would come to you
I would swim the sea for to ease your pain

Well the night's forlorn and the morning's born
And the morning's born with the lights of love
And you'll miss sunrise if you close your eyes
And that would break my heart in two

If I needed you, would you come to me?
Would you come to me for to ease my pain?
If you needed me, I would come to you
I would swim the sea for to ease your pain


Baby's with me now since I showed her how
To lay her lily hand in mine
Who could ill agree she's a sight to see
A treasure for the poor to find
If I needed you, would you come to me?
Would you come to me for to ease my pain?
If you needed me, I would come to you
I would swim the sea for to ease your pain1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I guess it's time for me to say just how it is that I feel today
Today is just like any day 'cause you've been on my mind
It really hasn't been that long, it's funny where the time has flown
Memories just keep holding on and you've been on my mind

You been on my mind sometimes
I think I must be going blind
I've seen a world, baby, without you
I don't see myself there too

Hardly does a day go by when I don't see your clear blue eyes
Many nights, I just wonder why and you've been on my mind
You've been on my mind so long
I've been thinking that something was wrong
I've told myself I should forget
I don't seem to have it yet
You've been on my mind ?
When it's all that's in my head
Guess I know what I must do
I don't think you'll be there too
Guess it's time for me to go
But as it is I'll never know
Just what it is that I long for so
And you've been on my mind

When I go, don't cry for me
In my father's arms I'll be
The wounds this world left on my soul
Will all be healed and I'll be whole
Sun and moon will be replaced
With the light of Jesus' face
And I will not be ashamed
For my savior knows my name

It don't matter where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free
It don't matter where I lay
All my tears be washed away

Gold and silver blind the eye
Temporary riches lie
Come and eat from heaven's store
Come and drink and thirst no more
So weep not for me, my friend
When my time below does end
For my life belongs to Him
Who will raise the dead again
It don't matter where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free
It don't matter where I lay
All my tears be washed awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I met my darling in the springtime
When all the flowers were in bloom
And like the flowers, our love blossomed
We married in the month of June

Our love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as a golden glow
We had sunshine in December
And threw our roses in the snow

Now God has taken my darling
And left me with a memory
One memory I will always cherish
Are these last words he said to me

Our love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as a golden glow
We had sunshine in December
And threw our roses in the snow

My darling's buried on the hillside
Where all the wild spring flowers grow
And when the winter snows start falling
On his grave I'll place a rose
Our love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as a golden glow
We had sunshine in December
And threw our roses in the snowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The streets are cracked
And there's glass everywhere
And a baby stares out
With motherless eyes
Under long gone beauty
On fields of war
Trapped in lament
To the poet's core

Oh where oh where will I be
Oh where oh when that trumpets sounds

Met an Indian boy in Ottawa
He laid me down on a bed of straw
Said don't waste your breath
Don't waste your heart
Don't blister your heels
Running in the dark


Yeah I like the heat
Of your body laying under me
May your wild lip get you where your going
With your inventions your intentions, your laughter
Your forever yearning

I walked to the river
And I walked to the rim
I walked through the teeth of the reaper's grin
I walked to you rolled up in wire
To the other side of desire


Well the heart opens wide like it's never seen love
And addiction stays on tight like a glove
Oh where oh where will I beEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There were no cuckoos, no sycamores
We played about the forest floor
Underneath the silver maples, the balsams, and the sky
We popped the heads off dandelions
Assuming roles from nursery rhymes
Rested on the riverbank and grew up by and by
And grew up by and by
Frail my heart apart
And play me a little "Shady Grove"
Ring the bells of Rhymney
'Til they ring inside my head forever
Bounce the bow
Rock the gallows
For the hangman's reel
And wake the devil from his dream
I'm going back to Harlan
I'm going back to Harlan
I'm going back to Harlan
And if you were Willie Moore
And I was Barbara Allen
Or Fair Ellen all sad at the cabin door
A-weeping and a-pining for love
A-weeping and a-pining for love
Frail my heart apart
And play me a little "Shady Grove"
Ring the bells of Rhymney
'Til they ring inside my head forever
Bounce the bow
Rock the gallows
For the hangman's reel
And wake the devil from his dream
I'm going back to Harlan
I'm going back to Harlan
I'm going back to Harlan

I meant to ask you how to fix that car
I always meant to ask you about the war
And what you saw across a bridge too far
Did it leave a scar?
Or how you navigated wings of fire and steel
Up where heaven had no more secrets to conceal
And still you found the ground beneath your wheels
How did it feel?

Bang the drum slowly, play the pipe lowly
To dust be returning, from dust we begin
Bang the drum slowly I'll speak of things holy
Above and below me, a world without end

I meant to ask you how when everything seemed lost
Your fate was in a game of dice they tossed
There was still that line that you would never cross
At any cost
I meant to ask you how you lived what you believed
With nothing but your heart up your sleeve
And if you ever really were deceived
By the likes of me
Bang the drum slowly, play the pipe lowly
To dust be returning, from dust we begin
Bang the drum slowly I'll speak of things holy
Above and below me, a world without end

Gone now is the day and gone the sun
There is peace tonight all over Arlington
But the song of my life will still be sung
By the light of the moon you hung
I meant to ask you how to plow that field
I meant to bring you water from the well
And be the one beside you when you fell
Could you tell?

To dust be returning, from dust we begin
