Katie's sittin' on her old front porch
Watchin' the chickens peck the ground
There ain't a whole lot goin' on tonight
In this one-horse town

Over yonder comin' up the road
In a beat-up Chevy truck
Her boyfriend Tommy
He's layin' on the horn
Splashin' through the mud and the muck

Her daddy says he ain't worth a lick
When it comes to brains
He got the short end of the stick
But Katie's young and man
She just don't care
She'd follow Tommy anywhere

She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
And even if they have to run away
She's gonna marry that boy someday
Katie and Tommy at the drive-in movie
Parked in the very last row
They're too busy holdin' on to one another
To even care about the show

Later on outside the Tastee Freeze
Tommy slips something on her hand
He says my high school ring will have to do
'Til I can buy a wedding band

Her daddy says he ain't worth a lick
When it comes to brains
He got the short end of the stick
But Katie's young and man, she just don't care
She'd follow Tommy anywhere

She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
And even if they have to run away
She's gonna marry that boy someday
Her daddy's waitin' up 'til half past twelve
When they come sneakin' up the walk
He says young lady get on up to your room
While me and Junior have a talk

Mama breaks in
Says don't lose your temper
It wasn't very long ago
When you yourself was just a hay-seed plowboy
Who didn't have a row to hoe

My daddy said you wasn't worth a lick
When it came to brains
You got the short end of the stick
But he was wrong and honey you are too
Katie looks at Tommy
Like I still look at you

She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
What's meant to be will always find a way
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
What's meant to be will always find a way
She's gonna marry that boy someday

She's in love with the boy2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Phone rings baby cries TV diet guru lies
Good morning honey
Go to work make up try to keep the balance up
Between love and money

She used to tie her hair up in ribbons and bows
Sign her letters with X's and O's
Got a picture of her mama in heels and pearls
She's gonna make it in her daddy's world
She's an American girl
An American girl
Slow dance second chance mama needs romance
And an live-in maid
Fix the sink mow the yard really isn't all that hard
If you get paid

Well she's got her God and she's got good wine

God knows I've known some lovers in my storied past
But those and all the others they just didn't last
And now I know why for the first time I'm in love
For the last time
My love was like a lyric with no melody
And words are only words if there's no poetry
Now I've found my rhyme for the first time I'm in love
For the last time
So many bridges burned
Without a lesson learned
I thought that I had earned this life alone
But through God's saving grace
And the beauty of your face
My heart has found a place to call my own
I never thought forever'd ever be for me
I could only guess that happiness wasn't meant to be
But now both are mine for the first time I'm in love
For the last time
So many bridges burned
Without a lesson learned
I thought that I had earned this life alone
But through God's saving grace
And the beauty of your face
My heart has found a place to call my own
I never thought forever'd ever be for me
I could only guess that happiness wasn't meant to be
But now both are mine for the first time I'm in love
For the last time
For the first time
I'm in love for the last timeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When you can't walk and there's chains 'round your soul
The burden's too heavy and you've run out of road
And you're praying out loud
As you stumble through the rain and snow
I'll walk out and find you, I'll carry you home

When you can't speak 'cause the words are too strong
And every time that you try, it just comes out all wrong
When your heart's screaming out, but no one can hear your song
Oh, I'll sing it for you, I'll carry you home

I'll carry you home, I'll carry you home
So rest your heart easy, I'll carry you home

So wander this world now, fearless and free
Climb every mountain and sail every sea
But if you wander too far into the great unknown
You know I will find you, I'll carry you home

I'll carry you home, I'll carry you home
So rest your heart easy, I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home, I'll carry you home
So rest your heart easy, I'll carry you home
Rest your heart easy, I'll carry you homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

How do I
Get through one night without you?
If I had to live without you
What kind of life would that be?
Oh now
I need you in my arms need you to hold
You're my world my heart my soul
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything good in my life
Without you
There'd be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There'd be no world left for me
And I, baby I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything real in my life
And tell me now
How do I live without you?
I want to know
How do I breathe without you?
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live?
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything
I need you with me
Baby 'cause you know that you're everything
Good in my life
And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you?
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live?

I can see you turn away
When I ask what for
You say it isn't anything
But I'm not sure
Something underneath the skin
Won't let you be
And you try to keep it in
But I can see

The woman before me
Must have been hard on you
'Cause that hurt in your eyes
I never put you through
Sometimes I think you must be talkin' to
The woman before me and you

Sometimes in an argument
It will show
When you go a little farther than
You meant to go
I know you don't mean the things
That you say
I just wanna ease the pain
That's in your way
The woman before me
Must have been hard on you
'Cause that hurt in your eyes
I never put you through
Sometimes I think you must be talkin' to
The woman before me and you

If there are sorrows that bring back a tear
Don't let them keep us apart
You ought to know you've got nothing to fear
Here in my heart

'Cause you and I will never be
Like the past
Whatever kind of memories
That you have
Nothin's gonna hurt you now
Can't you see
I already made a vow
That I can keep

The woman before me
Must have been hard on you
'Cause that hurt in your eyes
I never put you through
Sometimes I think you must be talkin' to
The woman before me and you
Sometimes I think you must be talkin' to
The woman before me and youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Mama told her baby, "Girl, take it real slow"
Girl told her mama, "Hey, I really gotta go
He's waitin' in the car"
Mama said, "Girl, you won't get far"

Thus are the dreams of an average Jane
Ninety miles an hour down a lover's lane
On a tank of dreams
Oh, if she could have only seen

But fates got cards that it don't wanna show

And that boy's just a walkaway Joe
Born to be a leaver, tell you from the word "go,"
Destined to deceive her, he's the wrong kind of paradise
She's gonna know it in a matter of time, that boy's just a walkaway Joe

Now just a little while into Abilene
Pulls into a station and he robs it clean
She's waitin' in the car
Underneath the Texaco star
She only wanted love, never bargained for this
She can't help but love him for the way he is
She's only seventeen
And there ain't no reasoning

So she'll ride this ride as far as it can go

'Cause that boy's just a walkaway Joe
Born to be a leaver, tell you from the word "go,"
Destined to deceive her, he's the wrong kind of paradise
She's gonna know it in a matter of time, that boy's just a walkaway Joe

Somewhere in a roadside motel room
Alone in the silence she wakes up too soon and reaches for his arms
But she'll just keep reachin' on
'cause the cold hard truth revealed what it had known

That boy was just a walkaway Joe
Born to be a leaver, tell you from the word "go,"
Destined to deceive her, he's the wrong kind of paradise
But it was just another lesson in life, that boy was a walkaway Joe
All he was was a walkaway Joe
Ooh, walkaway Joe
Ooh, he was a walkaway Joe
Ooh, walkaway Joe
Yes, he was a walkaway Joe1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You were the light that wounds the eye
The pain that time could not deny
I felt resistance fading fast
As if you saved the heart for last
I knew right then, no matter what
That this would take all that I've got
There's really nothing I could do
Oh, this much in love with you

So break my faith, forget my name
Either way, it's all the same
You're my first word, my last breath
My will to live when nothing's left
Tear this heart right out of me
Lock it up, then lose the key
Curse my name when you kneel to pray
I'm gonna love you anyway

I toss and turn helplessly
There's nothin' no one can do for me
You're the first thought in my soul
There's no regaining my control
And should one day I stand accused
By other loves I have refused
When hope is gone and I am weak
You are the last name I will speak
So break my faith, forget my name
Either way, it's all the same
You're my first word, my last breath
My will to live when nothing's left
Tear this heart right out of me
Lock it up, then lose the key
Curse my name when you kneel to pray
I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love you anywayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If I'd a-known the way that this would end
If I'd a-read the last page first
If I'd a-had the strength to walk away
If I'd a-known how this would hurt
I would've loved you anyway
I'd do it all the same
Not a second I would change
Not a touch that I would trade
Had I known my heart would break
I'd a-loved you anyway
It's bittersweet to look back now
At mem'ries withered on the vine
But just to hold you close to me
For a moment in time
I would've loved you anyway
I'd do it all the same
Not a second I would change
Not a touch that I would trade
Had I known my heart would break
I'd a-loved you anyway
And even if I'd seen it coming
You'd still've seen me running
Straight into your arms
I would've loved you anyway
I'd do it all the same
Not a second I would change
Not a touch that I would trade
Had I known my heart would break
I would've loved you anyway

The broken clock is a comfort, it helps me sleep tonight
Maybe it can stop tomorrow from stealing all my time
I am here still waiting though i still have my doubts
I am damaged at best, like you've already figured out

I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, there is healing
In your name I find meaning

The broken lights were a warning you got inside my head
I tried my best to be guarded, I'm an open book instead
I still see your reflection inside of my eyes
That are looking for a purpose, they're still looking for life
I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, oh, is there healing
In your name I find meaning
I'm hanging on another day
Just to see what you throw my way
And I'm hanging on
The broken lights on the freeway
Left me here alone
I may have lost my way now
Haven't forgotten my way home
I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, oh, is there healing
In your name I find meaning
So I'm holding, I'm holding on
Yeah I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I can picture you, like a photograph
I can see your smile
I can hear your laugh
No I don't have to look back
I remember you
When I'm all alone
You're all around
I tell you things, yeah I talk out loud
Ever since you left the ground
I remember you
You can ask the sun
You can ask the moon
Every day that goes by
I remember you
And even when
I close my eyes
Like a dream, you come back to life
I can't escape your love, your light
I remember you
You can ask the sun
You can ask the moon, yeah
Every day that goes by
I remember you
And I know some day
Only God knows when
I'll touch your face
And I'll breathe again
And life goes on, so until then
I remember you
Yeah, I remember you
Mmmmmmm
Every day that goes by
Oooooh

Was it the way you caught me staring
Or the dress that I was wearing that told you so?
Was it the way that I was stumbling my words
When I was trying to speak?
Did you know I was in trouble
When I ordered up a double
And I barely even drank?
Was it written on my face?
What gave me away?

Was it the way I hung around
While the band was breaking down?
It was 3 AM
Or when we finally left the bar
When you walked me to my car
Did you know?
And when we stood there in the silence
And the parking lot was quiet
Was my cover blown?
How long did it take?
What gave me away?

And did you see it when it hit me?
Feel it when you kissed me
All night long?
Was it when you took me home
And I woke up in the morning
With your t-shirt on?
Baby, did you know all along?
I was sweating, I was shaking
Every breath that I was taking
Every time we met
Was it obvious that I was blind
To everybody else in the room?
And could you tell my heart was racing?
I was falling, it was aching
Couldn't keep my cool
Tell me, what did I say?
What gave me away?

Ooh, did you see it when it hit me?
Feel it when you kissed me
All night long?
Was it when you took me home
And I woke up in the morning
With your t-shirt on?
Baby, did you know all along?

Did I ever have you guessing?
Did you know it from the second
I walked in the room?
Was it written on my face?
What gave me away?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When you walk through a storm hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of a storm is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
Walk on, walk on with a hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never, ever walk alone
Walk on, walk on with a hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never, ever walk aloneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
Well there's so much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

Cause even the stars they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts
We got yeah we got a lot at stake
And in the end
You're still my friend at least we didn't tend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not
And who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
I'm still looking up

I won't give up on us
God knows I'm tough, he knows
We got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough

This was bound to happen
It was just a matter of time
This town is just too small for
Us to really say goodbye
You're smiling that smile that
You get when you're nervous
Like you don't quite know what to do
But this is me you're talking to
This is me you're talking to
I've heard you met somebody
It didn't take you very long
And I'll admit it isn't easy
Knowing you've moved on
But I can see how you could make any woman
Fall deep in love with you
This is me you're talking to
Me, the one who really knows you
Me, the one whose heart you've broken
Me, the one who was still hopin'
You might be missing me
We don't have to do this
We don't have to act like friends
As much as I would love to
I really just don't think I can
You don't have to tell me that you really love me
After all we have been through
'Cause this is me you're talking to
Me, the one who really knows you
Me, the one whose heart you've broken
Me, the one who was still hopin'
You might be missing me

He was the kind of guy who loved so unselfishly
And everyone could see what a prize he was
Everyone but me
I must be blind
I must be the kind who don't know what they have
'Til they're all alone and sad

There goes my baby
Like the sun fallin' out of the clear blue sky
There goes my baby
And it's gonna be a cold hard night
Now that I finally see
How I need him to be
Right here by my side
There goes my baby
Bye-bye baby, goodbye

How could I have a love so fine
And not know what it's worth?
Maybe this empty heart he left behind is all that I deserve
What kind of fool finds a perfect jewel and can't see how it shines?
'Til she's all alone and cryin'
There goes my baby
Like the sun fallin' out of the clear blue sky
There goes my baby
And it's gonna be a cold hard night
Now that I finally see
How I need him to be
Right here by my side
There goes my baby
Bye-bye baby, goodbye

How I wish I could hold him in my arms and say
This time I'm gonna treat him right
But it's too late

There goes my baby
Like the sun fallin' out of the clear blue sky
There goes my baby
And it's gonna be a cold hard night

Every girl in this town's felt the wind in her hair
From the ferris wheel spinnin' at the county fair
Looked out from the top and wondered
What's out there for me
Every girl in this town's had a Friday night
That ended in tears in the yellow porch light
Thinkin' it was love, but it was just 17

And we dance and we laugh 'til we all fall down
We keep kissin' boys tryin' to figure it out
Stretchin' for stars on our tip-toe hearts
Tryin' to get our big dreams off the ground
Like every girl in this town

Every girl in this town is somebody's daughter
An angel, a devil, no matter what they call her
If they try to hold you down under that water
Just come up baptized, baby, let it make you stronger

Every girl in this town
Every girl in this town
Yeah, dust yourself off
Put your lipstick on
You got this, baby
So what if you don't?
And we dance and we laugh 'til we all fall down
We keep kissin' boys tryin' to figure it out
Stretchin' for stars on our tip toe hearts
Tryin' to get our big dreams off the ground

Like every girl in this town

I like a man who's crazy about me
I like a man who can live without me too
That's what I like about you
I like a man who will lay down beside me
I like a man who will stand up to me too
That's what I like about you
I don't want a man to be my twin
Under my thumb, under my skin
Don't want a man like a shadow on the ground
With nothin' else to do but follow me around
I like a man who will cry on my shoulder
Who don't mind if I cry sometimes too
That's what I like about you
I like a man who can make it happen
Who can get me laughin' when my whole world breaks in two
That's what I like about you
You can be soft honey, you can be strong

Everything you do you do just right
You're tender in love, tought in a fight

I was standing at the counter
I was waiting for the change
When I heard that old familiar music start
It was like a lighted match
Had been tossed into my soul
It was like a dam had broken in my heart
After taking every detour
Getting lost and losing track
So that even if I wanted
I could not find my way back
After driving out the memory
Of the way things might have been
After I'd forgotten all about us
The song remembers when
We were rolling through the Rockies
We were up above the clouds
When a station out of Jackson played that song
And it seemed to fit the moment
And the moment seemed to freeze
When we turned the music up and sang along
And there was a God in Heaven
And the world made perfect sense
We were young and were in love
And we were easy to convince
We were headed straight for Eden
It was just around the bend
And though I have forgotten all about it
The song remembers when
I guess something must have happened
And we must have said goodbye
And my heart must have been broken
Though I can't recall just why
The song remembers when
Well, for all the miles between us
And for all the time that's passed
You would think I haven't gotten very far
And I hope my hasty heart
Will forgive me just this once
If I stop to wonder how on Earth you are
But that's just a lot of water
Underneath a bridge I burned
And there's no use in backtracking
Around corners I have turned
Still I guess some things we bury
Are just bound to rise again
For even if the whole world has forgotten
The song remembers when
Yeah, and even if the whole world has forgotten
The song remembers whenEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
