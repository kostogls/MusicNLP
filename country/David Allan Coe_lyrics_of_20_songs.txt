The old man was covered with tattoos and scars
He got some in prison and others in bars
The rest he got workin' on old junk cars
In the daytime
They looked like tombstones in our yard
And I never seen him when he wasn't tired and mean
He sold used parts to make ends meet
Covered with grease from his head to his feet
Cussing the sweat and the Texas heat
And the skeeters
And the neighbors said we lived like hicks
But they brung their cars for paw to fix anyhow
He was veteran-proud, tried and true
He'd fight 'til his heart was black and blue
Didn't know how he'd made it through the hard times
He bought our house on the G.I. bill
But it wasn't worth all he had to kill to get it
He drank Pearl in a can and Jack Daniels black
Chewed tobacco from a mail pouch sack
Had an old dog that was trained to attack
Sometimes
He'd get drunk and mean as a rattlesnake
And there wasn't too much
That he would take from a stranger
There were thirteen kids and a bunch of dogs
A house full of chickens and a yard full of hogs
I spent the summertime cutting up logs for the winter
Trying like the devil to find the Lord
Working like a niggerr for my room and board
Coal-burning stove, no natural gas
If that ain't country, I'll kiss your ass

If that ain't country
It'll harelip the pope
If that ain't country, it's a damn good joke
I've seen the Grand Ole Opry
And I've met Johnny Cash
If that ain't country, I'll kiss your ass

Mama sells eggs at a grocery store
My oldest sister is a first-rate whore
Dad says she can't come home anymore
And he means it
Ma just sits and keeps her silence
Sister, she left because dad got violent
And he knows it
Mama she's old far beyond her time
From chopping tobacco and I've seen her crying
When blood started flowing from her calloused hand and
It hurt me
She'd just keep working' trying' to help the old man
To the end of one row and back again like always
She's been through hell since junior went to jail
When the lights go out she ain't never failed
To get down on her knees and pray
Because she loves him
Told all the neighbors he was off in the war
Fighting for freedom
He's good to the core and she's proud
Now our place was a graveyard for automobiles
At the end of the porch there was four stacks of wheels
And tires for sale for a dollar or two
Cash
There was fifty holes in an old tin roof
Me and my family we was living proof
The people who forgot about poor white trash
And if that ain't country, I'll kiss your ass

If that ain't country
It'll harelip the pope
If that ain't country, it's a damn good joke
I've seen the Grand Ole Opry
And I've met Johnny Cash
If that ain't country, I'll kiss your ass

I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes
Concerning the great speckled bird
I didn't know God made honky-tonk angels
And went back to the wild side of life1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, it was all, that I could do to keep from cryin'
Sometimes it seemed so useless to remain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me by my name

You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings
And you don't have to call me Charlie Pride
And you don't have to call me Merle Haggard anymore
Even though you're on my fightin' side

And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even called me by my name

Well, I've heard my name a few times in your phone book (hello, hello)
And I've seen it on signs where I've played
But the only time I know I'll hear "David Allan Coe"
Is when Jesus has his final judgment day

And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even called me by my name
Well, a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song
And he told me it was the perfect country & western song
I wrote him back a letter and I told him it was not the perfect country & western song
Because he hadn't said anything at all about mama, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or gettin' drunk
Well he sat down and wrote another verse to the song and he sent it to me
And after reading it I realized that my friend had written the perfect country & western song
And I felt obliged to include it on this album
The last verse goes like this here:

Well, I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison
And I went to pick her up in the rain
But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck
She got run over by a damned old train

And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain
No, an' you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me
Well, I wonder why you don't call me
Why don't you ever call me by my name2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well I was thumbing from Montgomery
Had my guitar on my back
When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac
He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed
Said, "It's a long walk to Nashville, would you like a ride, son?"
Well I sat down in the front seat and turned on the radio
And them sad old songs coming out of them speakers was solid country gold
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost-white pale
When he asked me for a light
And I knew there was something strange about this ride
He said
"Drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing?
Have you paid your dues, can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them, guitar strings?"
He said, "Boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
Cause if you're big star bound let me warn ya
It's a long, hard ride"
Then he cried just south of Nashville
And he turned that car around
He said
"This is where you get off boy. I'm goin' back to Alabam."
As I stepped out of that Cadillac I said, "Mr., many thanks"
He said, "You don't have to call me Mister, Mister
The whole world called me Hank
He said
"Drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing?
Have you paid your dues, can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them, guitar strings?
He said, "Boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
Cause if you're big star bound let me warn ya
It's a long, hard ride"
He said
"Drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing?
Have you paid your dues, can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them, guitar strings?
He said, "Boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
Cause if you're big star bound let me warn ya
It's a long, hard ride"
If you're big star bound let me warn ya, it's a long, hard ride4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'd heard The Burritos out in California
Could fly higher than The Byrds
Roger McQuinn had a 12 string guitar
It was like nothing I'd ever heard

And The Eagles flew in from the west coast
Like The Byrds they were trying to be free
While in Texas the talk turned to Outlaws
Like Willie and Waylon and me, hey

Well, they say Texas music's in the make
And we've been making music that is free
Doing one night stands, playing with our bands
Willie, Waylon and me, oh Mad Dog

They say The Beatles were just the beginning
Of everything music could be
Just like The Stones I was rolling alone
Like a ship lost out on the sea
And Joplin would die for the future
And Dylan would write poetry
And in Texas the talk turned to Outlaws
Like Willie and Waylon and me, hey
My name is David Allen Coe and I'm from Dallas Texas

Well, they say Texas music's in the make
And we've been making music that is free
Doing one night stands, playing with our bands
Willie, Waylon and me, oh Mad Dog

I'd heard The Burritos out in California
Could fly higher than The Byrds
Roger McQuinn had a 12 string guitar

Country DJs knows that I'm an outlaw
They'd never come to see me in this dive
Where bikers stare at cowboys who are laughing at the hippies
Who are praying they'll get out of here alive
The loud mouth in the corner's getting to me
Talking about my earrings and my hair
I guess he ain't read the signs that say that I been to prison
Someone ought to warn him before I knock him off his chair
Because my longhair just can't cover up my red neck
I've won every fight I've ever fought
Hey, I don't need some turkey telling me that I ain't country
And saying I ain't worth the damned old ticket that he bought
Because I can sing all them songs about Texas
And I still do all the sad ones that I know
They tell me, I look like Merle Haggard
And sound a lot like David Allan Coe
And the bar maid in the last town that we played in
Knew the words to every song I'd wrote
She said Jimmy Rabbit turned her on to my last album
Just about the time the jukebox broke
Yeah, Johnny Cash helped me get out of prison
Long before Rodriguez stole that goat
I've been the Rhinestone Cowboy for so long I can't remember
And I can do you every song Hank Williams ever wrote
And I can sing all them songs about Texas
And I still do all the sad ones that I know
I can't help it, I look like Merle Haggard
And I sound a lot like David Allan Coe
But the country deejays, all think I'm an outlaw
And they'd never come to see me in this dive
Where bikers stare at cowboys who are laughing at the hippies
Who are praying they'll get out of here alive
The loud mouth in the corner's getting to me
Talking about my earrings and my hair 1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We're gonna do this song for useless
Oh I was into whips and things she was into pain
And I would beat her black and blue when she called me names
Chained her to the basement wall where she went insane
And I was into whips and things she was into pain
Oh Finger Fuckin' Sally worked at Kelly's bar
She showed me her titties in Ronnie Murphy's car
She was the first lady to let me go that far
Finger Fuckin' Sally down at Kelly's bar
And Pussy Eatin' Pamela went to Kelly's high
Caught her in the bathroom, I thought she would die
Eatin' Susan's pussy, licked that sucker dry
Pussy Eatin' Pamela went to Kelly's high
Suck 'Em Silly Shirley came out after dark
She would give us head jobs in Centennial Park
All the girls would snub her, said she was a narc
Suck 'Em Silly Shirley from Centennial Park
Yes, good ole Bloody Marys' on the rag again
Pussy Eatin' Pamela's got blood on her chin
Suck 'Em Silly Shirley got caught after dark
Finger fuckin' Sally in Centennial Park
Now Pussy Eatin' Pamela's in the county jail
Suck 'Em Silly Shirley left town on a rail
They sent Bloody Mary to the pen for life
And Finger Fuckin' Sally
She became my wife
I was into whips and things she was into pain
And I would beat her black and blue when she called me names
Chained her to the basement wall where she went insane

Don't bite the dick that fucks you honey
You gotta learn to suck it funny
How those dicks taste all like rubber
Covered with goo
Some cums clear and some cums milky
Some cums thick and some cums silky
Don't bit the dick that fucks you honey
And it'll be good to you
Momma be proud of your daughter
Think of all the things you taught her
Not to go into the water till she could swim
How to cook and how to sew
What other things you know
You should have taught her about sex
That it was not a sin
You should have said
Don't bit the dick that fucks you honey
You gotta learn to suck it funny
How those dicks all taste like rubber
Covered with goo
Some cums clear and some cums milky
Some cums thick and some cums silky
Don't bit the dick that fucks you honey
It'll be good to you
You should have taught her how to suck one
If you'da taught her how to fuck one
Maybe she'd a never snuck one when you wasn't home
You could have taught her not to fight it
You could have taught her not to bit it
You could have taight her wrong from right
But you left her on her own
You should have said
Don't bite the dick that fucks you honey
You gotta learn to suck it funny
How those dicks all taste like rubber
Covered with goo
Some cums clear and some cums milky
Some cums thick and some cums silky
Don't bite the dick that fucks you honey
It'll be good to you
Don't bite the dick that fucks you honey
You gotta learn to suck it funny

Betty drove the semi, she pulled up to the pump
I thought I wanted a Coca-Cola and I started out on the jump
She said, "Hold it Dave, come quick, there's something you got to see
That man has got a dancing bear tied up to that old tree"

I said, "Dance, dance, Dakota dance all around the country store"
Me and sweet Betty ain't never seen
A bear that could dance before
Well, it's one step, two steps, three steps four
A bottle of soda and he'll dance some more
Dance, dance Dakota dance all around the country store

Well, these hippies walked up to the cage
Giving pills to that old bear
I don't know what it was they was giving to him
It had him pulling out his hair
I tried to keep time with the music
Lord with the beat on my tambourine
Gave him some wine from a mason jar and we all began to sing


Well, I went out to Los Angeles, California and I saw a semi-truck along the side of the road. It said 'Dakota the Dancing Bear' on the side of it. Now they charged you 50 cents to watch this bear dance around a truck. So I turned to Arl,o and I said "Arlo, we ought to get down off these motorcycles and walk over there and see if that's the same bear that Betty told U.S. about when she was driving the semi-truck for us back in Nashville, Tennessee." So we got down off our motorcycles and we walked over there eaten' our pickles. Now there was four or five hundred thousand of these hippies freaks standing around waiting on a rock festival. It appeared that David Allan Coe, Kris Kristofferson and the Grand FUNK Railroad was playing in town that day and their airplane had got hijacked somewhere over Chicago, Illinois. So it turned out that the people with short hair started throwing rocks at the people that had long hair, and the people with long hair started throwing the rocks back. So we come to find out in California, when they had a rock festival, you was supposed to carry your own rocks. Well, I walked up to the bears cage, and the bear looked at me, and he said: "I know you, you're David Allan Coe, and that's Arlo Guthrie that sings country and western music on jukebox radio and television. And y'all gave me some acid when I was in Nashville, and started me to dance around this truck. And I said: "That's right son, that's why I'm here, because you signed a contract with me, and you owe me twenty percent of all the money you've been making since you've been out here on the road". He said: "Man, I ain't got no money". I said: "What'd you do with it?" He pointed to the next cage, and there was a female bear over there shooting up heroine. And before I could say anything, I turned around and I saw a Greyhound bus, painted black and white, and it said the David Allan Coe show, with the Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy, and the Tennessee Hat Band on the side of it. And their was a woman driving the bus, and sure enough, it was old pusher Betty, and she didn't have no bra on, and she said to me, she said:
"Hey Dave, come here quick
Something you got to see
That man has got a dancing bear tied up to that old tree"
She said, "Dance, dance, Dakota dance all around the country store"
Me and sweet Betty ain't never seen
A bear that could dance before
But, it's one step, two steps, three steps four
A bottle of soda and he'll dance some more
Dance, dance Dakota dance all around the country store1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She went away and left me
Oh She never said a word
And even if she would have told me
I probably never would have heard
Well she once said no other woman honey
Could lay up in her bed
Now there's cum stains on the pillow
Where she once laid her head
Cum stains on the pillow
In the middle of the bed
I found me a true fine momma
And she got some damn good head
But I hope she's out there listening
To every word I said
Cause there's cum stains on the pillow
Where she once laid her head
Play it now

Here now when she took my Cadillac
That didn't bother me a bit
When she took that blue tick hound
She should've never done that shit
Never thought I'd see the day
Her love would be as dead
As the cum stains on the pillow
Where she once laid her head
Cum stains on the pillow
In the middle of the bed
Found me a too fine momma
And she's got some damn good head
I hope you're out there listening
To every word I said
Cause there's cum stains on the pillow
Where you once laid your head
Yes there's cum stains on the pillow
In the middle of bedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well the motorcycle club had a party
And all the young virgins were there
And I found a blonde with little bitty titties
And a pretty yellow ribbon in her hair
Then I told her the three biggest lies in the world
The ones my Daddy first told me
And that was the beginning of my sexual life
And the end of my fantasy
I said, "This'll only hurt for a little while
I'll only put the head of it in
I promise that I'll never try to cum in your mouth."
Met her in a local honky-tonk
Told her it was love at first sight
She was just a-lookin' for a shoulder to cry on
And a place where she could spend the night
Me, I was a little nervous - I'd never been that far before
So I told her the three biggest lies in the world
As we danced across the floor
I said, "This'll only hurt for a little while
I'll only put the head of it in
I promise that I'll never try to cum in your mouth."
Busted in a Birmingham robbery
He didn't have no money for bail
The judge bound him over to the local grand jury
And the Sheriff threw his young ass in jail
They put him in the cell with a pervert
That later tried to climb in his bed
Stuck one of them homemade knives to his throat
And these are the words that he said
Good Buddy- "This'll only hurt for a little while
I'll only put the head of it in
I promise that I'll never try to cum in your mouth."EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Need a little time off for bad behavior
The devil in me done been asleep too long
I need a little time off for bad behavior
It looks like I've been too good for too long
Well, I'm up and gone at the break a' dawn
I've been working like a regular dog
To keep my woman and the lights and the water
And the phone turned on
I've been saying, "Yes sir" all day at work
I've been saying, "Yes ma'am" at home
I've been storing up the cuss words
Keeping them under my tongue

I had this number on my mind a while
I've been fighting off the urge to call
A pretty little strawberry blonde with a Southern drawl
Some good old boys called from Alabama
Said the fish has been a missing me
And I need to renew my friendship with Jim Beam


I need a little time off for bad behavior
The devil in me done been asleep too long
I've gotta have a little time off for bad behavior

Well I'm just an old man now covered with scars
Most of them I got fightin' in them redneck bars
And A bunch of brand new tattoos that Squench put on me
He covered up the ones I'd gotten years ago
Back in prison when I was just Dave Coe
And I wasn't famous then and I wasn't free
You know I grew up in a three room run down shack
At the foot of the hill by the railroad track
Where decent folks don't go when the sun goes down
My daddy worked at the Goodyear tire and rubber company
And he worked on cars
My momma went to church and my daddy went to bars
Most people just called it the hillbilly part of town
I had a '55 Chevy when I was fifteen
I painted it red cause I was still green
Hell I couldn't even afford to buy it gas
Had a .410 rifle and a bowie knife to
Red Man tobacco that I liked to chew
And we'd count the cars when the trains went past
And if that ain't country i'll kiss your ass
Chorus
If that ain't country it'll hair lip the pope
If that ain't country it's a damn good joke
I've been on the Grand Ol Opry and I know Johnny Cash
And if he ain't country i'll kiss your ass
You know one of my sisters was a lady of the night
Then one day she saw the light
Now she don't do those things that she used to do
She never made the funeral when my daddy died
I said I'd forgive her but I guess I lied
Cause there ain't no way to hide the way that I feel
Me and my brothers took our sister Diane
Down to the funeral home to see the old man
Jimmy was the oldest and Diane she was the youngest one
Jack and Ray was in the middle and then there was me
And I'm the one that turned 23
And grew up to be that yankee's rebel son
Times are changing I heard Bob Dylan say
It's been fifteen now since my father passed away
But I can still picture him in his overalls
Standin' around the house where he made his deals
Around the porch there was a bunch of old wheels
And some used Harley Davidson parts that he sold for cash
There was fifty holes in an old tin roof
Me and my family was livin' proof
Everybody called us old poor white trash
And if that ain't country i'll kiss your ass
Chorus
If that ain't country it'll hair lip the pope
If that ain't country it's a damn good joke
I've been on the Grand Ol Opry and I know Johnny Cash
And if he ain't country i'll kiss your ass
And if that ain't country i'll kiss your ass
And if that ain't country i'll kiss your assEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I used to spend my nights in a bar room
Liquor was the only love I've known
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And I stay stoned on your love all the time

I looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of the bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And I stay stoned on your love all the timeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Quitting work early, Jimmy went home
But he never knocked on the door
Catching his wife in another man's arms
Acting like some stupid whore
He picked up his pride and took it outside
He just had to have him a drink
With his hand on his pistol he walked in a bar
And that's when he started to think
This life is turning from better to worse
The whole damn world's crazy he swore
What the hell's happening, Jesus Christ?
Ain't there nothing sacred no more?
(Chorus) Ain't there nothing sacred no more, lord, ain't there nothing sacred no more?
What the hell's happening, Jesus Christ? Ain't there nothing sacred no more
Seeking repentance, she went to the church
Expression was good for the soul
The preacher undressed her, and then he blessed her
By putting his faith in her hole
Two hours later, feeling the guilt
She finally confessed to the crime
Then you could see how they believed she wasn't out of her mind
What kind of preacher could stoop low enough
To make love to some common whore?
What the hell's happening, Jesus Christ?
Ain't there nothing sacred no more?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh, no, that ain't the way I gonna go
Oh, no, one monkey don't stop no show
Yeah-aw
Fireman wants to sue me
Said, "I'll set your ass on fire."
Said, "I'll beat ya, I'll mistreat ya."
He's a fuckin' liar
Oh, no, one monkey don't stop no show
Oh, no, that ain't the way I wanna go
Warden wants to put me
In the ee-lectric chair
Says, "Good riddance to bad rubbish."
He don't really even care
But oh, no, one monkey don't stop no show
Oh, no, that ain't the way I'm gonna go
Wa-oww!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, I've fucked 'em all from Coast to Coast...
Well you can talk about your lovers and your back door pimps
You can talk about your hollywood Fags
If you want to know the best love in the world then I'm the best mother-fucker alive
Jackie Onassis was a snuff queen for me before she ever got rich
And it would take a man a day and a half just to satisfy that bitch
Why the Queen of England gave me the keys to the whole damn Country of France
And it only took me 15 minutes to get into her pants
Well, I've fucked 'em all from Coast to Coast, cause honey, that's my bag
Fact, I'm the only guy in the world who can make Linda Lovelace Gag
Doot doot doot duh...
Now it ain't that my dick's so goddamn big, it's just that I know how to use
I'll never let no nickle-dime whore ever get the chance to abuse it
They can suck it for hours and hours on end, but I'll still be in control
And I won't cum 'til I wanna cum, cause that's my jelly-roll
Now they're ain't no woman, no match for me, I've had 'em try to wear me down
I've fucked them barmaids, and bankclerks, I even fucked a circus clown
Teachers and Lawyers doctors and more, them fat women sure are a drag
I tell you I'm the only motherfucker in the world that can make Linda Lovelace gag
Well, old Harry Reams fall apart at the seams when he saw me fuck that whore
She sucked my dick and swallowed my nuts, and I still hollered for more
She sucked my asshole, she sucked my toes, she's the suckinest bitch alive
I made her call up two more cunts, and friend that at no jive
She don't give me no shit about being no big time lover
Some movie star with a jag
Cause you ain't shit...
If you can't get Linda lovelace to gag
And don't talk about being no full-time lover, cause mister, that's my bag
I'm the only motherfucker in the damn world that can make Linda Lovelace gag
Doot doot dootEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Pussy whipped again
A fine mess I got myself in
Tryin' to be her buddy
Trying to make a woman my friend
Pussy whipped again
Blame it on the whiskey and gin
Oh Lord, I'm pussy whipped again
I took my male ego
And placed it under lock and key
I swore no God damn woman
Would ever make a fool of me
Then I met this barmaid
And my whole damn world caved in
Heaven knows when she sucked my toes
I was pussy whipped again
Pussy whipped again
A fine mess I got myself in
Tryin' to be a buddy
Trying to make a woman my friend
Pussy whipped again
Blame it on the whiskey and gin
Oh Lord, pussy whipped again
I knew my chauvinistic ways
Would someday make her change her mind
And sure enough she left me
And just in the nick of time
Her girlfriend took me around the world
To places that I've never been
She called my bluff
And sure enough
I was pussy whipped again
Pussy whipped again
A fine mess I got myself in
Tryin' to be her buddy
Tryin' to make a woman my friend
Pussy whipped again
Blame it on the whiskey and gin
Oh Lord, pussy whipped again
Play it one time...
Pussy whipped again
A fine mess I got myself in
Tryin' to be a buddy
Trying to make a woman my friend
Pussy whipped again
Blame it on the whiskey and gin
Oh Lord, pussy whipped againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
