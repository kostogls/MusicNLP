Well, I ain't never been the Barbie Doll type
No, I can't swig that sweet Champagne
I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern
Or in a honky-tonk
Or on a four-wheel-drive tailgate
Oh, I've got posters on my wall
Of Skynyrd, Kid and Strait

Some people look down on me
But I don't give a rip
I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard
With a baby on my hip

'Cause I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say "hey, y'all" and "yee-haw"
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah (Hell yeah!)
Victoria Secret
Well, their stuff's real nice
Oh, but I can buy the same damn thing
On a Wal-Mart shelf half-price
And still look sexy (Sexy)
Just as sexy as those models on TV
No, I don't need no designer tag
To make my man want me

You may think I'm trashy
A little too hard core
But in my neck of the woods
I'm just the girl next door

Hey, I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say "hey, y'all" and "yee-haw"
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah (Hell yeah!)
I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say "hey, y'all" and "yee-haw"

On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Ol' Bocephus song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah" from the redneck girls
Like me

Hell yeah!

Well
I'm an eight-ball shooting double fisted drinking son-of-a-gun
I wear my jeans a little tight
Just to watch the little boys come undone
I'm here for the beer
And the ball-busting band
Gonna get a little crazy just because I can

You know I'm here for the party
And I ain't leaving till they throw me out
Gonna have a little fun gonna get me some
You know I'm here
I'm here for the party

I may not be a ten
But the boys say I clean up good
And if I gave 'em half a chance for some rowdy romance
You know they would
I've been waiting all week just to have a good time
So bring on them cowboys
And their pick up lines

[Bridge:
Don't want no purple hooter shooter
Just some Jack on the rocks
Don't mind me if I start that trashy talk

Twenty-five times he's hit decline
On his cell phone
Quit driving by 'cause you cry every time
When he ain't home
I know you saw a diamond ring
Babies and an SUV
Bless your little broken heart
And how you fall apart

Aw, Stacy, why you gotta be so crazy
Honey, don't you thnk that maybe
You're the one to blame for running them boys away
Aw, Stacy, poor little someone come and save me
Ain't it something sad
When girls like you make women like me look bad

You ought to be out on the town running round
With your girlfriends
Instead here you sit with your fist in a clinch
Like an old hen
Gotta get a grip on yourself
Girl, you're getting hard to help
Happens every time
You find a man and lose your mind
Aw, Stacy, why you gotta be so crazy
Honey, don't you thnk that maybe
You're the one to blame for running them boys away
Aw, Stacy, poor little someone come and save me
Ain't it something sad

Well
You're a real hot cookie with your new hairdo
Your high heel boots and your credit card
Long legs and a mini skirt
Yeah, you know what works and you work it hard
You smile like such a lady
Innocent and sweet
You drive the men folk crazy
But any girl can see you're just a

Homewrecker
I know what you're doing
You think you're gonna ruin what I got
But you're not
Yeah, you little go getter
I'll teach you a lesson
If you get to messing with my man
You don't stand a chance
No, you're just a homewrecker

I'm sure you waited for a long, long time
To find a man like mine
But honey
You're too late
So before you go and make your move
Maybe me and you should get a few things straight
There's two ways we can do this
I'll let you decide
You can take it somewhere else
Or we can take it outside, you little

Homewrecker
I know what you're doing
You think you're gonna ruin what I got
But you're not
Yeah, you little go getter
I'll teach you a lesson
If you get to messing with my man
You don't stand a chance
No, you're just a homewrecker

Now, honey
I'm a Christian
But if you keep it up
I'm-a gonna go to kicking your pretty little butt
Is that clear enough?
Yeah, you little
Homewrecker
I'll teach you a lesson
If you get to messing with my man
You don't stand a chance
No, you're just a homewrecker
Yeah
You're just a homewrecker

If I had it my way
This would be the first time that I made love
And I would be the first girl that your hands touched
We've both done our share of living
Taking chances we've been given
I've never been too big on looking back
I don't care if I'm your first love
But I'd love to be your last
If I could do it over
I'd have waited for this moment
So I could give my heart to you unbroken
But if our mistakes brought us together
Does it really matter whether
We were saints or sinners in the past?
I don't care if I'm your first love
But I'd love to be your last
All I know is what I see when I look at you
And all I see is what I'm feeling down inside
And all I'm feeling is the feeling that I finally got it right
When I wake up tomorrow
I'm going to wrap my arms around you
Thank my lucky stars I found you
'Cause I know your heart has so much more than
Anyone has touched before and
Nothing matters more to me than that
I don't care if I'm your first love
But I'd love to be your last
I don't care if I'm your first love
But I'd love to be your lastEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Five of the PM rolls around
There's a little old joint outside of town
I only got time for a couple of beers
And a jukebox song ringing in my ears
The next you know
The bartenders pouring
Shots are flowing
Got me stoning
All I really know is that I should be going
But I'm soaking up the moment

I'm all jacked up
All jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Time sure flies
When you're all jacked up

It was getting mighty close to nine o'clock
What the hell
I have one more shot
Then I winked at a boy at the end of the bar
Guess I mighta musta gone a little too far
Cause a big 'ol girl walked outta the blue
Ten foot, two
With a bad attitude
Stepped right up
And knocked out my tooth
Guess I had it coming I deserved the due

Cause I was all jacked up
All jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't start no stuff
When you're all jacked up

Don't have to go home
But you can't stay here
That's what they said when I got my last beer

Oh my God, it's 2:00
I can't find my keys and my trucks locked
So I grabbed a tire tool
And I broke my window
Hurt my elbow
Got me in though
Two foot later
Backed into the light pole
All the town folk got a good show

All jacked up
All jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't drive your truck
When you're all jacked up
Jacked up
(All jacked up, all jacked up)
Ooh, oooh, oooooh
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't start no stuff
When you're all jacked up
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't drive your car
Don't start no stuff in no bar
Hell
I wouldn't even tell anybody where you are
When you're all jacked up
All jacked up
All jacked up
All jacked up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I got a feeling
A bad feeling
You're leaving and baby that's just got me mad
Thinking and crazy drinking
And I'm sinkin'
And I'm reachin'
For something to believe in
I feel it slippin' away
There just ain't nothin' to say
I did all I can do
Was it enough for you?
Look at what we've been through
I can't take another day
I got a feeling
A bad, bad feeling
I should be leavin'
'Cause I've been doin' nothing
Oh, lyin' while you keep on tryin'
Askin' me what is wrong
You keep holding on
Girl, I'm already gone
I feel it slippin' away
There just ain't nothin' left to say
I did all I could do
Was it enough for you?
Look at what we've been through
I can't take another day
It's gonna hurt when it's over
Oh but if I stay
One more day
I'm gonna lose my mind
I feel it slippin' away
There just ain't nothin' left to say
I did all I could do
Was it enough for you?
Look at what we've been through
I can't take another day

A bad feeling

I've never done anything
That would ever bring a tear to your eye
I've never crossed the line
Or needed an alibi to cover up a lie
But, darling
I'll admit
There've been times when I could have
The thing that kept me strong
Is the one thing that is always on my mind

When I think about cheating
I just think about you leaving
And how my world would fall to pieces
If I tossed your love away
Even when I'm tempted by some stranger
Oh, there's never any danger
I just think about you leaving
When I think about cheating

There was a time in Abilene
When he said all the things I wanted to hear
It was hard to turn him down
Between the champagne
And the sound of whispers in my ear
But it just took one two-step with someone
And I was missing you
He never had a chance
Cause I broke up the dance
Before the song was through

Sometimes we fight
'Bout who's wrong and right
And stay up all night
And sometimes we drink
And say hurtful things
That we don't mean
Yeah, we're both screaming
But nobody's listening
Let's take this madness out of the kitchen

Come to bed
Let's just lay down
There's just one way
We're gonna work this out
Forget what I did
Forget what you said
Oh, darling
Come to bed

Well, I love you
You know I do
And you love me too
So let's just stop
Remember what we've got
Before it all gets lost
Just take my hand
It's been way too long
Turn out the lights
And turn each other on


And let's put aside our prideful feelings
For tonight
In the morning
We'll see things in a different light

I don't need whiskey to drown out the pain
Or some old umbrella to hold off the rain
Don't have to cross over a river of tears
All that I need is right here

Holding you
Holds me together
When holding on
Gets just a little too hard
When this tightrope I travel
Begins to unravel
And I feel like I'm falling apart
Holding you
Holds me together

You know life's a freight liner on a runaway track
But I'll take the ride
Knowing that you'll bring me back
No fate's too uncertain
No distance to far
As long as you're here in my arms

Whenever I hold you tight
This crazy world of mine falls right in place
Whatever the trouble is
You find a way to give back what it takes
When this tight rope I travel
Begins to unravel
And I feel like I'm falling apart
Holding you
Holds me together
Holding you
Holds me togetherEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The Girl I Am
Sometimes I cry for no good reason
Sometimes I fight when I ain't mad
Sometimes it hurts and I ain't bleeding
Sometimes I laugh when things go bad
(Chorus:)
But I'll always be the girl I am
When life comes falling down on me I do the best I can
I never make apologies cause I don't give a damn
I'll guess I'll always be the girl I am
Sometimes I know there's something missing
Sometimes I want to start again
Sometimes I scream and none listens
Sometimes I feel like giving in
(Repeat Chorus:)
But I'll always be the girl I am
And When life comes falling down on me I do the best I can
And I never make make apologies cause I don't give a damn
I guess I'll always be the girl I am
And I never make apologies cause I don't give a damn

I walked through the door, you're there on the couch
Your dirty laundry is all through the house
The whiskey bottle is almost half drank
I'd join you, honey, but there ain't no money left in the bank

So it's back to the grind
Another day at the salt mines
Loving you is so hard
It makes a stone women torn
Then you think I'd just quit
But you're to good in bed
So it's back to the grind
Another day at the salt mines
To do it again

My momma told me to marry a good man
But I found somebody that don't give a good damn
I think about leaving about everyday
But I ain't no quitter, I'm a go-getter, so I'm here to stay

And it's back to the grind
Another day at the salt mines
Loving you is so hard
It makes a strong women torn
And you think I'd just quit
But you're to good in bed
So it's back to the grind
Another day at the salt mines
To do it again

And you think I'd just quit

I'm for the low man on the totem pole
And I'm for the underdog, God bless his soul
And I'm for the guys still pulling third shift
And the single mom raising her kids
And I'm for the preacher who stay on their knees
And I'm for the sinner who finally believed
And I'm for the farmer with dirt on his hands
And the soldiers who fight for this land

And I'm for the bible
And I'm for the flag
And I'm for the working man
Me and Ol' Hag
I'm just one of many who can't get no respect
Politically uncorrect

I guess my opinion is all out of style
Don't get me started because I can get wild
And I'll make a fight for the forefather's plan

Hell, the world already knows where I stand

Built this thing with hammer and nails
In front of this trailer all by myself
Forty-eight two by fours laid down
Little piece of heaven on a lot in town
Smile at the people when the people pass by
'Cause they're all wishing they had one like mine
Made for a chair and cooler of ice
Good times here ain't hard to find
I love sitting on a big wood deck
Ice cold beer in between my legs
Ain't nothing better or more redneck
Sitting round sitting on a big wood deck
I love sitting on a big wood deck
Rails wrapped up in extension cords
I can drop my ashes in between these boards
Rolling into polyurethane stains
She's a little wore out, but I don't complain
Someday when this town decides
This here land be citified
I might have to pull my house away
But my wood deck will still remain
'Cause I love sitting on a big wood deck
Tall Boy can in between my legs
Ain't nothing better or more redneck
Than sitting round sitting on a big wood deck
I love sitting on a big wood deck
We love sitting on a big wood deck
Iced down beer in a big ol' keg
Ain't nothing better or more redneck
Than sitting round sitting on a big wood deck
I love sitting on a big wood deck

Tiny hands on a lipstick case
I'd watch my mama paint her face
Just like she did every day
And I'd watch her wipe the tears away
My daddy, he'd go off to work
Yeah, almost like he wasn't rehearsed
From time to time he'd twirl me round
But he always let my mama down

What to do when love leaves scars
You just stay pretty
Then if you feel ugly in that heart, don't worry

Well, you grow up and you take his hand
Put all your trust in that man

I ain't never had a problem with California
There's a lot of good women from Sacramento to Corona
But them Hollywood types
After a while wear on you
Strutting around in their size zeros
Skinny little girls, no meat on their bones
Never even heard of George Jones

Ain't you glad we ain't all California girls
Ain't you glad there's still a few of us left
That know how to rock your world
Ain't afraid to eat fried chicken
And dirty dance to Merle
Ain't you glad we ain't all California girls

There ain't nothing wrong with plastic surgery
Well, Dolly Parton never looked so good to me
Everybody ought to be exactly who they want to be
But that Paris Hilton gets under my skin
With her big fake smile
And her painted-on tan
She'd never have a chance at a real man

Ain't you glad we ain't all California girls
Ain't you glad there's still a few of us left

Well, they're flicking on the bar lights
Band's playing one last song
And if you want another round
Better order it now
It's last call
Crowd's still rocking
And it's 2:01
The bartender's screaming at the top of his lungs

You don't have to go home
But you can't stay here
You can walk
You can crawl
Get carried off by the law
But you will get the hell out of here
You don't have to go home

Well, there's a couple hiding out
Getting down in a bathroom stall
And there's a $20 bet
Just waiting on the 8-ball to fall
Everybody's begging
For one last shot
Before they kick our butts into the parking lot
