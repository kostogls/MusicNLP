Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue

I knew, you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday, you'd leave me for somebody new

Worry, why do I let myself worry?
Wondering, what in the world did I do?

Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you
Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

See the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sunrise on a tropic isle
Just remember darling all the while
You belong to me
See the market place in Old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me

I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember until you're home again
You belong to me1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I go out walking after midnight
Out in the moonlight just like we used to do
I'm always walking after midnight, searching for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way of saying, I love you
I'm always walking after midnight, searching for you

I stopped to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I go out walking after midnight
Out in the starlight
Just hoping you may be somewhere walking
After midnight searching for me

I stopped to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be
I'm out walking after midnight, out in the starlight
Just hoping maybe you're somewhere
Walking after midnight, searching for me2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I am weak but thou art strong
Jesus, keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk, let me walk close to Thee
Just a closer walk with thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be
And when my feeble life is o'er
And time for me shall be no more
Guide me gently, safely o'er
To thy kingdom's shore, to thy shore
Just a closer walk with thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be
(Just a closer walk with Thee)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I've got your picture that you gave to me
And it's signed with love, just like it used to be
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got your picture, she's got you
I've got the records that we used to share
And they still sound the same as when you were here
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got the records, she's got you

I've got your memory or has it got me?
I really don't know but I know it won't let me be
I've got your class ring that proved you cared
And it still looks the same as when you gave it dear
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got these little things, she's got you

I've got your memory or has it got me?
I really don't know but I know it won't let me be
I've got your class ring that proved you cared
And it still looks the same as when you gave it dear
The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got these little things, she's got you2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Blue, oh, so lonesome for you
Why can't you be blue over me?
Blue, oh, so lonesome for you
Tears fill my eyes 'til I can't see
Three o'clock in the mornin'
Here am I
Sitting here so lonely
So lonesome I could cry
Blue, oh, so lonesome for you
Why can't you be blue over me?
Now that it's over, I realized
Those weak words you whispered
Were nothing but lies
Blue, oh, so lonesome for you
Why can't you be blue over me?
Why can't you be blue over me?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I fall to pieces
Each time I see you again
I fall to pieces
How can I be just your friend?

You want me to act like we've never kissed
You want me to forget, pretend we've never met
And I've tried and I've tried but I haven't yet
You walk by and I fall to pieces

I fall to pieces
Each time someone speaks your name
I fall to pieces
Time only adds to the flame

You tell me to find someone else to love
Someone who'll love me, too, the way you used to do
But each time I go out with someone new
You walk by and I fall to pieces1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Two cigarettes in an ashtray
My love and I, in a small cafe
Then a stranger came along
And everything went wrong
Now there's three cigarettes
In the ashtray

I watched her take him from me
And his love is no longer my own
Now they are gone and I sit alone
And watch one cigarette burn away
I watched her take him from me
And his love is no longer my own
Now they are gone and I sit alone
And watch one cigarette burn away1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Strange how you stopped loving me
How you stopped needing me
When she came along
Oh, how strange
Strange you changed like night and day
Just up and walked away
When she came along
Oh, how strange

Well, I guess that I was just your puppet
You held on a string
To think I thought you really loved me
But look what thoughts can bring
Strange you're still in all my dreams
Oh, what a funny thing
I still care for you
Oh, how strange
Well, I guess that I was just your puppet
You held on a string
To think I thought you really loved me
But look what thoughts can bring
Strange you're still in all my dreams
Oh, what a funny thing
I still care for you
Oh, how strange
How strange, how strange, how strangeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
Well, it was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
For that moonlit pass that only he would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendour known only to my heart
Call back my rose rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own

Broken song empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose my rose of San Antone

And rose my rose of San AntoneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If you've got leavin' on your mind
Tell me now, get it over
Hurt me now, get it over
If you've got leavin' on your mind

If there's a new love in your heart
Tell me now, get it over
Hurt me now, get it over
If there's a new love in your heart

Don't leave me here in a world
Filled with dreams that might have been
Hurt me now, get it over
I may learn to love again

If there's a new love in your heart
Tell me now, get it over
Hurt me now, get it over
If there's a new love in your heart
Hurt me now, get it over
If there's a new love in your heartEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm back in baby's arms
How I missed those lovin' arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms

Don't know why we quarreled
We never did before
Since we found out how it hurt
I bet we never quarrel anymore

I'm back in baby's arms
How I missed those lovin' arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms

Thought I didn't need his love
'Til he took it away
Now I'm back where I belong
And in my baby's arms I'm gonna stay

I'm back in baby's arms
How I missed those lovin' arms
I'm back where I belong

Got a feeling because I'm blue, oh, Lord
Since my daddy said goodbye
I don't know what I'm going to do
All I do is sit and cry, oh, lord
That last long day he said goodbye
Oh, Lord, I thought I would die
He'll do you, he'll do me
He's got that kinda loving
But, Lord, I love to hear him
When he calls me sweet baby
What a beautiful dream
I hate to think it all over
I lost my heart it seems

I've grown so used to that man, somehow
And I'm nobody's sugar-baby now
Because I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues

Now I'm in love
I'm in love with a wonderful guy
That's what's the matter with me
Well, I'm in love
I'm in love with a wonderful guy
But he don't care about me
Well, I tried and I tried to keep him satisfied
But he just wouldn't stay
But now that he is leaving
This is all I've got to say
I got a feeling cause I'm blue, oh Lord
Since my daddy said goodbye
I don't know what I'm going to do
I lost my heart it seems

Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

You don't love me its plain
I should know I'll never wear your ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

Sweet dreams of you
Things I know can't come true
Why can't I forget the past, start loving someone new
Instead of having sweet dreams about youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I love you so much, it hurts me
Darling, that's why I'm so blue
I'm so afraid to go to bed at night
Afraid of losing you

And there's nothing I can do
I want to hold you my dear, forever and ever
I love you so much, it hurts me soEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You made me love you
I didn't want to do it
I didn't want to do it
You made me want you
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it
You made me happy sometimes
Sometimes you made me glad
But there were times, dear
You made me feel so bad

You made me sigh for
I didn't want to tell you
I didn't want to tell you
I want some loving, that's true
Yes I do, indeed I do, you know I do
Give me, give me, give me what I cry for
You know you got the brand of kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me love youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

As I look at the letters that you wrote to me
It's you that I am thinking of
As I read the lines, that to me were so dear
I remember our faded love

I miss you, darling, more and more everyday
As Heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love

As I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
As I watched the mating of the dove
It was in the spring time that you said goodbye
I remember our faded love

I miss you, darling, more and more everyday
As Heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love

And remember our faded loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Heartaches, heartaches
My loving you meant only heartaches
Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me
I can't believe it's just a burning memory

Heartaches, heartaches
What does it matter how my heart breaks
I should be happy with someone new
But my heart aches for you
Heartaches, heartaches
My loving you meant only heartaches
Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me

Ay ay ay ay

South of the border, down Mexico way
That's where they fell in love when stars above came out to play
And now as they wander, their thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way
She was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while he kissed the smile upon her face
For it was Fiesta and they were so gay
South of the border, down Mexico way
Then she sighed as she whispered "Manana"
Never dreaming that they were parting
And he lied as he whispered "Manana"
For that tomorrow never came
South of the border, he rode back one day
There in a veil of white by candlelight she knelt to pray
The mission bells told him that he mustn't stay
South of the border, down Mexico way

He takes me to the places you
And I used to go
He tells me over and over
That he loves me so

He gives me love
That I never got from you
He loves me too, his love is true
Why can't he be you?

He never fails to call and tell
Me I'm on his mind
And I'm lucky to have such a guy
I hear it all the time

And he does all the things
That you would never do
He loves me too, his love is true
Why can't he be you?

He's not the one
Who dominates
My mind and soul
And I should love him so
'Cause he loves me, I know
But his kisses leave me cold
He sends me flowers, calls on the hour
Just to prove his love
And my friends say when he's around
I'm all he speaks of

And he does all the things
That you would never do
He loves me too, his love is true
Why can't he be you?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
