Boy, you sure look good there standin' in the doorway in the sunset light
Maybe I read you wrong thinkin' you could be my "Mr. Right"
I was puttin' my heart and soul on the line
Said you needed some time, just a little more time to make up your mind
Well, it's been long enough
Time is up

Bye-bye, love, I'll catch you later
Got a lead foot down on my accelerator and the rear view mirror torn off
'Cause I ain't never lookin' back, and that's a fact
I've tried all I can imagine
I've begged and pleaded in true lover's fashion
I've got pride, I'm takin' it for a ride
Bye-bye, bye-bye, my baby, bye-bye

Don't think all those tears are gonna hold me here like they've done before
You'll find what's left of us in a cloud of dust on Highway 4
Baby, what did you expect me to do?
Just sit around and wait on you?
Well, I'm through watchin' you just skate around the truth
And I know it sounds trite
I've seen the light
Bye-bye, love, I'll catch you later
Got a lead foot down on my accelerator and the rear view mirror torn off
'Cause I ain't never lookin' back, and that's a fact
I've tried all I can imagine
I've begged and pleaded in true lover's fashion
I've got pride, I'm takin' it for a ride
Bye-bye, bye-bye, my baby, bye-bye

I've lost the game, I guess
I did my best to win the part
Now I'm leavin' here with what's left of my heart

Bye-bye, I'll catch you later
Got a lead foot down on my accelerator and the rear view mirror torn off
'Cause I ain't never lookin' back
You can count on that
I've tried all I can imagine
I've begged and pleaded in true lover's fashion
I've got pride, I'm takin' it for a ride
Bye-bye, bye-bye, my baby, bye, bye-bye

Bye-bye
Ooh, baby
Ohhh
Bye-bye, bye-bye, my baby, bye-byeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I came by today to see you
I just had to let you know
If I knew the last time that I held you was the last time
I'd have held you, and never let go
Oh, it's kept me awake nights, wondering
I lie in the dark, just asking why
I've always been told
You won't be called home
Until it's your time
I guess Heaven was needing a hero
Somebody just like you
Brave enough to stand up
For what you believe
And follow it through
When I try to make it make sense in my mind
The only conclusion I come to
Is Heaven was needing a hero
Like you
I remember the last time I saw you
Oh, you held your head up proud
I laughed inside
When I saw how you were standing out in the crowd
You're such a part of who I am
Now that part will just be void
No matter how much I need you now
Heaven needed you more
'Cause Heaven was needing a hero
Somebody just like you
Brave enough to stand up
For what you believe
And follow it through
When I try to make it make sense in my mind
The only conclusion I come to
Is Heaven was needing a hero
Like you
Is Heaven was needing a hero
And that's youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Baby, what do you say we just get lost?
Leave this one horse town like two rebels without a cause
I've got people in Boston, ain't your Daddy still in Des Moines?
We can pack up tomorrow, tonight let's flip a coin

Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where, it don't matter as long as we're going
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California

We can load what we own in the back of a U-Haul van
Couple of modern day Moses' searching for the promised land
We can go four hundred miles before we stop for gas
We can drive for a day and then we'll take a look at the map

Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where, it don't matter as long as we're going
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California
We're gonna get outta here
If we have to ride a Greyhound bus
Boy, we're bound to outrun
The bad luck that's been tailing us

Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where, it don't matter as long as we're going
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California
Ohh California, Carolina, CaliforniaEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, it's been a long time, glad to see your face
I knew we'd meet again, another time, another place
Can't believe it's been so many years
You'd better grab a chair and a couple of beers
Looking good in your three-piece suit
You know, I always knew you'd take the business route
You were always the one to follow the light
And you look like you're doing alright, yeah

Been singing for my rent and singing for my supper
I'm above the below and below the upper
I'm stuck in the middle where money gets tight
But I guess I'm doing alright

I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight
So I guess I'm doing alright
I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
I got a good old friend here with me tonight
And I guess I'm doing alright

Well, we had a lot of dreams when we were younger
They thought we were crazy, but we had the hunger
We kept a lot of friends, skipped a lot of class
Been on top of the world and knocked on our
We lost touch, we lost in love
We lost our minds when things got tough
But beating time is a losing fight
And I guess I'm doing alright
Oh, I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight
So I guess I'm doing alright
I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
I got a good old friend here with me tonight
And I guess I'm doing alright
Well, I guess I'm doing alright

Well, I hate to see this evening end
God only knows when I'll see you again
Just send a fax or send me a letter
Or give me a call, that would even be better
Give the kids a kiss for me
And say hello to the family
And tell them all my future's looking bright
Well, I miss 'em but I'm doing alright
I said I miss 'em but I'm doing alright

Oh, I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight
So I guess I'm doing alright
I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
Got a good old friend here with me tonight

Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me

Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me

Ooh

Another day has almost come and gone
Can’t imagine what else could wrong
Sometimes I’d like to hide away somewhere and lock the door
A single battle lost but not the war

'Cause tomorrow’s another day
And I’m thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain

It’s almost like the hard times circle ‘round
A couple drops and they all start coming down
Yeah, I might feel defeated
I might hang my head
I might be barely breathing
But I’m not dead

'Cause tomorrow’s another day
And I’m thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain
No, I’m not gonna let it get me down
I’m not gonna cry
And I’m not gonna lose any sleep tonight

'Cause tomorrow's another day
And I am not afraid
So bring on the rain

Tomorrow’s another day
And I’m thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain

Ooh
Bring on, bring on the rain
No, I'm not gonna let it get me down
I'm not gonna cry
So bring on the rain (ay-e-ay-e-ain)

Have you ever stepped outside, felt the sun on your face?
Seen the waters of the ocean,reach so far they start to fade?
Have you ever seen a mountain top reach up and kiss the sky?
That's God
Have you ever seen the wonder in the eyes of a child?
Or felt the way the room lights up with that tiny little smile?
Witnessed their amazement at the simplest of things?
That's God
If you take the time to look around, you'll see it everywhere
It's right here all around us, even when we're not aware
It doesn't have to be a miracle
It might just be the little things
And even those who say they don't believe
They may not know it but everyday they see...
That's God
Have you ever heard a song and reached inside your soul?
It says what you can't say - let's you know you're not alone
You find the inspiration to keep on holdin' on
That's God
If you take the time to look around
You'll see it everywhere
It's right here all around us
Even when we're not aware
It doesn't have to be a miracle
It might just be the little things
And even those who say they don't believe
They may not know it but everyday they see...
That's God
Oh, when people make a difference just being who they are
Or when someone wants to lend a helping hand
Maybe it's somebody who just takes the time to listen to let you know that they understand
Have you ever known a love that opens up your heart
Selfless and encouraging to help you reach the stars
Patient and forgiving and accepts you as you are?
That's GodEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, you filled up my head with so many lies
You twisted my heart 'til something snapped inside
I'd like to give it one more try
But my give a damn's busted
You can crawl back home, say you were wrong
Stand out in the yard and cry all night long
Go ahead and water the lawn
My give a damn's busted

I really wanna care
I wanna feel somethin'
Let me dig a little deeper
No, sorry, nothing

You can say you've got issues, you can say you're a victim
It's all your parents fault, I mean, after all, you didn't pick 'em
Maybe somebody else has got time to listen
My give a damn's busted
Well your therapist says it was all a mistake
A product of the Prozac and your codependent ways
So, who's your enabler these days?
My give a damn's busted
I really wanna care
I wanna feel something
Let me dig a little deeper
No, still nothing

It's a desperate situation, no tellin' what you'll do
If I don't forgive you, you say your life is through
C'mon, give me something I can use

Now I do the things I do

Because you love me

I believe in the message of a dream
And I believe in what you are

And every day I'll let it show

Everybody wants an easy ride
On the merry-go-round that we call life
Take a drive on cruise control
Then you wait to find it's a winding road
I had my dreams in view
When the money ran out and the engine blew
Hung my tears out to dry
Then my dreams fell out of that clear blue sky

And I, I was walkin' the clouds
Feelin' so safe and sound
Somethin' else knocks me down

Well, oh, that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
You live you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss (that's the way)
And that's the way it is

One fine day you wake up
Completely, hoplessly fallin' in love
He's just what you're lookin' for
The only problem is, that the man's not sure
Another guy'll give you everything
The only problem is you don't feel a thing
Well, I know from experience
Nothin's ever gonna make perfect sense
Oh, one day you get what you want
But it's not what you think
Then you get what you need

Well, oh, that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
You live you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss (that's the way)
And that's the way it is

Yeah
They say your soul is growin' but
Sometimes I feel like throwin' somethin'

And that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
And that's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
That's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
You live you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss
Oh, and that's the way it is
Oh, that's the way it is (that's the way it is)
Yeah (that's the way it goes)

He left me cryin' late one Sunday night outside of Boulder
He said he had to find himself out on the road
I guess when love goes wrong, you've gotta learn to be strong
So I worked two jobs and I moved three times
I ended up south of Memphis, workin' down in Riverside
I may not be so lucky in love
But the one thing I'm sure of

I want a man that stands beside me
Not in front of or behind me
Give me two arms that wanna hold me
Not own me
And I'll give all the love in my heart
Stand beside me
Be true, don't tell lies to me
I'm not lookin' for a fantasy
I want a man who stands beside me

I didn't expect to see him one hot July mornin'
His hair was longer but his eyes were the same old blue
He said, "I've missed you for so long
Oh baby, what can I do?"
I said, "I want a man that stands beside me
Not in front of or behind me
Give me two arms that wanna hold me
Not own me
And I'll give all the love in my heart"

It's hard to tell him no when I want him so bad
But I've got to be true to my heart
This time

I'm not lookin' for a fantasy
I want a man who stands beside me
I want a man
Who stands beside me
Stand beside me
Stand beside me

I haven't been myself these days according to friends
I tend to lose a part of me when my heart is on the mend
I'll be alright it's safe to say
'Cause just like your love, this is only a phase

Well, I've been down this road a time or two, it's nothing new
Well, I'll get on my feet and over you
I tell myself that everything will be just fine
Oh, I'm just going through a little downtime

Some might think I've gotten caught up in heartache's aftermath
But your memory's taken second to a good book and nice long bath
I must admit it threw me at first
But I'm convinced I'm over the worst

Oh, I've been down this road a time or two, it's nothing new
Oh, I'll get on my feet and over you

6 A.M. I'm out of bed, I stumble through the haze
Ain't no coffee strong enough to get me through my day
One thing to another, there's no time to stop
I hit the ground a runnin' and keep runnin' 'til I drop
I'm taking care of everyone, oh, my heads in a spin
I tried but I just don't remember signing up for this
Before I leave the house, I pack a diaper bag with clothes and snacks
Laptop, cell phone, find my keys, feed the dogs before I leave
Everybody's needs are my responsibility
It sure'd be nice to have somebody taking care of me, yeah
Why, why, why, why?
When I'm through with this life
I am gonna have a come to Jesus
You can guarantee
When I walk through those pearly gates
I am gonna have a talk with Eve
There's so many things that I can't begin to understand
The differences that are between a woman and a man
See woman they do twice the work and get half the pay
Men they climb the ladder while the women pave the way
They say we are the weaker sex, I'd have to disagree
I'd walk a mile in his shoes if he'd walk a half a mile in these
Why, why, why, why?
When I'm through with this life
I am gonna have a come to Jesus
You can guarantee
When I walk through those pearly gates
I am gonna have a talk with Eve
Botox, peels, exfoliate, we have the babies, lose the weight
Laundry, dishes, up all night, I try my best to get it right
Husband, kids, work all day, I got PMS and PTA
Find the thing my kid can't find, I need a drink but there's no time
So many things I have on my list
No wonder why at times
Oh I can seem like such a witch
Why, why, why, why?

I am gonna have a come to Jesus
You can guarantee
When I walk through those pearly gates
I am gonna have a talk with Eve

I don't wanna be the one who's old before their time
And lose the wonder that I felt as a child
I can't run this race believing I might lose
There's still so much to see and so much left to do
Yes, I'll fall before I fly
But no one can say I never tried

Oh, we just get one ride around the sun
In this dream of time
It goes so fast, but one day we look back
And we ask, "Was that my life?"

I close my eyes and think how lucky I have been
To hold the ones I love and share my dreams with them
All those sunny days and all those starry skies
Good morning kisses and sweet goodnights
Oh, I can't tell them enough
Just how much that they are loved

Oh, you just get one ride around the sun
In this dream of time
It goes so fast that one day we look back
And we ask, "Was that my life?"
We just get one ride around the sun

Down South Park Boulevard
Looking good from tail to hood
Great big fins and painted steel
Man, it looked just like the Batmobile
With my old man behind the wheel
Well, you could hardly even see him in all that chrome
The man with the plan and a pocket comb
But every night it carried home
And I could hear him saying
Don't you give me no Buick
Girl, you must take my word
If there's a God up in Heaven
He's got a silver Thunderbird
You can keep your El Dorado
Man, the foreign car's absurd
Me, I wanna go down
In a silver Thunderbird
Got up every morning while I was still asleep
I remember the sound of him shuffling around
Right before the crack of dawn
Is when I heard him turn his motor on
And when I got up they were gone
Down the road in the rain and snow
The man and his machine would go
Oh, the secrets that old car would know
Sometimes I hear him saying
Don't you give me no Buick
Girl, you must take my word
If there's a God up in Heaven
He's got a silver Thunderbird
You can keep your El Dorado
Man, the foreign car's absurd
Me, I wanna go down
In a silver Thunderbird
Down the road in the rain and snow
The man and his machine would go
Oh, the secrets that old car would know
Sometimes I hear him saying
Don't you give me no Buick
Girl, you must take my word
If there's a God up in Heaven
He's got a silver Thunderbird
You can keep your El Dorado
Man, the foreign car's absurd
Me, I wanna go down
In a silver Thunderbird
Yeah, me, I wanna go down
In a silver ThunderbirdEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's not easy saying this to you
It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do
But, boy, before you go
I want you to know

I wish you strength when times are hard
Oh, I wish with all my heart you find just what you're looking for
I wish you joy, I wish you peace
And that every star you see's within your reach
And I wish you still loved me

I wish things were different, you know that
But I'm still happy for the times we had
You mean the world to me
Oh, baby, please believe

I wish you strength when times are hard
Oh, I wish with all my heart you find just what you're looking for
I wish you joy, I wish you peace
And that every star you see's within your reach
And I wish you still loved me
Losing you is tearing me apart
But a part of me will be with you, no matter where you are

I wish you strength when times are hard
Oh, I wish with all my heart you find just what you're looking for
I wish you joy, I wish you peace
And that every star you see's within your reach
And I wish you still loved me
Oh, I wish you still loved me
Mmmhmm, mmmhmmEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
