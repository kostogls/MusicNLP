Wanna get the full devotion 'cause it's taking you higher
Wanna get the most of all to gratify your desire
Wanna get the most admiration, the biggest slice
The most likes, check you out, you're a public sell out
Wanna get the full attention, please your narcissism
Wanna get the full spot to show us what you do in your kitchen
Wanna get the 24/7 full-on limelight
By giving up your private life

If you need a little love my friend
Come along I will understand
If you need a little faith, my dear
Come along I will be here
And if you need a little help that'll never end
Come along and take my hand
If you need a little love I'll be your friend

Wanna get the most of showing off by showing your stuff
Wanna get response and praise and virtual embraces
Wanna get your life judged and rated by unknown faces
Zeroed in by anonymous phrases
Wanna get control of your virtual life
Wanna get the thumb up or down for your emotional drive
Wanna get your kicks out of pics people share in reply
What's the sense, please tell me why?
If you need a little love my friend
Come along I will understand
If you need a little faith, my dear
Come along I will be here
And if you need a little help that'll never end
Come along and take my hand
If you need a little love I'll be your friend

Don't give yourself away and your personality
If someone pulls the plug you'll end up sad and lonely
On your couch in the hotspot front row
Think you're a hero and you really want the world to know
I'll be your friend, I'll be your friend, your friend
Wanna get the fame of a VIP and you're paying the price
But it's just fame in a frame till your batterie dies
Wanna get the max of clicks and you chat and you chase
But when I talk to you, you can't even look in my face
Without your device you don't know how to think
Gotta check your insta friends, 'cause you're an influenced thing
But you never get what you see when they're posing real cool
Get a life you little fool

If you need a little love my friend
Come along I will understand
If you need a little faith, my dear
Come along I will be here
And if you need a little help that'll never end
Come along and take my hand
If you need a little love I'll be your friend

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene
He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
Cause he's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

If you're feeling like a greenhorn, son gotta get a grip, the only way out is in
My gun is bigger than your gun - but a Cowboy's work is never done
I'm not tellin' no lie to anyone
And I never would cheat - but anyhow
I could use a little help from anyone
It's not so hard to do, ladies and gentlemen
There's a little John Wayne in anyone
And a bit of Django in you and me
Put a little romance in your very own world
You, you and you too take a chance
If you're feeling like a greenhorn, son gotta get a grip, the only way out is in
My truck is bigger than your truck - but a Cowboy's work is never done
Hey now, hey now now
Hey now, hey now now
Hey now, hey now now
Hey now, hey now now
Hey what a strange world, what a big mess
Somebody's gotta take care of business
Sure could use a little help from everyone
So boys and girls put your hats and your boots on
There's a little James Dean in everyone
A little Johnny Cash, a little son of a gun
Give a bit of romance in this beautiful world
You, you and you too take your chance
If you're feeling like a greenhorn, son gotta get a grip, the only way out is in
My balls are bigger than your balls - but a Cowboy's work ain't ever done

There's still a long way to go
But no go, no show, you know
Feel free, join the ride, hey everyone
Rattle that cage, break loose and let the bulls run
There's a little Clint E in everyone
A little John Doe, a little showdown
Give a little romance in this crazy world
You, you and you too take a chance
If you're feeling like a greenhorn, son gotta get a grip, the only way out is in

I broke out of jail on a dark and rainy day
The warden in my way, oh Lord, I'll make them pay
I got me a gun, stole a police car
Broke right through the gates, pedal to the floor

Away, away, on the way to my baby
Away, away, and I know, she will wait for me

Away, yeah
It's a race with the devil
The game I play, for good or for evil
Gotta follow my way, the way to my baby
Away, away - on the way to my baby
Away, away - and I know she will wait for me

In a hurry, on the flight
No place to run or hide
Robbed the bank was hard up for cash
Got myself some cocaine and hash
The whole night I felt sick and ill
Too much drugs, booze, too much pills
But I decided not to die
Cheat the devil with my evil eye



Crash the car into a gas station
Let this motherfucker burn
Jump through the plains, shouting out my baby's name
Got myself into trouble, but I won't give in
Smashed a church door, menaced the priest to take away my sins

Away, away - I will pray
Say, it will be the devil who will wait for me

(2x)
Away, yeah
It's a race with the devil
The game I play, for good or for evil
Gotta follow my way, the way to my baby
Away, away - on the way to my baby
Away, away - and I know she will wait for me

But I wake up monday with a monday blues
I look for angels far as I can see
Girl you look like heaven to me
I said you look like heaven to me

I ain't gon' stay like a lazy dog
When there's a lady on the waiting, hawk
They must be crazy, if they think I won't leave
Cause it feels like heaven to me
You feel like heaven to me

Let's go joyridin'
Staying low, friday nighting
Stay close, wait and see
I will take you high, if you're riding with me

Whiskey bottle, train your knees
Let that hair blow in the breeze
Whiskey bottle, tastes so sweet

Taking vacation from this dead-end job
I ain't as patient as I thought I was
I see you out there, waiting to break free
And you look like heaven to me
Girl you look like heaven to me

Don't need no medicine, no therapy, no pills -
Dont need no kudos, no fortune to get my thrills
I don't want no good advice, no devil in disguise -
I just need one thing to keep me alive
I don't realy care 'boute whiskey, woman of sin -
Hey, but don't get me wrong, always count me
But my personal power plant, my personal sun
Makes my motor run - It's my personal song
Goes like this
When I'm happy, when I'm blue
When I'm lonely, when I'm with you
When I'm angry, when I'm in love
When there's nothing, when there's enough
This is my song - always in my head
It makes me strong - I'm glad to have my song
I don't need no fancy clothes, champagne, big house
Don't need the VIP to make me happy
No matter if there's snow, rain moon or sunlight
My personal song makes me feel alright
So if you don't have one, find yourself your song
And keep it in your head, till the cows come home
Your personal power plant, your personal sun
Makes your motor run -
Your personal song
Goes like this
When I'm happy, when I'm blue
When I'm lonely, when I'm with you
When I'm angry, when I'm in love
When there's nothing, when there's enough
This is my song - always in my head
It makes me strong - I'm glad to have my songEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well I'm going out for my night moves, I'm ready, steady
I'm diving into the dark like a night-shark
Cowabunga - I'll teach you tonight, mh
Cowabunga - how to do it right, ah
I'll perform like a storm with devotion
Like a tornado of emotion
No I don't do sunrises anymore
Gonna stay in the dark 'cause black is beautiful
I am caught in a spell I can't be a quitter
Well I'm caught up in the rifht nifht-life glitter
Up jumps the devil and she's wearing her leather
Oh yeah, we're Adam and Evil together

Cowabunga ay caramba I like
Cowabunga ay caramba the night
It's my time to shine the sun is unsuitable
I'm gonna stay in the dark, 'cause black is beautiful
So beautiful

Oh well the only sort of light I wanna see
Is the burning flame between you and me
Cowabunga - your seduction
Cowabunga - don't need no instruction
But I'm wearing my shades so I can hardly see
Just wanna hear you and taste your smell baby
No I don't do sunrises anymore
Gonna stay in the dark 'cause black is beautiful
Cowabunga ay caramba I like
Cowabunga ay caramba the night
It's my time to shine the sun is unsuitable
I'm gonna stay in the dark, 'cause black is beautiful
So beautiful

Well I almost turn invisible
Just like a nocturnal animal
And when the darkness turns to blue my curse
Is sending me back down to the underworld
Cowabunga - I'll teach you tonight
Cowabunga - how to do it right
No I don't do sunrises anymore
Gonna stay in the dark 'cause black is beautiful

Cowabunga ay caramba I like

It's my time to shine the sun is unsuitable
I'm gonna stay in the dark, 'cause black is beautiful

In your face human race
Just how low can you go?

Well I left my mama a goodbye-note
Packed my things and hit a little road
I've put my mind into new mode
I'm gonna turn dust into gold
I'm gonna tell the world to set it straight
'Cause I really do not agree
Oh no matter in which way I look
Looks like a joke to me
Well I'm a simple guy, looking for love
And peace and harmony
And I can't see why all is going wrong
But it's wrong, that's what I see

In your face human race
Just how low can you go
In your face feel the pain
We are running down the drain

Well I called my dad to tell him all about
About my plans gonna make him real proud
I'll be back on the glory road
My ride made out of gold
Then I'll change the world into a place
Without hate, fear and pain
And all them corrupt kings, I'll bring 'em down
'Cause they're the ones to blame
And we'll live our lives full of love
In peace and without fear
And if anything will turn to wrong
Don't worry, I'll be right here
In your face human race
Just how low can you go
In your face feel the pain
We are running down the drain

I know I'm not the only one
I know I will find someone
Intentions are good but I do feel misunderstood
'Cause of me, 'cause of you, 'cause of us
There's distress more than less
Let's confess, it's a mess

In your face human race
Just how low can you go
In your face feel the pain
We are running down the drain
In your face human race
Just how low can you go
In your face feel the pain
We are running down the drainEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Wanna get your kicks out of pics people share in reply
What's the sense, please tell me why?
If you need a little love my friend
Come along I will understand
If you need a little faith, my dear
Come along I will be here
And if you need a little help that'll never end
Come along and take my hand
If you need a little love I'll be your friend

Don't give yourself away and your personality
If someone pulls the plug you'll end up sad and lonely
On your couch in the hotspot front row
Think you're a hero and you really want the world to know
I'll be your friend, I'll be your friend, your friend

Wanna get the fame of a VIP and you're paying the price
But it's just fame in a frame till your batterie dies
Wanna get the max of clicks and you chat and you chase
But when I talk to you, you can't even look in my face
Without your device you don't know how to think
Gotta check your insta friends, 'cause you're an influenced thing
But you never get what you see when they're posing real cool
Get a life you little fool
If you need a little love my friend
Come along I will understand
If you need a little faith, my dear
Come along I will be here
And if you need a little help that'll never end
Come along and take my hand
If you need a little love I'll be your friend

If you need a little love
If you need a little love
If you need a little love
If you need a little love
If you need a little love
If you need a little love
I'll be your friendEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

More, more, more, till I want no more
More, more till I want no more
I'm just a man but I'm more than you think I am (Till I want no more)
And I sure can take a lot more than you think I can (Till I want no more)
But I sure can give a lot of love, all a man can (Till I want no more)
And I'm gonna taste blood, yeah
Mmh, till I want no more
Mmh, till I want no more
If you ever think what you see is what you get
(More, more, more, till I want no more)
Baby you're wrong
And if you ever think I talk the way you want me to speak
(More, more, more, till I want no more)
Baby you're wrong
Before you judge, before you agree
(More, more, more, till I want no more)
Look twice then you might see
(More, more till I want no more)
All of the truth I'm yearning for
Uh, till I want no more
Mmh, till I want no more
I'm just a man but I'm more than you think I am (Till I want no more)
And I sure can take a lot more than you think I can (Till I want nor more)
But if you wanna burn me out girl, and my desire (Till I want no more)
I don't care no more baby so spit your fire (Till I want no more)
Mmh, till I want no more (More), till I want no more (More)
(More, more, mo-o-o-ore, till I want no more)
If you ever think your point of view
(More, more, more, till I want no more)
Is the point of view I agree to
Baby I got news for you
(More, more, more till I want no more)
You should take a walk in my shoes
From the day that I met you
(More, more, more, till I want no more)
Till today I always knew
(More, more till I want no more)
You're the one I'm yearning for
Till I want no more
Mmh, till I want no more
I'm just a man but I'm more than you think I am (Till I want no more)
And I sure can take a lot more than you think I can (Till I want no more)
But if you wanna burn me out girl, and my desire (Till I want no more)
I don't care no more baby so spit your fire (Till I want no more)
Mmh, till I want no more, I want (More), I want no (More)
I want, till I want no more, I want (More), I want no moreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Since I left I feel right
And I'm high 
Cause the more we try, the less we fly
When I close my eyes I see through your disguise

The more I give, the less I can take
The lower I feel, the higher the stakes
Today, Tomorrow, Too Long, Too Late
I'm sorry babe
Too much to blame, to low our aim
It is such a shame
The more I learn, the less I know
The higher I reach, the lower I go
Today, Tomorrow, Too Long, Too Late
I'm sorry babe
Too small the gain, too much the pain
It is such a shame

Look ahead, don't look back
Don't hesitate or turn on a one way track
Cause the more we run, the less we move on
So let go, baby, don't you think so
Cause the more you get, the less you can share
The more I could have, the less I care
Today, Tomorrow, Too Long, Too Late
I'm sorry babe
Too much in vain, to low the flame
It is such a shame
Well the more we discuss, the less we agree
The more we look, the less we can see

The more we discern, the less we're the same
The less we agree, the more we gain
The deeper our faith, the higher the wall
The harder the bang, the softer the fall

Today, Tomorrow, Too Long, Too Late
I'm sorry babe
Too small the gain, too much the pain
It is such a shame
Today, Tomorrow, Too Long, Too Late
I'm sorry babe
Too much to say, too less to play
It is so insaneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
