A farmer and a teacher, a hooker and a preacher
Riding on a midnight bus bound for Mexico
One was headed for vacation, one for higher education
And two of them were searching for lost souls
That driver never ever saw the stop sign
And eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

That farmer left a harvest, a home, and eighty acres
The faith and love for growing things in his young son's heart
And that teacher left her wisdom in the minds of lots of children
And did her best to give 'em all a better start
And that preacher whispered, "Can't you see the Promised Land?"
As he laid his blood-stained Bible in that hooker's hand

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go
That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday
As he held that blood-stained Bible up for all of us to see
He said, "Bless the farmer, and the teacher, and the preacher
Who gave this Bible to my mama, who read it to me"

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, now I guess we know
It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well I've heard those city singers singin' 'bout how they can love,
Deeper than the oceans, higher than the stars above.
Well, I come from the country, and I know I ain't seen it all
But I heard that ocean's salty, and the stars, they sometimes fall.
And that would not do justice to the way I feel for you
So I had to sing this song about all the things I knew
My love is deeper than the holler.
Stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes,
That fall in late December
And honest as a Robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill.
From the back roads to the Broadway shows with a million miles between
There's a least a million love songs that people love to sing
And every one is different, and every one's the same
And this is just another way of sayin' the same thing
My love is deeper than the holler
Stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes
That fall in late December
And honest as a Robin on a spring-time window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill
My love is deeper than the holler
Stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes
That fall in late December
And honest as a Robin on a spring-time window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill

You may think that I'm talking foolish
You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free
You may wonder how I can promise you now
This love that I feel for you, always will be
But you're not just time that I'm killing
I'm no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live, this love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die, oh, baby

I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, Amen​
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
I'll be happy to tell you again
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, Amen

They say that time takes its toll on a body
Makes the young girl's brown hair turn grey
But honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair
And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway
They say that time can play tricks on a memory
Make people forget things they knew
Well, it's easy to see it's happening to me
I've already forgotten every woman but you, oh, darling
I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, Amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
Well, just listen to how this song ends
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, Amen

I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, forever and ever
Forever and ever, Amen1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, I'm tired and so weary, but I must go along
'Til the Lord comes and calls me away
Where the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
And the night, night is as fair as the day

There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me

Well, the flowers will be blooming and the grass will be green
And the skies will be clear and serene
Where the sun ever beams in this valley of dreams
And no clouds there will ever will be seen

There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me

Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolf will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb
And the beast from the wild shall be led by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me somedayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

On one hand, I count the reasons I could stay with you
And hold you close to me all night long
So many lover's games, I'd love to play with you
On that hand, there's no reason why it's wrong

But on the other hand, there's a golden band
To remind me of someone who would not understand
On one hand, I could stay and be your lovin' man
But the reason I must go is on the other hand

In your arms, I feel the passions I thought had died
When I looked into your eyes, I found myself
And when I first kissed your lips, I felt so alive
I've got to hand it to you girl, you're somethin' else

But on the other hand, there's a golden band
To remind me of someone who would not understand
On one hand, I could stay and be your lovin' man
But the reason I must go is on the other hand
Yeah, the reason I must go is on the other handEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Last night, I dug your picture out from my old dresser drawer
I set it on the table and I talked to it 'til four
I read some old love letters right up 'til the break of dawn
Yeah, I've been sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

Then I went through the jewelry and I found our wedding rings
I put mine on my finger and I gave yours a fling
Across this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home
Yeah, tonight, I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

I'm diggin' up bones (Diggin' up bones)
I'm diggin' up bones (Diggin' up bones)
Exhumin' things that's better left alone
I'm resurrectin' memories of a love that's dead and gone
Yeah, tonight, I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

And I went through the closet and I found some things in there
Like that pretty negligee that I bought you to wear
And I recall how good you looked each time you had it on
Yeah, tonight, I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones

I'm diggin' up bones (Diggin' up bones)
I'm diggin' up bones (Diggin' up bones)
Exhumin' things that's better left alone
I'm resurrectin' memories of a love that's dead and gone
Yeah, tonight, I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones
I'm resurrectin' memories of a love that's dead and gone
Yeah, tonight, I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones (Diggin' up bones)

When he swings in the saddle, he's a real gone cat
With his Spanish spurs and his buckaroo hat
Camps in an old line shack way back in the sticks
He loves to tie 'em down and burn their hide
And there ain't no rough string he can't ride
But cuttin' a rug is how he gets his kicks

He does the cowboy boogie
The cowboy way
The cowboy boogie
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yippy yippy yay

So it's adios to his old payoose
And down the road to turn it loose
At an old dance hall he cuts that gal out straight
Spins her sideways through the herd
He's bucking like he's being spurred
Twisting and a rocking like a bronc
Coming outta the gate

He does the cowboy boogie
The cowboy way
The cowboy boogie
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yippy yippy yay

Well he swings in the saddle, he's a real gone cat
With his Spanish spurs and his buckaroo hat
A true ? walking fool, he ain't no dude
The Fred Astaire of hill and range
Two parts cool and one part strange
He's the best out west at any altitude

He does the cowboy boogie
The cowboy way
The cowboy boogie
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yippy yippy yay

He does the cowboy boogie

You can offer me a diamond-plated pearl;
You can send me all the riches in the world;
You can tempt me with the palaces of kings;
I'd give 'em back in a big ol' sack and keep the simple things
I've got the simple things; I've got the rain in spring
Got spicy chicken wings, and French-fried onion rings
You can line me up a mile of limousines;
For me it don't add up to a hill o' beans;
I got no hankerin' for grabbin' your brass ring;
It's crystal clear - I'll stay right here and keep the simple things
I've got the summer breeze, got 16 cans of peas
A two-speed window fan when it's 93 degrees
So forgive me for not grabbin' your brass ring;
It's crystal clear - I'll stay right here and keep the simple things

Suppose I called you up tonight and told you that I love you
And suppose I said I want to come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I've finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spendin' all my time alone

If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killin' me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too and would we cry together?
Or would you simply laugh at me and say

I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
And now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand?
Would we get that old-time feelin'? Would we laugh and talk for hours?
The way we did when our love first began

Would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely
And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live and love forever, and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned?
Would you say I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
But now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

Well, I lost my heart on the day we met
But I gained a lot and that I don't regret
Then I hung around 'til you said I do
I knew I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

Well, it changed my thinkin' when you changed your name
And neither one of us will ever be the same
And I swear I'm never gonna be untrue
'Cause I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

If I didn't have you I'd long ago
Been left in the dark out in the cold
Blowin' around from town to town
Like a feather in the wind
If I didn't have you I know I'd be
Flounderin' around like a ship at sea
Lost in the rain of a hurricane
And that's where I'd have been

But I didn't get lost 'cause I saw your light
Shinin' like a beacon on a cold dark night
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue
No, I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
Well, I count my blessings every night I pray
That the Lord lets me keep you just one more day
And every day He does, 'cause God knows too
That I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

If I didn't have you I'd long ago
Been left in the dark out in the cold
Blowin' around from town to town
Like a feather in the wind
If I didn't have you I know I'd be
Flounderin' around like a ship at sea
Lost in the rain of a hurricane

Everybody gathered where the river runs wider
At the edge of town
To see if that Eddie Lee Vaughn baptism
Was really gonna go down
Folks bet their hard earned money that water wouldn't change a thing
They set the odds at a hundred to one his soul wouldn't never come clean
Then the preacher said, "People take a moment or two
There's something we need to do, pray for the fish"
They won't know what's comin'
When the sin starts rolling off the like's of him
Lord, be with 'em, they ain't done nothin'
Please, won't you leave them just a little bit of room to swim?
Pray for the fish
Well, the preacher ducked 'em under
That cool clear water, then he did it again
Eddie came up yellin', "Lord in Heaven
Halleauh, I'm a brand new man"
Well, the water got to bubblin', sky got to rumblin'
And the thunder backed up the choir, the fish started jumpin'
It was like they was swimmin' in a lake of fire
Then Eddie's momma stepped out of the crowd
And started yellin' out loud, "Pray for the fish"
They won't know what's comin'
When the sin starts rollin' off the like's of him
Lord, be with em, they ain't done nothin'
Please, won't you leave them just a little bit of room to swim?
Pray for the fish
He said, "Everybody cross your fingers
Fold your hands, pray for ole' Eddie
But before we say, Amen
Pray for the fish"
Lord, be with 'em, they ain't done nothin'
Please, won't you leave them just a little bit of room to swim?

He wore starched white shirts buttoned at the neck
And he'd sit in the shade and watch the chickens peck
And his teeth were gone, but what the heck
I thought, that he walked, on water

He said he was a cowboy, when he was young
He could handle a rope, and he was good with a gun
And my mama's daddy was his oldest son
And I thought, that he walked, on water

And if the story was told, only heaven knows
But his hat seemed to me, like an old halo
And although his wings, they were never seen
I thought, that he walked, on water

Then he tied a cord, to the end of a mop
And said, "son, here's a pony, keep her at a trot"
And I'd ride in circles while he laughed a lot
Then I'd flop down beside him

And he was ninety years old in '63
And I loved him and he loved me
And lord, I cried the day he died
'Cause I thought, that he walked, on water
And if the story was told, only heaven knows
But his hat seemed to me, like an old halo
And though his wings, they were never seen

I remember how it used to feel
Riding down old two mile hill
Tennis shoes up on the handle bars
Paying no mind to the passing cars
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here
No chains, no strings, no fences, no walls
No net, just you to catch me when I fall
Look heart, no hands
It took a little time to get up to speed
To find the confidence and strength I'd need
To just let go and reach for the sky
You know sometimes it felt I could fly
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here
No chains, no strings, no fences, no walls
No net, just you to catch me when I fall
Look heart, no hands
It doesn't take much
Just a smile or a touch
And I'm a kid again
I can almost feel that wind
No chains, no strings, no fences, no walls
No net, just you to catch me when I fall
Look heart, no hands
Look heart, no handsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There is a point when you cannot walk away
When you have to stand up straight and tall and mean the word you say
There is a point you must decide, just to do it 'cause it's right
That's when you become a point of light
There is a darkness that everyone must face
It wants to take what's good and fair and lay it all to waste
And that darkness covers everything in sight
Until it meets a single point of light
All it takes is a point of light
A ray of hope in the darkest night
If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right
You will be a point of light
There are heroes, whose names we never hear
A dedicated army of quiet volunteers
Reaching out to feed the hungry, reaching out to save the land
Reaching out to help their fellow man
There are dreamers, who are making dreams come true
Taking time to to teach the children, there's nothing they can't do
Giving shelter to the homeless, giving hope to those without
Isn't that what this land's all about?
One by one, from the mountains to the sea
Points of light are calling out to you and me
All it takes is a point of light
A ray of hope in the darkest night
If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right
You will be a point of light

First we were strangers, down on our luck
And both in need of a friend
We promised each other too much, to live up to
And now, were strangers again
I came like a stranger and you took me in
And I felt at home in your arms
We had nothing but good times as long as the sun shines
But we just couldn't weather the storms
You came like a stranger and I took you in
And you gave me some reasons to live
I gave the good times and you gave the sunshine
Till we ran out of good things to give
Now we are strangers, back down on our luck
And both in need of a friend
