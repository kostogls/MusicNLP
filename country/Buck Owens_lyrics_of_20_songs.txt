Together again, my tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights are now at an end
The key to my heart you hold in your hand
And nothing else matters, we're together again


Together again, the gray skies are gone
You're back in my arms now, where you belong
The love that I knew is living again
And nothing else matters, we're together again
And nothing else matters, we're together againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh, my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street
I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat
Well, I did a double take the day I met you
My heart turned a flip as I stood next to you
And I knew right there I never could forget you
For you are my every dream come true
And my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street
I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat
You came into my life without a warning
And you turned my cloudy skies from gray to blue
You're my sunshine that comes up every morning
Yes you are my every dream come true
And my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street
I feel a trembling in my knees
And just to know you're mine until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beatEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make the film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm a gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movie's gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well, I hope you come and see me in the movie
Then I'll know that you will plainly see
Biggest fool that's ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm a gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movie's gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well, I hope you come and see me in the movie
And then I'll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturallyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
Well I'm a losing weight and a turning mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

Well I thought the day I met you, you were meek as a lamb
Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans
But now the pace we're living takes the wind from my sails
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
Well I'm a losing weight and a turning mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

Well every night you drag me where the bright lights are found
There ain't no way to slow you down
Im as 'bout as helpless as a leaf in a gale
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
Well I'm a losing weight and a turning mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tailEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Forever and ever I'll love you
I swear by the stars up above you
There never will be any other
I'll love you forever and ever
The sun may stop shining in heaven
The salty old sea may run dry
The Man in the Moon may stop smiling
Oh, but I'll always be by your side
Forever and ever I'll love you
I swear by the stars up above you
There never will be any other
I'll love you forever and ever
No other arms ever will hold me
No other lips ever will kiss me
No other heart ever will miss me
I'll love you forever and ever
Forever and ever I'll love you
I swear by the stars up above you
There never will be any other
I'll love you forever and ever
I'll love you forever and everEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My transistor radio comes from far away
And when it's night over here, over there it's-a breaking day
I remember all the good times I had walking in the sand
With a beautiful girl that I met made in Japan
The beauty of her face was beyond my wildest dreams
Like cherry blossoms blooming in the mountains in the early spring
As we walked by the river and she softly took hold of my hand
That's when I fell deep in love with a girl made in Japan
In the dark of night we would lay on Tokyo Bay
And the singing of the birds woke us up at the break of day
Her smiling eyes always seemed to try to understand
All the love in my heart for the girl made in Japan
My transistor radio comes from far away
And when it's night over here over there it's-a breaking day
She cried when she said she'd been promised to another man
That's when I left my heart with the girl made in Japan
Yes my heart will always be with the girl made in Japan1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Mirror mirror on the wall who's the saddest of them all
But I don't have to see I know it's gotta be me
Every time the wind blows at my window I rush to see if it's you at my door
And the sadness fill the rooms when you're not standin' there
And I wish that I could walk right through the floor
Mirror mirror on the wall...
Every night in dreams you torment me as I remember things I should forget
And the sun comes up by and a new day's dawnin'
But nothing's changed for I still love you yet
Mirror mirror on the wall...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I can tell by the way you hold me, darlin'
That it won't be long before it's crying time
Oh, they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well, my love for you could never grow no stronger
If I lived to be a hundred years old
Oh it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that faraway look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me, darlin'
That it won't be long before it's crying time
Oh, you say that you found someone you love better
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow
Crying time will start when you walk out the door
Oh it's crying time again...
I can tell by the way you hold me, darlin'
That it won't be long before it's crying timeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, I don't care if the sun don't shine
I don't care if the bells don't chime
Just as long as you love me
And I don't care if the tops don't spin
I don't care if the gins won't gin
Just as long as you love me
So darling, let it rain, let it snow
Let the cold north wind blow
Just as long as you love me
North or south, east or west
You know I will stand the test
Just as long as you love me
Well, I don't care if the birds don't sing
I don't care if the bells don't ring
Just as long as you love me
I don't care if the world don't turn
I don't care if the fire don't burn
Just as long as you love me
So darling, let it rain, let it snow
Let the cold north wind blow
Just as long as you love me
North or south, east or west
You know I will stand the test

I came here lookin' for somethin'
I couldn't find anywhere else
Well, I don't want to be nobody
Just want a chance to be myself
I've done a thousand miles of thumbin'
Yes, I've worn blisters on my heels
Trying to find me something better
On the streets of Bakersfield
Chorus:
You don't know me but you don't like me
You say you care less how I feel
How many of you that sit and judge me
Ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?
--- Instrumental ---
Spent some time in San Francisco
Spent a night there in the can
They threw this drunk man in my jail cell
I took fifteen dollars from that man
I left him my watch and my old house keys
I don't like folks thinking that I'd steal
Then I thanked him as he was sleeping
And I headed out for Bakersfield
Chorus:
You don't know me but you don't like me
You say you care less how I feel
How many of you that sit and judge me
Ever walked the streets of Bakersfield
How many of you that sit and judge me
Ever walked the streets of Bakersfield...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It seems like years and a million tears since you've left the old hometown
Now you've changed they say and the great white way is your new stomping ground
Well it's plain to see you've forgotten me cause you never write or call
But I'll be around when they let you down and I'll catch you when you fall
I'll catch you when you fall there's no one else but you
Now you're flying high but honey by and by you're gonna cry for love that's true
So when you're uptown baby starts giving you the stall
I'll be around when they let you down and I'll catch you when you fall
Well I've heard it said they've turned your head you're ashamed of us back home
But I'll bet the sound of a southern bound still chills you to the bone
With your haughty pose and your uptown clothes you're not fooling me at all
When you're feeling bad your ol' country lad is gonna catch you you fall
I'll catch you when you fall...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

They just don't know how lost I feel without you
My teardrops never see the light of day
I laugh and joke each time they talk about you
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it say
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
And I better say goodbye before I cry
I guess it's pride that makes me hide my sorrow
I live a lie in all I do and say
My lips may lie and paint a bright tomorrow
But if I told the truth I'd have to say
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
And I better say goodbye before I cryEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She's in some honky tonk tonight, I know
She's dancing where the music's loud and lights are low
In a crowded bar she likes to hang around
And as long as there's a honky tonk she'll never settle down
So close up the honky tonks, lock all the doors
Don't let the one I love go there anymore
Close up the honky tonks, throw away the key
And maybe the one I love will come back to me
If I had the power Id turn back time
And live again the hours when she was all mine
It hurts to see her running with that crowd in town
But as long as there's a honky tonk she'll never settle down
So close up the honky tonks, lock all the doors
Don't let the one I love go there anymore
Close up the honky tonks, throw away the key
And maybe the one I love will come back to me
Yeah, maybe the one I love will come back to me
Close up the honky tonks, lock all the doors
Don't let the one I love go there anymore
Close up the honky tonks, throw away the key
And maybe the one I love will come back to me
Close up the honky tonks, lock all the doors

Ah well, I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
Ah yes, I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy

Well a poor boy's chances for a pretty girl's glances
Are sometimes very few
Though I've got no money, if you'll be my honey
Here's what I'll offer you

Ah well, I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
Ah yes, I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy


We met by chance and I knew at a glance
That I'd found my destiny
Now I want to carry you off and marry you
If you will agree
And I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
Yes, I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Frankenstein was the first in line, And the Wolfman came up next
Dracula wasa doing his stuff- Breathing down my neck
Jump back, make tracks, here comes the Hunchback- Better get out of his way
Fee fee fi fi fo fo fum, It was a Monster's Holiday
Well, I hopped inta bed And covered up my head
Said, "I'm going to get a good night's sleep"
I got woken up About twelve o'clock And I jumped right to my feet
There was gremlins, and goblins- Dragons, and zombies
Lordy, what an awful sight
I said, "Good Buddy, you may get me, But brother, let me tell you
It's going to be after the fight."
CHORUS
Frankenstein was the first in line, And the Wolfman came up next

Uncle Bill, well, he took ill, And they sent for me to come
Well, I had to pass by the old graveyard- So I went on the run
There was screaming and moaning, waving and groaning
Scary as a mummy's curse
I said, "Good Buddy, you may get me, But brother, let me tell you
You're going to have to catch me first."

Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him
It's not the way I had him pictured, Santa was a-much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney, so mama must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him

Well, they thought I was fast a-sleepin', they thought I was tucked in bed
They never thought I'd come a-peepin' or that I'd hear what was said
Santa put his arm around mama and mama put her arm around him
So if Santa Claus ain't daddy, then I'm a-gonna tell on them

Well, Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him
It's not the way I had him pictured, Santa was a-much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney, so mama must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him

I never saw Dancer or Prancer, I never heard the sleigh bells ring
I never saw the red nosed reindeer like they show on the TV screen
But he sure brought a lot of presents, so Santa Claus, he must have been
Well, he sure looked a lot like daddy and daddy looked a lot like him

Well, Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him
It's not the way I had him pictured, Santa was a-much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney, so mama must have let him in

I don't know you from Adam
But if you're gonna play the jukebox
Please don't play A-11
Oh, please don't play A-11

I just came in here from force of habit
I don't intend to spend too much time in here
But I heard you matching for the music
And if you play A-11 there'll be tears

I don't know you from Adam
But if you're gonna play the jukebox
Please don't play A-11
Oh, please don't play A-11


This used to be our favorite spot
And when she was here it was heaven
It was here she told me that she loved me
And she always played A-11
I don't know you from Adam
But if you're gonna play the jukebox
Please don't play A-11
