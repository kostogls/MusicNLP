She put him out
Like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night

He put that bottle to his head
And pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, "I'll love her 'til I die"
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night...

She put that bottle to her head
And pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa

To the man that waited on me at the Starbucks down on Main
I hope you understand
When I put on that T-shirt, the only thing I meant to say
Is I'm a Skynyrd fan
The red flag on my chest somehow is
Like the elephant in the corner of the south
And I just walked him right in the room
Just a proud rebel son with an ol' can of worms
Lookin' like I got a lot to learn, but from my point of view

I'm just a white man coming to you from the Southland
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
We're still picking up the pieces, walking on eggshells, fighting over yesterday
And caught between Southern pride and Southern blame

They called it Reconstruction, fixed the buildings, dried some tears
We're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years
I try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin
But it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skin
'Cause I'm a white man livin' in the southland
Just like you I'm more than what you see
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
And we're still paying for our mistakes
That a bunch of folks made long before we came
And caught somewhere between southern pride and southern blame
Dear Mr. White Man, I wish you understood
What the world is really like when you're living in the hood
Just because my pants are sagging doesn't mean I'm up to no good
You should try to get to know me, I really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood
I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood
I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could
Feel like a new fangled Django, dodging invisible white hoods
So when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinking it's not all good
I guess we're both guilty of judging the cover not the book
I'd love to buy you a beer, conversate and clear the air
But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here
I'm just a white man
(If you don't judge my durag)
Comin' to you from the southland
(I won't judge your red flag)
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
(Yeah)
I'm proud of where I'm from
(If you don't judge my gold chains)
But not everything we've done
(I'll forget the iron chains)
It ain't like you and me can re-write history
(Can't re-write history baby)
Oh, Dixieland
(The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin')
I hope you understand what this is all about
(Quite frankly I'm a black Yankee
But I've been thinkin' about this lately)
I'm a son of the new south
(The past is the past, you feel me)
And I just want to make things right
(Let bygones be bygones)
Where all that's left is southern pride
(RIP Robert E. Lee
But I've gotta thank Abraham Lincoln for freeing me
Know what I mean?) It's real, it's real
It's truth18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Using a fake ID at a college bar
Getting caught with a girl in the backseat of a car
Running out on the field for the senior game wearing number 17
There's a last time for everything

Like a George Strait cassette in a Pontiac
Or telling Supercuts, "Let's leave it long in the back"
Wearing a tux in a high school gym
And she's wearing your class ring
There's a last time for everything

Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
'Cause there's a last time for everything

Throwing the ball with the first dog you ever had
Spending all day on the lake with your grandad
Watching Glenn Frey sing "Already Gone" at the Forum in LA
There's a last time for everything
Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
Cause there's a last time for everything

Kissing goodbye on her porch and driving away
Introducing her as your fiancee
Getting woke up at 5 am to see if Santa came
There's a last time for everything

Biscuits and gravy at your momma's house
(Last time for everything)
Spring break on a fold out couch
(Last time for everything)
Little Jimmy on the Opry stage
(Last time for everything)
Hearing Prince sing "Purple Rain"
(Last time for everything)
(Last time for everything)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If she was a drink
She'd be a single-barrelled Bourbon on ice
Smooth with a kick
A chill and a burn all at the same time

She's Sunday drive meets
High speed chase
She ain't just a song
She's the whole mixtape
She's so complicated
That's the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane

And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
She don't just rain she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm

I know how to make her laugh
Or blush, or mad at me
But that's okay there ain't no one more beautiful angry
And she loves just as deep
As she goes when she's down
The highs match the lows
Can't have one without the other
And I love her just the way God made her
Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane

And she destroys me in that t-shirt
And I love her so much it hurts
I never meant to fall like this
But she don't just rain she pours
That girl right there's the perfect storm

She's the girl of a lifetime
A guy like me spends his whole life
Looking for, that girl right there's the perfect storm
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
She destroys me in that t-shirt16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She's a yellow pair of running shoes
A holey pair of jeans
She looks great in cheap sunglasses
She looks great in anything
She's I want a piece of chocolate
Take me to a movie
She's I can't find a thing to wear
Now and then she's moody

She's a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land
And a good feeling knowing
She's a warm conversation
That I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad
And she's a lover when she's loving

And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
Cause she's everything to me
She's a Saturday out on the town
And a church girl on Sunday
She's a cross around her neck
And a cuss word cause it's Monday
She's a bubble bath and candles
Baby come and kiss me
She's a one glass of wine
And she's feeling kinda tipsy

She's the giver I wish I could be
And the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet
And my unborn children's mother
She's the hand that I'm holding
When I'm on my knees and praying
She's the answer to my prayer
And she's the song that I'm playing

And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
Cause she's everything to me
She's the voice I love to hear
Someday when I'm ninety
She's that wooden rocking chair
I want rocking right beside me
Everyday that passes
I only love her more
Yeah, she's the one
That I'd lay down my own life for

And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me
Yeah she's everything to me

Everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When you see a deer you see Bambi
And I see antlers up on the wall
When you see a lake you think picnics
And I see a largemouth up under that log
You're probably thinking that you're going to change me
In some ways well maybe you might
Scrub me down, dress me up, oh, but no matter what
Remember, I'm still a guy

When you see a priceless French painting
I see a drunk, naked girl
You think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy
And I'd like to give it a whirl
Well, love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of
And in a weak moment I might walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall
But remember, I'm still a guy

I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by
I can hear you now talking to your friends
Saying, "Yeah girls he's come a long way"
From dragging his knuckles and carrying a club
And building a fire in a cave
But when you say a backrub means only a backrub
Then you swat my hand when I try
Well, now, what can I say at the end of the day
Honey, I'm still a guy

And I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

These days there's dudes getting facials
Manicured, waxed and botoxed
With deep spray-on tans and creamy lotiony hands
You can't grip a tacklebox
Yeah, with all of these men lining up to get neutered
It's hip now to be feminized
But I don't highlight my hair
I've still got a pair
Yeah, honey, I'm still a guy
Oh, my eyebrows ain't plucked
There's a gun in my truck
Oh, thank God I'm still a guy7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I remember trying not to stare
The night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later
In the front porch light
Taking 45 minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet
I thought I loved you then

Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

I remember taking you back
To right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There were people around
But I didn't care
I got down on one knee right there
And once again
I thought I loved you then
Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

I can just see you
With a baby on the way
I can just see you
When your hair is turning grey
What I can't see
Is how I'm ever going to love you more
But I've said that before

And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
We'll look back someday
At this moment that we're in
And I'll look at you and say
And I thought I loved you then
And I thought I loved you then

When I'm sitting in traffic some afternoon
Or bored to death in some waiting room
I'm gonna close my eyes and picture you
Today

You keep brushing that hair back out of your eyes
It just keeps falling and so do I
Well I'm feeling like the luckiest man alive
Today

I don't know about tomorrow
But right now the whole world feels right
And the memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life

I know it won't always be like this
Life could change as quick as a kiss
It's not over yet and I already miss
Today

I don't know about tomorrow
But right now the whole world is right
And the memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life
And as the seasons change and time goes bye
When your hair is grey and so is mine
I know for sure that you're gonna be
Just as beautiful as you are to me
Today
Bring on tomorrow, I've got today
Bring on tomorrow, I've got today
Bring on tomorrow, right now the whole world is right
Bring on tomorrow

Because a memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well I love her
But I love to fish
I spend all day out on this lake
And hell is all I catch
Today she met me at the door
Said I would have to choose
If I hit that fishing hole today
She'd be packing all her things
And she'd be gone by noon

Well, I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lakeshore
And I'm sitting in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
Yeah, I'm going miss her
Oh, look there, I've got a bite!

Now there's a chance that if I hurry
I could beg her to stay
But that water's right
And the weather's perfect
No telling what I might catch today
So, I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lakeshore
And I'm sitting in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
Yeah, I'm gonna miss her
Oh, look there, another bite!

Yeah, I'm gonna miss her

When you find yourself
In some far off place
And it causes you
To rethink some things

You start to sense
That slowly you're becoming someone else
And then you find yourself
When you make new friends
In a brand new town
And you start to think
About settling down

The things that would have been lost on you
Are now clear as a bell
And you find yourself
That's when you find yourself

When you go through life
So sure of where you're heading
And you wind up lost
And it's the best thing that could have happened
'Cause sometimes when you lose your way
It's really just as well
Because you find yourself
Yeah, that's when you find yourself
When you meet the one
That you've been waiting for
And she's everything
That you wanted and more
And you look at her and you finally start
To live for someone else
And then you find yourself
That's when you find yourself

We go through life
So sure of where we're heading

If I could write a letter to me
And send it back in time to myself at seventeen
First I'd prove it's me by sayin' look under your bed
There's a Skoal can and a Playboy no one else would know you hid
And then I'd say I know it's tough
When you break up after seven months
And yeah, I know you really liked her and it just don't seem fair
But all I can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare

And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
She wasn't right for you and still you feel like there's a knife
Stickin' out of your back and you're wonderin' if you'll survive
But you'll make it through this and you'll see
You're still around to write this letter to me

At the stop sign at Tomlinson and Eighth
Always stop completely, don't just tap your brakes
And when you get a date with Bridgett, make sure the tank is full
On second thought forget it, that one turns out kinda cool
Each and every time you have a fight
Just assume you're wrong and dad is right
And you should really thank Mrs. Brinkman, she spends so much extra time
It's like she sees the diamond underneath and she's polishing you 'til you shine
And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
Tonight's the bonfire rally but you're stayin' home instead
Because if you fail Algebra, mom and dad will kill you dead
Trust me you'll squeak by and get a C
And you're still around to write this letter to me

You've got so much up ahead, you'll make new friends
You should see your kids and wife
And I'd end up sayin' have no fear
These are nowhere near the best years of your life

I guess I'll see you in the mirror, when you're a grown man
P.S.: Go hug Aunt Rita every chance you can

And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
I wish you'd study Spanish, I wish you'd take a typin' class
I wish you wouldn't worry, let it be, hey I'd say have a little faith and you'll see

I've got some big news
The bank finally came through
And I'm holding the keys to
A brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside?
It sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake

There's a place I know about
Where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl, I can hardly wait
To get a little mud on the tires

Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere
Only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires
Moonlight on a duck blind
Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine
This time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singing in the background
And more stars than you can count
On a night this clear

I tell you what we need to do
Is grab a sleeping bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck
We might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires

Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere
Only one way to get there

Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong

Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by

When death has come and taken our loved ones
It leaves our home so lonely and drear
And then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year


When we see Jesus coming in glory
When he comes down from his home in the sky
Then we shall meet him in that bright mansion
We'll understand it all by and by
Yeah we'll understand it all by and byEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

That I can make you
Put that lampshade on your head

He was nineteen

Scared and all alone
He lost a leg and a girlfriend
Before he got home

And they say all is fair in Love and War
But that ain't true, it's wrong

Give 'em a tiny little pension

Like the Ferris wheel goes around and around
Well, the trouble with up is there's always a down
First I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalk
There's heaven right here on these streets and these docks

But the sun keeps settin', the days go fast
And the sand on the beach is like an hourglass
I can just feel it all slipping away
And babe I can already say that

As long I live, whatever I do
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

Before you know it, it's all gonna stop

Be a cold wind blowin' the leaves through the air
And you won't find a tan line anywhere
Baby, I know that it ain't over yet
So let's make the most of what we have left
But it's hard living for this moment we're in and
Knowing it's all gonna end

Got your Wayfarers on and the sun in your hair
And just like the song in a seashell, you'll be stuck in my mind
Bouncing around in my head

Sitting on a bench at West Town Mall
He sat down in his overalls and asked me
You waitin' on a woman
I nodded yeah and said how 'bout you
He said son since nineteen fifty-two I've been
Waitin' on a woman

When I picked her up for our first date
I told her I'd be there at eight
And she came down the stairs at eight-thirty
She said I'm sorry that I took so long
Didn't like a thing that I tried on
But let me tell you son she sure looked pretty

Yeah she'll take her time but I don't mind
Waitin' on a woman

He said the wedding took a year to plan
You talk about an anxious man, I was nervous
Waiting on a woman
And then he nudged my arm like old men do
And said, I'll say this about the honeymoon, it was worth it
Waiting on a woman
And I don't guess we've been anywhere
She hasn't made us late I swear
Sometimes she does it just cause she can do it
Boy it's just a fact of life
It'll be the same with your young wife
Might as well go on and get used to it

She'll take her time because you don't mind
Waiting on a woman

I've read somewhere statistics show
The man's always the first to go
And that makes sense cause I know she won't be ready
So when it finally comes my time
And I get to the other side
I'll find myself a bench, if they've got any

I hope she takes her time, cause I don't mind
Waiting on a woman

Honey, take your time, cause I don't mind

To ride a drop of rain

Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down here

I'm gonna walk with my grand daddy
And he'll match me step for step
And I'll tell him how I missed him
Every minute since he left
Then I'll hug his neck
Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down here

So much pain and so much darkness
In this world we stumble through
All these questions I can't answer
So much work to do

But when I get where I'm going
And I see my maker's face
I'll stand forever in the light
Of his amazing grace
Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
Hallelujah
I will love and have no fear
When I get where I'm going
Yeah when I get where I'm going6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When a single mom goes out on a date with somebody new
It always winds up feelin' more like a job interview
My momma used to wonder if she'd ever meet someone
Who wouldn't find out about me and then turn around and run

I met the man I call my dad when I was five years old
He took my mom out to a movie and for once I got to go
A few months later I remember lyin' there in bed
I overheard him pop the question and prayed that she'd say yes

And then all of a sudden, oh, it seemed so strange to me
How we went from somethin's missin' to a family
Lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be

I met the girl that's now my wife about three years ago
We had the perfect marriage but we wanted somethin' more
Now here I stand surrounded by our family and friends
Crowded 'round the nursery window as they bring the baby in

And now all of a sudden, oh, it seems so strange to me
How we've gone from somethin's missin' to a family
Lookin' through the glass I think about the man that's standin' next to me
And I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be
And lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be

Yeah, I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be
Because he didn't have to be
You know he didn't have to be2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
