The preacher man says it's the end of time
And the Mississippi River, she's a-goin' dry
The interest is up and the stock market's down
And you only get mugged if you go downtown
I live back in the woods, you see
My woman and the kids and the dogs and me
I got a shotgun, a rifle and a 4-wheel drive
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

I can plow a field all day long
I can catch catfish from dusk 'til dawn
We make our own whiskey and our own smoke, too
Ain't too many things these old boys can't do
We grow good ol' tomatoes and homemade wine
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run
'Cause we're them old boys raised on shotguns
And we say grace and we say Ma'am
If you ain't into that we don't give a damn

We came from the West Virginia coal mines
And the Rocky Mountains and the western skies
And we can skin a buck, we can run a trotline
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive
I had a good friend in New York City
He never called me by my name, just "hillbilly"
My grandpa taught me how to live off the land
And his taught him to be a businessman
He used to send me pictures of the Broadway nights
And I'd send him some homemade wine
But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
For 43 dollars my friend lost his life
I'd love to spit some Beech-Nut in that dude's eyes
And shoot him with my old .45
'Cause a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

'Cause you can't starve us out and you can't make us run
'Cause we're them old boys raised on shotguns
And we say grace and we say Ma'am
And if you ain't into that we don't give a damn

We're from north California and south Alabam'
And little towns all around this land
And we can skin a buck, and run a trotline
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive

A country boy can survive
Country folks can survive3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Country music singers have always been a real close family
But lately, some of my kinfolks have disowned a few others and me
I guess it's because I kind of changed my direction
Lord, I guess I went and broke their family tradition

They get on me and want to know, Hank why do you drink? Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
Over and over, everybody makes my predictions
So if I get stoned, I'm just carrying on an old family tradition

I am very proud of my daddy's name
Although his kind of music and mine ain't exactly the same
Stop and think it over, put yourself in my position
If I get stoned and sing all night long, it's a family tradition

So don't ask me, Hank, why do you drink? Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
If I'm down in a honky-tonk some ole slick's trying to give me friction
I said leave me alone, I'm singing all night long, it's a family tradition

Lordy I have loved some ladies and I have loved Jim Beam
And they both tried to kill me in 1973
When that doctor asked me, "Son how'd you get in this condition?"
I said, "a-hey sawbones, I'm just carrying on an ole family tradition"
So don't ask me, Hank, why do you drink? Hank, Why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
Stop and think it over, try to put yourself in my unique position
If I get stoned and sing all night long, it's a family tradition1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hey man them ain't high heel sneakers
And they sure don't look like cowboy boots
And that ain't rock and roll you're playin'
And it sure ain't country or rhythm and blues

You're singin' a song about makin' love to your drummer
Well gay guitar pickers don't turn me on
And we don't all get into Donna Summer
Do you happen to know any ol' Hank Williams songs?

'Cause you see I'm a dinosaur
I should have died out a long time before
Have pity on a dinosaur
Hand me my hat, excuse me man, but where's the door?

Used to be, I had a lot of fun in this old hangout
We'd get stoned at the jukebox and stay out of fights
Now and then, light a little smoke in the truck out back (Aww)
Then a little old Jim Beam and we'd get right

And you know these flashin' lights sure make me dizzy
And this disco's very strange to my ears
It looks like they've turned the Longhorn into a spaceship
And I'll be leavin' just as soon as I finish this beer
'Cause you see I'm a dinosaur
Should have died out a long time before
There's a whole lot of dinosaurs
So give us our hats, excuse me man, but where's the door?

Get us our hats
Excuse me man
But where's the door?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hank let's talk about your daddy tell me how your mama loved that man
Well just break out a bottle hoss I'll tell you about the driftin' cowboy band
We won't talk about the habits just the music and the manthat's all
Now Hank if you just got to tell me did your daddy really write all them songs, did he?
That don't deserve no answer hoss let's light up and just move along
Do you think he wrote 'em about your mama or about the man who done her wrong?
You know that

Well back then they called him crazy now a days they call him a saint
Now the ones that called him crazy are still ridin' on his name

Well if he was here right now Bocephus
Would he think that we were right do you think he might?
Don't you know he would Watasha be right by our side
If we left for a show in Provo he'd be the first one on the bus and ready to ride
I just wanna go hoss
Wherever he is I hope he's happy and I hope he's doin' well, yes I do
He is 'cause he's got one arm around my mama now
How he sure did love Miss Audrey and raisin' hell
I won't ask you no more questions to the stories only Hank could tell

Well back then they called him crazy now a days they call him a saint
Most folks don't know that they fired him from the Opry
And that caused him the greatest pain
I loved to tell you about lovesick and how Miss Audrey loved that man
You know I've always loved to listen
To the stories about that driftin' cowboy band, yes man
You know when we get right down to it still the most wanted outlaws in the land
Yeah, wooEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If the South woulda won, we woulda had it made
I'd probably run for President of the Southern States
The day Elvis passed away would be our national holiday
If the South woulda won, we woulda had it made

I'd make my Supreme Court down in Texas
And we wouldn't have no killers getting off free
If they were proven guilty, then they would swing quickly
Instead of writing books and smiling on TV
We'd all learn Cajun cooking in Louisiana
And I'd put that capital back in Alabama
We'd put Florida on the right track, cause we'd take Miami back
And throw all them pushers in the slammer

Oh, if the south woulda won, we woulda had it made
I'd probably run for President of the Southern States
The day young Skynyrd died, we'd show our southern pride
If the south woulda won, we woulda had it made
"Play a little dixieland boys, ah yes"

I'd have all the whiskey made in Tennessee
And all the horses raised in those Kentucky hills
The national treasury would be in Tupelo, Mississippi
And I'd put Hank Williams picture on one hundred dollar bills
I'd have all the cars made in the Carolinas
And I'd ban all the ones made in China
I'd have every girl child sent to Georgia to learn to smile
And talk with that southern accent that drives men wild
I'd have all the fiddles made in Virginia
Cause they sure can make 'em sound so fine
I'm going up on Wolverton Mountain and see ole Clifton Clowers
And have a sip of his good ole Arkansas wine

Hey, if the South woulda won we'd a had it made
I'd probably run for President of the Southern States
When Patsy Cline passed away, that would be our national holiday
If the South woulda won, we'd a had it made, olay he hee hee
I said if the South woulda won, we would a had it made

If you fly in from Birmingham, you'll get the last gate
If you blew in from Boston, no you sure won't have to wait
And I'm learning, a little more every day
About the power of the dollar, and the people with white collars, and the good old American way

I've noticed I don't get much help, when they see my blue jeans
Some slick with a suit walks up, "Oh, can I help you please?"
Yes I'm learning, as I gain a little age
About the power of the dollar, and the people with white collars, and the good old American way

Some high society lady says, "Is your horse outside?"
"No, ma'am he's between my legs, but you're too fat to ride!"
And you're learning, a little more about my ways
And what I think about your dollar, and your white collar, and your good old American way

If you don't like my Nudie boots, I'm sorry about that
Don't make fun of my hat too, or you might get knocked flat
And you'll learn some more, if you ever pass down our way
Ahh, 'bout the folks without the dollars, and without white collars, hell they are the American wayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

All my rowdy friends have settled down
And they seem to be more into laid back songs
Nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
Everybody just wants to go back home
I myself have seen my wilder days
And I have seen my name at the top of the page
But I need to find a friend just to run around
But no one wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

And I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a lost highway
And old George Jones I'm glad to see he's finally getting straight,
And Waylon's staying home and loving Jessi more these days
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

And the hangovers hurt more then they used to
And corn bread and ice tea took the place
Of pills and ninety-proof
And it seems like none of us do things quite like we used to do
And nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
Yeah I think I know what my father meant when he sang about the "Lost Highway"
And Johnny Cash don't act like he did back in
'68
And Kris he is a movie star and he's moved off to L.A.
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

Yeah me and my rowdy friends done rowdied on down4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I've got some fond memories of San Angelo, and I've seen some beauty queens in El Paso, but the best lookin women that I've ever seen, have all been in Texas and all wearin jeans
I'm a country plowboy, not an urban cowboy, and I dont ride bulls but I have fought some men, drive a pickup truck, trust in God and luck and I live to love Texas women
I thought I'd seen beauty in faraway places, till I looked upon those Houston faces, spent Hollywood nights up in Beverly Hills, but they werent nothin like one night down in BROWNSVILLE
I'm a country plowboy, not an urban cowboy, and I dont ride bulls but I have fought some men, drive a pickup truck, trust in God and luck and I live to love Texas women
I'm a pretty fair judge of the opposite sex, and I ain't seen nothin that will touch em' yet, they may be from Waco or out in Lampassas, but one thing about it they all come from Texas
I'm a country plowboy, not an urban cowboy, and I dont ride bulls but I have fought some men, drive a pickup truck, trust in God and luck and I live to love Texas women
I'm an Oiler fan not a soccer man, and my arms are red and so is my blood, and they make it boil with that soft Texas drawl and I love em all, Texas womenEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Don tell us how it really was when you was workin' with daddy

Well in 1950 I took a little nip
Along with Mr. Williams on the way to Mississipp'
We was stacked eight deep in a Packard limousine
And we met this promoter in the town of New Orleans

Well, the man told daddy that he had what it took
And he liked the way he sang and he liked the way he shook
He said, pretty soon he'd make us all rich
And we started believin' that fat sum bitch

Now daddy told the man if you wanna make some dough
Take a little money and book me on a show
And we played them dates and we filled the places well
But, Hank, he'd done blowed the profits all to hell

'Cause he'd run through a ten and he'd run through a twenty
And he'd run through a hundred just as fast as it could go
Like a big dose of sauce to a little bitty feller
He'd spend a thousand dollars on a hundred dollar show
Hank looked at me with a funny lookin' grin
Said, "I've been to the Opry and I'm goin' back again"
We met the owner in a little office there
And a big fat fella with some artificial hair

He told Hank, he wanted half of everything he made
Or he'd have to tell Audrey 'bout some women Hank had laid
And you told daddy, he'd better get smart
Get rid of them fellas and make a new start
And he fired my ass and he fired Jerry Rivers
And he fired everybody just as hard as he could go
He fired old Cedric and he fired Sammy Pruitt
And he fired some people that he didn't even know

Well, every song he made it went to number one
Y'all was workin' like hell and you was havin' fun
We was ridin' every day and playin' every night
And every twenty minutes some of us had a fight

Now, daddy he was makin' money hand over fist
And y'all was getting' screwed but you wasn't getting kissed
Yeah, I told him to pass a little bit around
But he said he'd rather send it to his folks in Alabam'
So he fired your ass and he fired Jerry Rivers
And he fired everybody just as hard as he could go
He fired old Cedric and he fired Sammy Pruitt
And he fired some people that he didn't even know

Now the owner of the Opry, he's a-doin' pretty good
He's got a music company that they call Cedarwood
And Hank played nothin' but sold out halls
And I was pumpin' gas in greasy overalls

'Cause he fired my ass and he fired Jerry Rivers
And he fired everybody just as hard as he could go
He fired old Cedric and he fired Sammy Pruitt
And he fired some people that he didn't even know

Hank run through a fifty and he'd run through a hundred
And he'd run through a thousand just as hard as he could go
Buyin' Cadillac coots, payin' double alimony
And he fired some people that he didn't even know

Don, you know, you used to work for me one time
I sure remember that, but come to think of it you fired my ass back in 1972
Oh, well, it's a family tradition ya know?
Yep yep yep
But I kept Jerry Rivers

I've got a good woman at home
Who thinks I do no wrong
But sometimes, Lord, she just ain't always around
And you know that's when I fall
Now I can't help myself at all
And I get whiskey bent and hell bound

Play me some songs about a ramblin' man
Put a cold one in my hand
'Cause you know I love to hear those guitar sounds
Don't you play, I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry
'Cause I'll get all balled up inside
And I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound

Sure enough about closin' time
About stoned out of my mind
And I end up with some honky tonk special I found
Just as sure as the mornin sun comes
Thinking of my sweet girl at home
And I need to get whiskey bent and hell bound

Play me the songs about ramblin' man
Put old Jim Beam in my hand
'Cause you know I still love to get drunk
And hear country sounds
But don't you play, Your Cheatin' Heart
'Cause that'll tear me all apart
I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound
Yeah, old Hank's songs
Always make me feel low down1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

What is your forecast
I need a major change
I can't stand no more rain

Everything's been goin' wrong
Please, tell me it's somethin' in the ozone
Or is the atmospheric pressure just too strong
I can't ride out one more storm

'Cause I've had, too many highs and too many lows
Too many storms and tornadoes
I need some blue skies and sunshine
I need a good forecast tonight

We started the tour out in Denver Colorado
I made the first one but I did not make the second show
Cause I met this girl there that brought about quite a big change
But I OD'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name
I guess you could say that my love life would not up to part
Too many nights alone had left some permanent scars
She told me she'd love me and I told her I'd do the same
Then I OD'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name
I brought it on myself and I guess that I shouldn't complain
Doc said son you can't do anymore of that cocaine
But she made me higher than all of those expensive things
But I OD'd in Denver and wish I could remember her name
I turned to other things tryin' to make my daydreams real
But they don't take the place of the woman's face and her feels
She treated me nice and I like to find her again
But I OD'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name
I brought it on myself and I guess that I shouldn't complain
Doc said son you can't do anymore of that cocaine
But she made me higher than all of those expensive things
But I OD'd in Denver and wish I could remember her name
Kinda overdid it in Denver and I just can't remember her nameEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm just a singer, a natural-born guitar ringer
Kind of a clinger, to sad old songs
I'm not a walk-behinder, I'm a new note finder
But my name's a reminder, of a blues man that's already gone

So I started drinkin', took things that messed up my thinkin'
I was sure sinkin', when you came along
I was alone in the hot lights, not too much left in sight
But she changed all that one night, when she sang me this song

Hey baby I love you, hey baby I need you
Hey baby you ain't got to prove to me you're some kind of macho man
You've wasted so much of your life, runnin' through the dark nights
Let me shine some love light, down on the blues man

I got so sick from speedin', all the stuff they said I wasn't needin'
If I was to keep pleasin', all of my fans
I got cuffed on dirt roads, I got sued over no-shows
But she came and took all that old load, down off this blues man

Hey baby I love you too, hey baby I need you
Hey baby I do get tired, of this travelin' band
I'm 30 years old now, nights would be cold now
If you hadn't stuck it out, with this blues man
I'm 30 years old now, nights sure would be cold now
If you hadn't hung around, with this blues man3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian
Standin' over by the door
Fell in love with a Chocktaw maid
Over in the Georgia store
Kaw-Liga, ooh
Standin' there, don't never let it show
She don't ever answer, yes or no
And he always wore his Sunday feathers
And carried his old black hawk
Maiden wore her beads and braids
An hoped someday he'd talk
Kaw-Liga, ooh
Standin' there, don't never show a sign
Cause his heart is made of knotty pine
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you ain't never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you don't know what you what miss
Is it any wonder that your face is red?
Kaw-Liga, you poor old wooden head
Kaw-Liga was a lonely Indian
Never went nowhere
Heart was set on the Chocktaw maid
Wearin' the long, black hair
Kaw-Liga, ooh
Standin' there, don't never show a sign
Cause his heart was made of knotty pine
And then one day, a wealthy customer
Bought the Indian maid
Took her oh so far away
And ol' Kaw-Liga stayed
Kaw-Liga, ooh
Standin' there, as lonesome as can be
Ah, just wishin' he were still an ol' pine tree
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you just ain't never had no kissin'
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, hoss, you don't know what you're missin'
Is it any wonder, that your face is red?
Kaw-Liga, you poor, ol' wooden head

I kicked the habit, of smoking back sometime ago
And I tried the hard stuff, but I had to let all that go
But the toughest thing, I ever gave up was today
'Cause old habits like you, are hard to break
I use lifesavers, to help me get off cigarettes
But you know for your love, I ain't found no lifesavers yet
And I've gone cold Turkey, 'cause there's not even one kiss a day
And old habits like you, are hard to break
Old habits like you, are hard to break
Love with someone new, is so hard to make
I had grown so used to you, and all of your ways

All the stations up here they don't sign off with Dixie
The way they did in sweet home Alabam'
And the people here don't sip Jack Daniels whiskey
The way they do in the Tennessee mountain land
I'd always heard lots about the big apple
So I thought I'd come up here and see
But all I've seen so far is one big hassle
Wish I was camped out on the Okeechobee
If this is the promised land, I've had all I can stand
And I'm headed back below that Dixie line
No I just don't fit in, and I'll never come back again
But I'm busted here an' I got Dixie on my mind
Oh I'm stuck up here an' I got Dixie on my mind

These people never smile or say a word
They're all too busy tryin' to make an extra dime
Oh I'd love to haul 'em all down around Spartanburg
And show 'em how to raise hell in Carolin'
Oh the things you know that I miss most of all
Is the freedom of the rivers and the pines
They don't do much huntin' and fishin' up here ya know
But I have met a few squirrels and one porcupine
Well if this is the promised land, I've had all I can stand

Too many lawyers in football
Baseball's got a few
The pitcher got a
Million dollars
And the quarterback he got two
The pitcher threw his arm away
And the quarterback rurned his knee
And
This they did so they could live the American dream
Now there are some preachers on TV
With a suit and a tie and a vest
They want you to send your money to the Lord
But they give you their
Address,
Cause all of your donations are completely tax free
God Bless you all but most of all send your money
Do you really want it?
Do you really need it?
You gotta keep on grindin'
Just to try to keep it
You got no time for yourself you got more for old Jim Beam,
You're goin' crazy dreamin' the American dream
Reagan is a cuttin' the budget
Makin' the democrats scream
Says we gotta control inflation
Quit spending our
Money on everything
But this year's tax increase why it's the biggest in history,
Round and around we go, where we stop who knows the American dream
Do we really want it?
Do you really need it?
We gotta keep on grindin'

I said, give me one of them Smith & Wesson Magnum .44s
'Cause there's a man that the law let loose and justice was not done
This man, he killed my wife and my only little son

I'll never forget the way he looked all through the trial
He had a big name lawyer and he had that smirky smile
Oh, yeah, he got you off on a technicality
But you'd have to grow wings and fly to ever get away from me

'Cause I got rights, I got rights too
And this time there won't be no damn lawyers and systems to protect you
But I'm gonna read you... I'm gonna read you your rights
You got a right to know that you gonna go to hell one of these black nights

And when the trial was over he had the nerve to say that's the way it goes
I said, "Well, Hoss, you'd better get you some corks 'cause your gonna have to plug up a few holes"
Guess he thought I was talkin' just to pass away time
But he kinda looks different now on his knees beggin' for his life

Hey, I got rights, I got some rights too
And this time there won't be no damn lawyers and systems to protect you

Mr. Lincoln I wish you were here
The Republic's changed a lot in a hundred years
And I don't think it's workin' like you planned
Oh, Mr. Lincoln, we could use a hand

I just read the headlines in The Nashville News
And I wish I'd made this up but I'm afraid it's true
'Cause a man was murdered for his money in the street
He was takin' his wife to a nice place to eat
When they caught the man he did 23 months of time
He pled insanity like they do now all the time
Sir, what would you have done in 1859?
Now if you shoot someone, sir, you can get off scott-free
It's the latest thing, Mr. Lincoln, can you believe?
Now they sue the manufacturers of the guns
Ain't the law changed a lot since 1861?

Mr. Lincoln I wish you were here
'Cause things have changed a lot in a hundred years
And I don't think it's workin' out like you planned
Hey, Mr. Lincoln, we sure could use a hand

I just heard the news story on the radio
They let dangerous men out of prisons now, yes sir I'm afraid it's so
'Cause they're overcrowded, and it was only his fifth offense
Yeah, and this time he's killed someone does that make any sense?
Now, my lawyer called me about a nuisance case
'Cause everybody sues over any little thing these days
Well, at least we're right, all we gotta do is tell the truth
He said, "You're living in the past, you romantic fool"
I said, "You've got that right, I lean toward the older ways
And there's damn few backwoods lawyers left today"
Mr. Lincoln I wish you were here
