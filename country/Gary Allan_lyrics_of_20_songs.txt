Sittin' out here on the hood of this truck lookin' up
At a caramel colored sunset sky
Checkin' my watch doin' the math in my head
Counting back words to when you said goodbye
Well those runway lights are gettin' brighter

I’m just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryna figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
Right now I’m sittin' out here watching airplanes

I would've lied could've cried should've tried harder
Done anything to make you stay
I wonder what you'd do if you looked out your window
Saw me runnin' down the runway just like I was crazy
That fence is too high so am I

So I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryna figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
By now I know you're thirty thousand feet above me
But a million miles away, a million miles away
By now I know I oughta act like you don't love me
But I’m just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryna figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
Yeah, I’m just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Goodbye, bye, bye
I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Baby bye, bye, byeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
And nothing's quite the same now
I just say your name now

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't want me back
You're just the best I ever had

So you stole my world, now I'm just a phony
Remembering the girl leaves me down and lonley
Well send it in a letter
Make yourself feel better

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You dont want me back
You're just the best I ever had

And it might take some time to patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I, I run away and hide
And I might find in time that you were always right
You're always right
So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now, I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
Was it what you wanted?
Could it be I'm haunted?

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You dont want me back
You're just the best I ever had
You're just the best I ever hadEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I saw you standing in the middle of the thunder and lightning
I know you're feeling like you just can't win, but you're trying
It's hard to keep on keeping on when you're being pushed around
Don't even know which way is up
You just keep spinnin' down, 'round down

Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

So hold your head up and tell yourself
That there's something more
And walk out that door
Go find a new rose
Don't be afraid of the thorns
'Cause we all have thorns
Just put your feet up to the edge
Put your face in the wind
And when you fall back down
Keep on rememberin'

Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain
It's gonna run out of pain
It's gonna run out of sting
It's gonna leave you alone
It's gonna set you free, set you free

Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

It's gonna set you free
It's gonna run out of pain
It's gonna set you free2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There's a plane flying out of here tonight
Destination New Orleans
Boss man says my big promotion's on the line
He says that's right where I need to be
Lately I've been on the road more than I've been home
All this leaving her alone is killing me
And holding her right now has got me thinkin' more and more
This is right where I need to be

Where when I hear her I can see her
I can smell her sweet perfume
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep
Where I won't miss her I can kiss her
Anytime that I want to
Yeah that's right where I need to be
Yeah that's right where I need to be

There's a plane flying out of here tonight
With an empty first class seat
Because I've finally got all my priorities in line
And I'm right where I need to be

Where when I hear her I can see her
I can smell her sweet perfume
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep
Where I won't miss her I can kiss her
Anytime that I want to
Yeah that's right where I need to be
Yeah that's right where I need to beEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well I won't make you tell me
What I've come to understand
You're a certain kind of woman and
I'm a different kind of man
I've tried to make you love me
You've tried to find a spark of the flame that burned and
Somehow turned to smoke ring in the dark

The loneliness within me
Takes a heavy toll
Because it burns as slow as whiskey
Through an empty aching soul
And the night is like a dagger
Long and cold and sharp
As I sit here on the front steps
Blowing smoke rings in the dark

I- I- I know I must be going
Because loves already gone and
All I'm taking with me are the pieces of my heart and
All I'll leave are smoke rings in the dark

The rain falls where it wants to
Wind blows where it will
Everything on earth goes somewhere
But I swear we're standin' still
So I'm not going to wake you
I'll go easy on your heart
I'll just touch your face and drift away
Like smoke rings in the dark
I- I- I know I must be going
Because loves already gone and
All I'm taking with me are the pieces of my heart and
All I'll leave are smoke rings in the darkEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Life ain't always beautiful
Sometimes it's just plain hard
Life can knock you down, it can break your heart
Life ain't always beautiful
You think you're on your way
And it's just a dead end road at the end of the day
But the struggle makes you stronger
And the changes make you wise
And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time
No, life ain't always beautiful
Tears will fall sometimes
Life ain't always beautiful, but it's a beautiful ride
Life ain't always beautiful
Some days I miss your smile
I get tired of walkin' all these lonely miles
And I wish for just one minute
I could see your pretty face
Guess I can dream, but life don't work that way
But the struggles makes me stronger
And the changes make me wise
And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time
No, life ain't always beautiful
But I know I'll be fine
Hey, life ain't always beautiful, but its a beautiful ride
What a beautiful rideEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

No rush though I need your touch
I won't rush your heart
Until you feel on solid ground
Until your strength is found, girl

I'll fill those canyons in your soul
Like a river lead you home
And I'll walk a step behind
In the shadows so you shine
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm the one

Somebody else was here before
He treated you unkind
And broken wings need time to heal
Before a heart can fly, girl

I'll fill those canyons in your soul
Like a river lead you home
And I'll walk a step behind
In the shadows so you shine
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm the one
Trust in me and you'll find a heart so true
All I want to do is give the best of me to you
And stand beside you
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm "the one"

I'll fill those canyons in your soul
Like a river lead you home
And I'll walk a step behind
In the shadows so you shine
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm the oneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I stood there in the middle of the church of the broken people
Listened to the walking wounded tell their stories
My turn came I told 'em my name. I said this ain't my first time
Then a man started talking how the devil and the bottle was ruining my life
With last night on my breath I stood up and said...
It ain't the whiskey
It ain't the cigarettes
It ain't the stuff I smoke
It's all these things I can't forget
It ain't the hard times
It ain't the all nights
It ain't that easy
It ain't the whiskey that's killin' me
So what do you got for this empty spot inside of me?
The deep dark hole where love used to be
Before she ripped it out and ran into the arms of someone else
Y'all sit in this room and you talk like you got some kind of remedy
Well I hear what you're telling me
But I've got all the proof I need
It ain't the whiskey
It ain't the cigarettes
It ain't the stuff I smoke
It's all these things I can't forget
It ain't the hard times
It ain't the all nights
It ain't that easy
Cause it ain't the whiskey that's killin' me
I've done everything to drown this hurt inside
But I can't wash you off of my mind
It ain't the whiskey
It ain't the cigarettes
It ain't the stuff I smoke
It's all these things I can't forget
It ain't the hard times
It ain't the all nights
It ain't that easy
Cause it ain't the whiskey that's killin' me
It ain't the whiskey that's killin' me1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, I never once
Backed down from a punch
Well, I'd take it square on the chin
Well I found out fast
A bully's just that
You've got to stand up to him
So I didn't cry when I got a black eye
As bad as it hurt, I just grinned
But when tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again
Scared me to death
When you took your first steps
And I'd fall every time you fell down
Your first day of school, I cried like a fool
And I followed your school bus to town
Well I didn't cry, when Old Yeller died
At least not in front of my friends
But when tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again
Well I'm a grown man
And as strong as I am
Sometimes it's hard to believe
That one little girl, with little blonde curls
Can totally terrify me
If you were to ask
My wife would just laugh
She'd say I know all about men
How when tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again
Well I know one day, I'll give you away
And I'm gonna to stand there and smile
But when I get home, and I'm all alone
I'll sit in your room for awhile
Well I didn't cry, when Old Yeller died
At least not in front of my friends
But when tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again
When tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I sure do hope this is a long night
Cause I have never felt one so right
Each look into your eyes, I'm falling
A little more and more

Looks like we started us a fire
Wrapped up in flames of desire
With every touch, they're burning higher
Two shadows dancing on the wall

With nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

We'll fall asleep here in the moonlight
In tangled sheets, we'll be here all night
And when we wake up in the morning
We might stay like this all day

Two people meant to be together
Two lovers dreaming of forever
And it just keeps on getting better
With every tender little kiss
Nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

Two people meant to be together
Two lovers dreaming of forever
And it just keeps on getting better
With nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radioEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well this town has closed down way too early and there's nothing to do
So I'm driving around in circles and I'm thinking about you
Today I heard you got a new last name
Sure didn't know it was gonna hit me this way
And the radio just keeps on playin' all these songs about rain

Now there's all kinds of songs about babies and love that goes right
But for some unknown reason nobody wants to play them tonight
Hey I hope its sunny wherever you are
That's sure not the picture tonight in my car
And it sure ain't easing my pain all these songs like

"Rainy Night In Georgia"
"Kentucky Rain"
"Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again"
Blues eyes crying in the early morning rain
They go on and on, and there's no two the same
Oh it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain

Well I thought I was over you but I guess maybe I'm not
' Cause when I let you go looks like lonely is all that I got
Guess I'll never know what could have been
Sure ain't helping this mood that I'm in
If they're gonna keep on playin' these songs like
"Rainy Night In Georgia"
"Kentucky Rain"
"Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again"
Blues eyes crying in the early morning rain
They go on and on, and there's no two the same
Oh how I wish I could blame all these songs about rainEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You're throwing around a lot of serious accusations
Ain't too hard to tell what you're insinuating
You think I'm the one who stole her away
And if not for me she'd still be yours today
We're both men here so why play games
Why don't we call a spade a spade?

Man to man, tell me the truth, tell me
Were you ever there when she needed you?
Man to man, look me in the eye, tell me
If you really loved her, why'd you make her cry?
Man to man, well who cheated who?
You're the one to blame, tell me it ain't true
Man to man, man to man

Well, you think all your anger is justified
Me, I think, it's just your wounded pride
What did you really think she was gonna do?
She's a real woman, not a doormat for you
You want her back, but it's too late
Why don't we just cut to the chase?

Man to man, tell me the truth, tell me
Were you ever there when she needed you?
Man to man, look me in the eye, tell me
If you really loved her, why'd you make her cry?
Man to man, well who cheated who?
You're the one to blame, tell me it ain't true
Man to man
Man to man, tell me the truth, tell me
Were you ever there when she needed you?
Man to man, look me in the eye, tell me
If you really loved her, why'd you make her cry?

All the days that ended well into tomorrow
All the times I couldn't lay it on the line
This old conscience that I could never follow
I hate to say it but I wish it wasn't mine
All the broken hearts that didn't see it comin'
All the tears that should have never hit the floor
All the lookin' back but mainly all the runnin'
All these reasons I'm standin' at your door
I think I've had enough, this time I'm givin' in
Without you it's too rough, so I'm standin' here again
I finally realize, it's love that never dies
And I'm really not that tough, no I'm really not that tough
I think I've had enough
Life is gonna be a circus, rain or shine
Rides did always make me nervous
So if I'm gonna ride the Ferris wheel
I'll need your hand in mine
I've think I've had enough, this time I'm givin' in
Without you it's too rough, so I'm crawlin' back again
I've finally realize, it's love that never dies
And I'm really not that tough, no I'm really not that tough
I think I've had enough
I'm really not that tough

I was lost in trouble and strife
I heard a voice and it changed my life
Now it's a brand new day
And I ain't afraid to say
You're not alone when you're down and out
And I think you know who I'm talking about
When I don't know how I'll get through
I ask myself what would Willie do
What would Willie do, well he'd travel so far
With nothing but a song and his old guitar
And a tour bus and some semi-trucks
Thirty crew men and a little bit of luck
Well, he loves all the people, the ugly and the randy
If you don't believe me, take a look at the family
And they'll tell you that it's true
When skies are gray, what would Willie do?
Well, long ago he came unto us
His words were simple but they went right through us
And the whole world sang along
Then they didn't want to hear his songs
He was gone and we thought we'd lost him
But he grew his hair and he moved to Austin
And all of the people smiled
They came to hear him sing from miles
Like a miracle, all those rednecks and hippies
From New York City down to Mississippi
Stood together and raised a brew
Where it's all gone wrong, what would Willie do?
You know sometimes I wonder, when I ain't getting nowhere
What would old Willie do when it all gets too much to bear?
And I can see him on his lonely old tour bus
He's got his problems just like any of us
Well, he'd just take a deep breath and then he'd let it all go
And he'd take another deep breath and let it all go
And he'd take another deep breath
And he'd hold it
Ah and I bet he'd feel hungry in a way that seems strange
Yeah, hungry for all the things that he just can't change
Like the time he passed out in is own bedroom and his wife sewed him up in the sheets
And beat him with a broom and he forgave her
And you think that's rough, then the IRS came
And they took away all of his stuff
They took his golf course and his recording studio
Well, he just went out and did another show
So when it's all coming down on you
Better ask yourself, what would Willie do?
What would Willie do, well he'd take a little time
And talk to old rooster as he'd drive on down the line
And there's millions down that road
And with a word he's gonna lighten their load
He loves all the people, no matter their races
Hell, he even had a hit country song with Julio Iglesias
And that ain't easy to do
So when it's all too much, what would Willie...
When the game gets tough, what would Willie...
When they call your bluff, what would Willie do?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm gonna change my way of doin' things around here
Well, I'm turnin' over a new leaf, gonna get my self in gear
'Cause I've got a woman who's better than most and I've made a mess of her plans
Startin' today, all I'm gonna be is her man

'Cause I've been a wild catter, and a go-go-getter
Been an S.O.B. right down to the letter
I've had misadventures, I've even got pictures, I'm even more than I can stand
But startin' today, all I'm gonna be is her man

I'm gonna give it all back, 'cause all I've done is take
Well I've put her on the back burner while I was out on the make
But I've got a woman who's good enough to give me a second chance again
And startin' today, all I'm gonna be is her man

Because I've been a wild catter, and a go-go getter
Been an S.O.B. right down to the letter
I've had misadventures, I've even got pictures, I'm even more than I can stand
Startin' today, all I'm gonna be is her man

I'm a little bit late but I'm wisin' up
Now I'm takin' her by the hand
Startin' today, all I'm gonna to be is her manEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I was headed north on Highway Five
On a star-lit Sunday night
When a pick-up truck flew by me out of control
As I watched in my headlights
He swerved left then back right
He never hit the brakes
As he left the road
I found him lying in the grass
Among the steel and glass
With an empty whiskey bottle by his side
And through the blood and tears
He whispered in my ear
A few last words just before he died

Don't tell Mama I was drinking
Lord knows her soul would never rest
I can't leave this world with Mama thinking
I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath

I still think about that night
And how that young man died
And how others sometimes pay for our mistakes
The last thing on his mind
As he left this world behind
Was knowing someone else's heart would break

Single six months yesterday
Thought I ought a celebrate
So I went down to grab a couple beers
And I got so drunk I ripped my pants
I asked the bouncer for a dance
I thanked him as he threw me out
I woke up at a Waffle House
With a shiner and a wild brunette
She don't know my real name yet
Well no I ain't over you

But I'm doing my best
Every day and every night
Hanging on by a thread
That's stretched just a little too tight
If I can't find some peace of mind
I'll take what I can get
I ain't doing much good
But I'm doing my best

I decided I'd get smart
And have a long talk with my heart
At some quiet spot outside of town
So I took my best friend's Pontiac
I drove it like a maniac
Right into the reservoir
I guess we ain't best friends no more
Just my luck a cop came by
Who I beat up in junior high
He said I better have a good excuse

Some day I just might join the human race again
If I can ever find a place to show my face again
Yeah I'm doing my best

I got my halo and my horns
Lived in the dark and I've seen the light
I walk between the black and white

Do you still want all of me?

It's hard describing a heartache
All because it's a one of a kind of thing
A serious injury
And a whole lot of endless pain
If it was a storm
I'd compare to a hurricane
Oh it's even got a name

If it was a drink
It would be a strong one
If it was a sad song
It would be a long one
If it was a color
It would be a deep deep blue
But if we're talking about a heartache
It would be you

If it was a full moon
It would be a total eclipse
If it was a tidal wave
It would sink a thousand ships
If it was a blizzard
It would be a record breaking cold
If it was a lie
It would be the biggest story you've ever told
If it was a drink
It would be a strong one
If it was a sad song
It would be a long one
If it was a color
It would be a deep deep blue
But if we're talking about a heartache
It would be you

If it was a color

But if we're talking about a heartache
It would be youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
