Really raise my voice
Yeah, I wanna scream and shout
No inhibitions

The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun and...

Oh-oh-oh, go totally crazy
Forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts
Oh-oh-oh, really go wild
Yeah, doin' it in style

Oh-oh-oh, I wanna be free
Yeah, to feel the way I feel

The chance to get out on the town
We don't need romance
We only wanna dance
We're gonna let our hair hang down

When I first saw you, I saw love
And the first time you touched me, I felt love
And after all this time
You're still the one I love
Mmm, yeah

Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday

They said, “I bet they'll never make it”
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong

(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
Ain't nothing better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missing

They said, “I bet they'll never make it”
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong

Ow
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius, you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original, a know-it-all

Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're a rocket scientist

That don't impress me much
So you got the brains, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve—just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughta lock it
’Cause heaven forbid it should fall outta place
Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're Brad Pitt

That don't impress me much (Oh, oh, uuh)
So you got the looks, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Yeah

You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car good night
Come on, baby, tell me, you must be joking, right?

Oh-oh, you think you're something special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you've got a car

That don't impress me much (Oh, oh, uuh)
So you got the moves, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much (Don't impress me)
Oh, oh no, you think you're cool, but have you got the touch?
Now, now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night
That don't impress me much
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
Okay, so what do you think, you're Elvis or something?

I do swear that I'll always be there
I'd give anything and everything and I will always care
Through weakness and strength, happiness and sorrow
For better for worse, I will love you
With every beat of my heart

From this moment, life has begun
From this moment, you are the one
Right beside you is where I belong
From this moment on
From this moment, I have been blessed
I live only for your happiness
And for your love, I'd give my last breath
From this moment on

I give my hand to you with all my heart
I can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you

From this moment, as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment on
Ohh
You're the reason I believe in love
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us
My dreams came true because of you

There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment

I will love you (I will love you), as long as I live

I wasn’t just broken, I was shattered
I trusted you so much, you're all that mattered
You no longer love me and I sang like a sad bird
I couldn't move on and I think you were flattered

Oh! Life’s about joy
Life's about pain
It's all about forgiving and the will to walk away
I'm ready to be loved
And love the way I should
Life's about
Life's about to get good

Oh, life's about to get good
Oh, life's about to get good
Oh, life's about to get good

The longer my tears fell, the wider the river
It killed me that you'd give your life to be with her
I had to believe that things would get better
It was time to forget you, forever
Oh! Life’s about joy
Life's about pain
It's all about forgiving and the will to walk away

This is what a woman wants

Any man of mine better be proud of me
Even when I'm ugly, he still better love me
And I can be late for a date—that's fine
But he'd better be on time
Any man of mine'll say it fits just right
When last year's dress is just a little too tight
And anything I do or say better be okay
When I have a bad hair day

And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way!"

Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin', kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin', earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine
Well, any man of mine better disagree
When I say another woman's looking better than me
And when I cook him dinner and I burn it black
He'd better say, "Mmmm, I like it like that, yeah"

And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way!"

Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin', kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin', earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

Let me hear you say
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way!"

(Any man, any man, any man)
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin', kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin', earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine
You gotta shimmy shake
Make the earth quake
Kick, turn, stomp, stomp, then you jump
Heel to toe, do-si-do
'Til your boots wanna break
'Til your feet and your back ache
Keep it movin' 'til you just can't take anymore
Come on everybody on the floor
A-one two, a-three four
Hup two, hup
If you wanna be a man of mine, that's right
This is what a woman wants6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My pantyline shows, got a run in my hose
My hair went flat, man, I hate that (Hate that)
Oh, just when I thought things couldn't get worse
I realized I forgot my purse

Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way
Rub my feet, give me something to eat
Fix me up my favorite treat
Honey, I'm back, my neck's killing me
I need to relax and watch TV
Get off the phone, give the dog a bone
Hey (Hey)
Hey
Honey, I'm home
I broke a nail opening the mail
I cursed out loud 'cause it hurt like hell
This job's a pain; it's so mundane
It sure don't stimulate my brain

Mmm, oh

We live in a greedy little world
That teaches every little boy and girl
To earn as much as they can possibly
Then turn around and spend it foolishly
We've created us a credit card mess
We spend the money that we don't possess
Our religion is to go and blow it all
So we're shoppin' every Sunday at the mall

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

It makes you wanna sing (Ka-ching!)
It's such a beautiful thing
Ka-ching! (Ka-ching!)
Lots of diamond rings (Ka-ching!)
The happiness it brings (Ka-ching!)
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things
When you're broke, go and get a loan
Take out another mortgage on your home
Consolidate so you can afford
To go and spend some more when you get bored

It's in the way we make love
Oh, how I adore you
Like no one before you
I love you just the way you are

It's in the way you want me
Oh, it's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love

It's just the way you areEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Don't close the door when you leave
It's cold out
I need to see the air when you breathe
And say out loud
That you'll be home soon
Not to worry
You're gonna hurry back

Has anybody seen my soldier
Standing all alone?
Has anybody seen my soldier
Just tryna get home?

You're not alone when you dream
I'm with you
I hear your heart when it beats
I feel it too
Sleep in peace
Love is tender
Please remember me

Has anybody seen my soldier
Standing all alone?
Has anybody seen my soldier
Just tryna get home?
Where did you go, my love? (I need to know)
I need to know you're safe (So many miles)
So many miles between us
I need to see your face

Has anybody seen my soldier
Standing all alone?
Has anybody seen my soldier?
Oh, has anybody seen my soldier
Standing all alone?
Has anybody seen my soldier
Just tryna get home?
Just tryna get homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Am I dreaming or stupid?
I think I've been hit by cupid
But no one needs to know right now
I met a tall, dark and handsome man
And I've been busy making big plans
But no one needs to know right now
I got my heart set, my feet wet
But he don't even know it yet
And no one needs to know right now

I'll tell him someday, some way, somehow
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now

I want bells to ring, a choir to sing
The white dress, the guests, the cake, the car, the whole darn thing
But no one needs to know right now

I'll tell him someday, some way, somehow
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now

We'll have a little girl, a little boy
A little Benji we call Leroy
But no one needs to know right now
And I'm not lonely anymore at night
And he don't know only, only he can make it right
And I'm not lonely anymore at night
And he don't know only, only he can make it right

I'm not dreaming or stupid
But boy, have I been hit by cupid
But no one needs to know right now
No one needs to know right now
No one needs to know right now

There's your record Hoggs
Yup, there you go dudesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Whose bed have your boots been under?
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
But whose bed have your boots been under?

Don't look so lonely
Don't act so blue
I know I'm not the only
Girl you run to
I know about Lolita
Your little Spanish flame
I've seen you around with Rita
The redhead down the lane

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?
I heard you've been sneaking
Around with Jill
And what about that weekend
With Beverly Hill
And I've seen you walking
With long-legs Louise
And you weren't just talking
Last night with Denise

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?

Come on, boots
Oh yeah (Come on)
So next time you're lonely
Don't call on me
Try the operator
Maybe she'll be free
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder?
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?

I wanna know whose bed, baby
Whoa baby
Tell me
Whose bed
Yes, I wanna know
You better start talking
Or you better start walking1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My love, there's only you in my life
The only thing that's right
My first love
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make
And I, I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do
And your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
They tell me how much you care
Oh, yes you will always be
My endless love

Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
Forever
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms
And love, oh love, oh love
I'll be a fool, for you I'm sure
You know I don't mind (Oh)
You know I don't mind
'Cause you, you mean the world to me (Oh)
I know I know
I've found, I've found in you
My endless love
Oh, and love oh, love
I'll be that fool for you I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh you know I don't mind
And, yes
You'll be the only one
'Cause no one can deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love, my love, my love
My endless loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
