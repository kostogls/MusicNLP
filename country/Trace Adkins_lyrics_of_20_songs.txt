Turn it up some
Alright boys, this is her favorite song
You know that right
So, if we play it good and loud
She might get up and dance again
Ohh, she put her beer down
Here she comes
Here she comes
Left, left, left right left
Whoo

Hustlers shootin' eight ball
Throwin' darts at the wall
Feelin' damn near ten feet tall
Here she comes, Lord help us all
Ol' T.W.'s girlfriend done slapped him out his chair
Poor ole boy, it ain't his fault
It's so hard not to stare

At that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm, make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee, shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on
That honky tonk badonkadonk
(Aww son)
Now Honey, you can't blame her
For what her mama gave her
It ain't right to hate her
For workin' that money-maker
Band shuts down at two
But we're hangin' out till three
We hate to see her go
But love to watch her leave

With that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm
Make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on
With that honky tonk badonkadonk
(Ooh, that's what I'm talkin' bout right there, honey)

We don't care about the drinkin'
Barely listen to the band
Our hands, they start a shakin'
When she gets the urge to dance
Drivin' everybody crazy
You think you fell in love
Boys, you better keep your distance
You can look but you can't touch
That honkey tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm
Make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee, shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on
That honky tonk badonkadonk

That honky tonk badonkadonk
Yeah, that honky tonk badonkadonk
(That honky tonk badonkadonk)
That's it, right there boys, that's why we do what we do
It ain't for the money, it ain't for the glory, it ain't for the free whiskey
(That honky tonk badonkadonk)
It's for the badonkadonk

She was staring out the window, of that SUV
Complaining, saying, I can't wait to turn 18
She said, I'll make my own money, and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school
And she kissed her head and said, I was just like you

You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this

Before she knows it she's a brand new bride
In her one-bedroom apartment, and her daddy stops by
He tells her, it's a nice place
She says, it'll do for now
Starts talking about babies, and buying a house
Daddy shakes his head, and says, baby, just slow down

Cause you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this
Five years later, there's a plumber working on the water heater
Dog's barking, phone's ringing
One kid's crying, one kid's screaming
She keeps apologizing
He says, they don't bother me
I've got two babies of my own
One's 36, one's 23
Heh... It's hard to believe, but

But you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this
You're gonna miss this
Yeah, you're gonna miss this5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I told you I'd leave a light on
In case you ever wanted to come back home
You smiled and said you appreciate the gesture
I took your every word to heart
'Cause I can't stand us bein' apart
And just to show how much I really miss you

Every light in the house is on
The backyard's bright as the crack of dawn
The front walk looks like runway lights
It's kinda like noon in the dead of night
Every light in the house is on
Just in case you ever do get tired of bein' gone
Every light in the house is on

If I should ever start forgettin'
I'll turn the lights off one by one
So you can see that I agree, it's over
But until then I want you to know
If you look south you'll see a glow
That's me waitin' at home each night to hold ya

Every light in the house is on
The backyard's bright as the crack of dawn
The front walk looks like runway lights
It's kinda like noon in the dead of night
Every light in the house is on
Just in case you ever do get tired of bein' gone
Oh, every light in the house is on
The backyard's bright as the crack of dawn
The front walk looks like runway lights
It's kinda like noon in the dead of night
Every light in the house is on
Just in case you ever do get tired of bein' gone
Every light in the house is on1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

This is for all you sophisticated ladies out there

She grew up in the city in a little subdivision
Her daddy wore a tie, mama never fried a chicken
Ballet, straight-As, most likely to succeed
They bought her a car after graduation
Sent her down South for some higher education
Put her on the fast track to a Law Degree
Now she's coming home to visit
Holding the hand of a wild-eyed boy
With a farmers tan

Shes riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Charlie Daniels, yelling, Turn it up!
They raised her up a lady, but there's one thing
They couldn't avoid
Ladies love country boys

You know mamas and daddies want better for their daughters
Hope they'll settle down with a doctor or a lawyer
And their uptown, ball gown, hand-me-down royalty
They never understand why their princess falls
For some camouflage britches and a southern-boy-drawl
She's riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Hank Jr., yelling, turn it up
They raised her up a lady, but there's one thing
They couldn't avoid, ladies love country boys

You can train them, you can try to teach them
Right from wrong but its still going to turn them on

She's riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Lynyrd Skynyrd, yelling, turn it up
They raised her up a lady, but there's one thing
They couldn't avoid, ladies love country boys

They love us country boysEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I’m lost in her there holding that pink rod and reel
She’s doing almost everything but sitting still
Talking about her ballet shoes and training wheels
And her kittens
And she thinks we’re just fishin'

I say, “Daddy loves you, baby” one more time
She says, “I know. I think I got a bite.”
And all this laughing, crying, smiling dying here inside’s
What I call, livin'

And she thinks we’re just fishin' on the riverside
Throwin' back what we could fry
Drownin' worms and killing time
Nothing too ambitious
She ain't even thinkin' about
What’s really goin' on right now
But I guarantee this memory’s a big’in
And she thinks we’re just fishin’

She’s already pretty, like her mama is
Going to drive the boys all crazy
Give her daddy fits
And I better do this every chance I get
Because time is tickin'
Yeah it is
And she thinks we’re just fishin' on the riverside
Throwin' back what we could fry
Drownin' worms and killing time
Nothing too ambitious
She ain't even thinkin' about
What’s really goin' on right now
But I guarantee this memory’s a big’in
And she thinks we’re just fishin'

She ain’t even thinkin' about
What’s really goin' on right now
But I guarantee this memory’s a big’in
And she thinks we’re just fishin'
Yeah, aww, she thinks we’re just fishin'
We ain’t only fishin'

I was there in the winter of '64
When we camped in the ice at Nashville's doors
Three hundred miles our trail had lead
We barely had time to bury our dead
When the Yankees charged and the colors fell
Overton Hill was a living hell
When we called retreat it was almost dark
I died with a grapeshot in my heart

Say a prayer for peace
For every fallen son
Set my spirit free
Let me lay down my gun
Sweet mother Mary I'm so tired
But I can't come home until the last shot's fired

In June of 1944
I waded in the blood of Omaha's shores
Twenty-one and scared to death
My heart pounding in my chest
I almost made the first seawall
When my friends turned and saw me fall
I still smell the smoke, I can taste the mud
As I lay there dying from a loss of blood
Say a prayer for peace
For every fallen son
Set my spirit free
Let me lay down my gun
Sweet mother Mary I'm so tired
But I can't come home until the last shot's fired

I'm in the fields of Vietnam
The mountains of Afghanistan
And I'm still hoping, waiting, praying
I did not die in vain

Say a prayer for peace
For every fallen son
Set my spirit free
Let me lay down my gun
Sweet mother Mary I'm so tired
But I can't come home until the last shot's fired

Say a prayer for peace (For peace)
For our daughters and our sons
Set our spirits free (Set us free)
Let us lay down our guns
Sweet mother Mary, we're so tired
But we can't come home (No we can't come home)
Until the last shot's fired2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I don’t go all in but I’ll take a gamble
And I don’t burn both ends of the candle anymore
I take the corners, slower and steady
This chip on my shoulder, it ain’t so heavy anymore

We still fly like gypsies, just a little closer to the ground
We still love our whiskey, but now it’s just a little watered down

Couple girls I could’ve married, I married someone else
These torches I still carry don’t burn like hell the way they used to
The back side of 40 ain’t near as crazy
And Sunday morning ain’t near as hazy anymore

We still fly like gypsies, just a little closer to the ground
We still love our whiskey, but now it’s just a little watered down

Those old ghosts still chase me
But feels like they’re losing ground
Yeah I’m still crazy
But now I’m just a little watered downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I never thought that this is where I'd settle down
I thought I'd die an old man back in my hometown
They gave me this plot of land, me and some other men
For a job well done

There's a big white house sits on a hill just up the road
The man inside, he cried the day they brought me home
They folded up a flag and told my mom and dad
We're proud of your son

And I'm proud to be on this peaceful piece of property
I'm on sacred ground and I'm in the best of company
I'm thankful for those thankful for the things I've done
I can rest in peace, I'm one of the chosen ones, I made it to Arlington

I remember Daddy brought me here when I was eight
We searched all day to find out where my granddad lay
And when we finally found that cross
He said, "Son, this is what it costs to keep us free"

Now here I am a thousand stones away from him
He recognized me on the first day I came in
And it gave me a chill when he clicked his heels
And saluted me
And I'm proud to be on this peaceful piece of property
I'm on sacred ground and I'm in the best of company
And I'm thankful for those thankful for the things I've done
I can rest in peace, I'm one of the chosen ones, I made it to Arlington

And every time I hear, twenty-one guns
I know they brought another hero home, to us

We're thankful for those thankful for the things we've done
We can rest in peace, 'cause we are the chosen ones
We made it to Arlington
Yeah, dust to dust, don't cry for us
We made it to ArlingtonEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

He sat in that long line of barber chairs
And the Sergeant asked him, "Son, would you like to keep your hair?"
He said, "Yes, sir," as he heard those clippers buzz and hum
The sergeant said, "Well hold out your hands, 'cause here it comes"

Semper Fi, do or die
So gung ho, to go and pay the price
Here's to Leathernecks, Devil Dogs, and Jarheads
And Parris Island in July, Semper Fi

I sleep in my bed instead of a foxhole
I've never heard my boss tell me to lock 'n load
Ain't no bullet holes in the side of my SUV
Because the kid next door just shipped out overseas

Semper Fi, do or die
So gung ho, to go and pay the price
Here's to Leathernecks, Devil Dogs, and Jarheads
And Parris Island in July, Semper Fi

For the few that wear the dress blues
With hair cut high and tight
Who are proud to be the first ones in the fight
Semper Fi
Semper Fi, do or die
So gung ho, to go and pay the price
Here's to Leathernecks, Devil Dogs, and Jarheads
And Parris Island in July
Never leave a man behind

Mudgrips, white-tip, cigar stickin' out of my face
Earnhardt racin' sticker, on the window, banged up fender
4x4, straight-pipe roar, primer and rust all over the door
Scarred up knuckles, Mack belt buckle, white t-shirt, ain't afraid to work
Got a "what-are-you-lookin'-at-asshole?" smirk

Cold beer, hot wings, wranglers, Skoal ring
Get just what you see
Gun rack, ball cap, don't take no crap
Ain't a pretty boy-toy, I'll rock you steady
Rough and ready

Work boots, one blue suit, size too small, won't wear it at all
Unless somebody kicks, gets hitched, that's a bitch, it makes me itch
Up with sun, off on the run, makin' money, money, 'cause I wanna have fun
5 o'clock whistle, off like a missile, got a hot date, girl named Kate
Thinks I'm cool, 'cause I shoot straight, ain't one thing about her fake
She's long and tall, and she goes great with

Cold beer, hot wings, wranglers, Skoal ring
Get just what you see
Gun rack, ball cap, don't take no crap
Ain't a pretty boy-toy, I'll rock you steady
Rough and ready
Rough and ready
Well you are who you are
And that's all right with me
Well I am who I am
And that's all I can be, I like...

Turn it up some
Alright boys, this is her favorite song
You know that right
So, if we play it good and loud
She might get up and dance again
Ooh, she put her beer down
Here she comes, here she comes
Left, left, left, right, left
Whoo!
Hustlers shooting eight-ball
Throwing darts at the wall
Feeling damn near 10 ft. tall
Here she comes, Lord help us all
Old T.W.'s girlfriend done slapped him out of his chair
Poor old boy, it isn't his fault
It's so hard not to stare

At that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keeping perfect rhythm
Make you want to swing along
Got it going on
Like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee
Shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There ought to be a law
Get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how's she even get them britches on
That honky tonk badonkadonk

Now Honey, you can't blame her
For what her mama gave her
You ain't got to hate her
For working that money-maker
Band shuts down at two
But we're hanging out till three
We hate to see her go
But love to watch her leave

Keeping perfect rhythm
Make you want to swing along

Barely listen to the band
Our hands, they start a shaking
When she gets the urge to dance
Driving everybody crazy
You think you fell in love
Boys, you better keep your distance
You can look but you can't touch
At that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keeping perfect rhythm
Make you want to swing along

So stay with me baby and hold me all night long
Show me, show me everything you do

This gettin' up early, pullin' double shifts
Gonna make an old man of me long before I ever get rich
But I'm tryin'
It's been two years since we've finalized
I still ain't used to puttin' ex, in front of wife
But I'm tryin'

Send more money right away is pretty much all she has to say
When she calls these days, and don't you be late

But all I can do, is all I can do
And I keep on tryin'
And all I can be, is all I can be
And I keep on tryin'

But there's always a mountain in front of me
Seems I'm always climbin' and fallin' and climbin'
But I keep on tryin'

I remember daddy sayin' keep your eye on the ball
Run like hell, play to win, get up when you fall
I'm tryin'
Don't say nothin' that you can't take back
Never do anything you might regret, no don't do that
Daddy, I'm tryin'
Know the difference between heaven and hell
Go easy on the bottle, be hard on yourself
And I know he meant well

But all I can do, is all I can do
And I keep on tryin'
And all I can be, is all I can be
And I keep on tryin'

But there's always a mountain in front of me
Seems I'm always climbin' and fallin' and climbin'
But I keep on tryin'
I keep on tryin'

But all I can do, is all I can do
And I keep on tryin'
And all I can be, well that's all I can be
And I keep on tryin'
All I can do, is all I can do
But I keep on tryin'

But there's always a mountain in front of me
Seems I'm always climbin' and stumblin' and then fallin' and then climbin'
But I keep on tryin'
This gettin' up early, pullin' double shifts
Gonna make an old man of me long before I ever get rich

When the stars line up
And you catch a good break
People think you're lucky
But you'll know its grace
It can happen so fast
Or a moment late
Timing is everything
Know I've had close calls
When it could have been me
I was young when I learned
Just how fragile life could be
I lost friends of mine
I guess it wasn't my time
Timing is everything

I could have been a child that god took home
I would have been one more unfinished song
When it seems a rhyme hard to find
That's when one comes along just in time

Well I remember that day
When our eyes first met
You ran into the building to get out of the rain
Because you were soaking wet
And as I held the door
You wanted to know my name
Timing is everything
I could have been another minute late
You never would've crossed my path that day
When it seems true love is hard to find
That's when love comes along just in time
You can call it fate or destiny
Sometimes it's real it
Seems like it's a mystery
You can be hurt by love
Or healed by the same
Timing is everything

And it can happen so fast
Or a little bit late
Timing is everythingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Keep it on the slow and steady, Mr. Dependable

But girl with you, I'm Jekyll and Hyde

And you nibble on my neck
I can't be held responsible

No telling what I'll do

Make me want to rob a bank
And make love in the pile of money
Don't try to act all
Innocent and sweet
Because you know exactly what it is you do to me

No telling what I'll do

Every now and then you got to take it on the chin
Got to turn the other cheek
But then there's times your old stubborn pride
Don't back down so easily
And you got no choice but to let your voice
Be heard and hold your ground
And that's the point that he'll get the point
And he'll probably back down
But if he bows up and steps across that line
You got to whoop a man's ass sometimes

Man, I'll be the first one here to call you crazy
If you let me catch you cussing at a kid or roughing up a lady
And God forbid that anybody mess with mine
You got to whoop a man's ass sometimes

Yeah, I let it slide when the liquored up guy
Asked me, "Boy, what you looking at?"
And I kept my cool when the reckless fool
Put a dent in my Cadillac
And I don't care if my long hair
Draws stares the way it does
Long as you ain't throwing sticks and stones
You'd probably be alright 'cause
I'll take the high road if I can out of a bind
But you gotta whoop a man's ass sometimes
Man, I'll be the first one here to call you crazy

A year-old truck and a nine to five
Comes home at night to a pretty wife
With a baby due
He'll sleep in on Saturday
Cut the grass if it don't rain
After church he'll watch the game and have a beer or two
He'll stand up when he hears the anthem
And that won't ever change

He's still a soldier
His blood runs red, white, and blue
He put away his gun and boots
But he still believes the American dream
'Til his last breath he'll always be a soldier
He's still a soldier

He's on his couch for the news at ten
He'll see those places that he's been
And when a brother falls there's a part of him that does too
And if they called and needed him back
Oh, he'd be on that plane
He's still a soldier
His blood runs red, white, and blue
He put away his gun and boots
But he still believes the American dream
'Til his last breath he'll always be a soldier
He's still a soldier

He don't wake up anymore
When he hears thunder
Oh, but even if he lives to be a hundred
He'll still be a soldier

He's still a soldier
His blood runs red, white, and blue
He put away his gun and boots
But he still believes the American dream
'Til his last breath he'll always be a soldier
He's still a soldier
He's still a soldierEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You're doin' all you can, to get in them old jeans
You want that body back, you had at seventeen
Well, baby, don't get down, don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause the way you fill 'em out, hey, that's alright with me

I don't want the girl you used to be
An' if you ain't noticed, the kids are fast asleep, and you're...

One hot mama
You turn me on, let's turn it up, and turn this room into a sauna
One hot mama
Oh, what do you say, babe? You wanna?

Well, I know sometimes you think, that all you really are
Is the woman with the kids, and the groceries in the car
And you worry about your hips, and you worry about your age
Meanwhile I'm tryin' to catch, the breath you take away

Oh, an' believe me, you still do
Baby, all I see, when I look at you, is...
One hot mama
You turn me on, let's turn it up, and turn this room into a sauna
One hot mama
Oh, what do you say, babe? You wanna?

I can't imagine me lovin' someone else
I'm a lucky man, I think Daddy's got himself

One hot mama
You turn me on, let's turn it up, and turn this room into a sauna
One hot mama
Oh, what do you say, babe?
Oh, now what do you say, babe? You wanna?

You're one hot mama
Let's turn this room into a sauna, yeah
What do you say, babe?
What do you say, babe?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
