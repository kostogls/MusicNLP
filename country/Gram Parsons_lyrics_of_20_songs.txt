Won't you scratch my itch sweet Annie Rich
And welcome me back to town
Come out on your porch or  step into your parlour
And I'll tell you how it all went down
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
And I remembered something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all led me straight back home to you
Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with the waves of grain
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee
We flew straight across that river bridge, last night half past two
The switch-man wave his lantern goodbye and good day as we went roling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do
And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something that I've never been shown
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue see
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee
The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
And lighted out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
And I remembered something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all led me straight back home to you
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all led me straight back home to you3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In South Carolina there are many tall pines
I remember the oak tree that we used to climb
But now when I'm lonesome, I always pretend
That I'm getting the feel of hickory wind
I started out younger at most everything
All the riches and pleasures, what else could life bring?
But it makes me feel better each time it begins
Callin' me home, hickory wind
It's a hard way to find out that trouble is real
In a far away city, with a far away feel
But it makes me feel better each time it begins
Callin' me home, hickory wind
Keeps callin' me home, hickory windEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She
She came from the land of the cotton
A land that was nearly forgotten by everyone
She
She worked and she slaved so hard
A big old field was her back yard in the delta sun

Oh, but she sure could sing
Oh, she sure could sing

Then he
Looked down and he took a little pity
The whole town swore he decided he'd help her some
But he
Didn't mind if she wasn't very pretty
And deep inside his heart, he knew she was the only one

Oh, but she sure could sing
Yeah, she sure could sing

She had faith, she had believing
She led all the people together in singing
And she prays every night to the Lord up above
Singing hallelujah, hallelujah
They
Used to walk, singing songs by the river
Even when she knew for sure she had to go away
She
Never knew what her life was to give her
And never had to worry about it for one single day

Oh my, but she sure could sing
Oh, she sure could sing

She had faith, she had believing
She led all the people together in singing
And she prays every night to the Lord up above
Singing hallelujah, hallelujah

She
She came from the land of the cotton
A land that was nearly forgotten by everyone
She
She worked and she slaved so hard
A big old field was her back yard in the delta sun
Oh yes, she sure could sing
My, my, my, she sure could sing
Oh yeah, she sure could sing
Oh, and she sure could singEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh, my land is like a wild goose
Wanders all around, everywhere
Trembles and it shakes 'til every tree is loose
It rolls the meadows, and it rolls the nails

So take me down to your dance floor
And I won't mind people when they stare
Paint a different color on your front door
And tomorrow, we will still be there

Jesus built a ship to sing a song to
It sails the river, and it sails the tide
Some of my friends don't know who they belong to
Some can't get a single thing to work inside

So take me down to your dance floor
And I won't mind the people when they stare
Paint a different color on your front door
And tomorrow, we will still be there

I've loved you every day, and now I'm leaving
And I can see the sorrow in your eyes
I hope you know a lot more than you're believing
Just so the sun don't hurt you when you cry

Oh, take me down to your dance floor
I wonÂ´t mind the people when they stare
Paint a different color on your front door
And tomorrow, we may still be there
And tomorrow, we may still be thereEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In my hour of darkness
In my time of need
Oh, Lord grant me vision
Oh, Lord grant me speed
Once I knew a young man
Went driving through the night
Miles and miles without a word
With just his high-beam lights
Who'd have ever though they'd build such
A deadly Denver bend
To be so strong, to take as long as
It would till the end
In my hour of darkness
In my time of need
Oh, Lord grant me vision
Oh, Lord grant me speed
Another young man safely strummed his
Silver string guitar
And he played to people everywhere
Some say he was a star
But he was just a country boy
His simple songs confess
And the music he had in him
So very few possess
In my hour of darkness
In my time of need
Oh, Lord grant me vision
Oh, Lord grant me speed
Then there was an old man
Kind and wise with age
And he read me just like a book and he
Never missed a page
And I loved him like my father
And I loved him like my friend
And I knew his time would shortly come
But I did not know just when
In my hour of darkness
In my time of need
Oh, Lord grant me vision
Oh, Lord grant me speed
Oh, Lord grant me vision
Oh, Lord grant me speedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Love hurts, love scars
Love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough
Nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain
Take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain
Love hurts
Mmm-mm, love hurts
I'm young, I know
But even so
I know a thing or two
I've learned from you
I've really learned a lot
Really learned a lot
Love is like a stove
Burns you when it's hot
Love hurts
Mmm-mm, love hurts
Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves, I guess
But they're not fooling me
I know it isn't true
Know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts
Mmm-mm, love hurts
Love hurts
Mmm-mm, love hurts
Oh-oh, love hurts1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We know it's wrong to let this fire burn between us
We've got to stop this wild desire in you and in me
So we'll let the flame burn once again until the thrill is gone
Then we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning
We're two people caught up in the flame that has to die out soon
I didn't mean to start this fire and neither did you
So tonight when you hold me tight we'll let the fire burn on
And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning
Each time when we meet we both agree that it's for the last time
But out of your arms I'm out of my mind
So we'll taste the thrill of stolen love tonight until the dawning
And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning
We're two people caught up in the flame that has to die out soon
I didn't mean to start this fire and neither did you
So tonight when you hold me tight we'll let the fire burn on
And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning
Yes we'll taste the thrill of stolen love tonight until the dawning
And we'll sweep out the ashes
We'll sweep out the ashes
We'll sweep out the ashes in the morning

Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes
Warm evenings, pale mornings, bottled blues
And the tiny golden pins that she wore up in her hair
Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes
My mind was young until she grew
My secret thoughts known only by the few
It was a dream much to real to be leaned against too long
All the time I think she knew
Her words still dance inside my head
Her comb still lies beside my bed
And the sun comes up without her, it just doesn't know she's gone
Oh, but I remember everything she said
Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes
Warm evenings, pale mornings, bottled blues
And the tiny golden pins that she wore up in her hair
Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Was a thousand dollar wedding
Supposed to be held, the other day
And with all the invitations sent
The young bride went away
When the groom saw people passing notes
'Not unusual,' he might say
'But where are the flowers for my baby?
I'd even like to see her mean old mama
And why ain't there a funeral, if you're gonna act that way?'

I hate to tell you how he acted when the news arrived
He took some friends out drinking and it's lucky they survived
Well, he told them everything there was to tell there along the way
And he felt so bad when he saw the traces
Of old lies still on their faces
So why don't someone here just spike his drink
Why don't you do him in some old way

Supposed to be a funeral, it's been a bad, bad day

The Reverend Dr. William Grace was talking to the crowd
All about the sweet child's holy face
And the saints who sung out loud
And he swore the fiercest beasts
Could all be put to sleep the same silly way
And where are the flowers for the girl
She only knew she loved the world
And why ain't there one lonely horn and one sad note to play?
Supposed to be a funeral, it's been a bad, bad day
Supposed to be a funeral, it's been a bad, bad dayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well I sold the farm to take my woman where she used to be
We left our kin and all our friends back there in Tennessee
And I bought those one way tickets she had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore
Well her heart was filled with gladness when she saw those city lights
She said the prettiest place on earth was Baltimore at night
Well a man feels proud to give his woman what she's longing for
And I kinda liked the streets of Baltimore
Hen I got myself a factory job, I ran an old machine
And I bought a little cottage in a neighborhood serene
And every night when I'd come home with every muscle sore
She'd drag me through the streets of Baltimore
Well I did my best to bring her back to what she used to be
Then I soon learned she loved those bright lights more than she loved me
Now I'm a going back on that same train that brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
While my baby walks the streets of BaltimoreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You say that you're restless, you say that you know me too well
You've seen all my best and you've heard all the stories I tell
You think you've been taken for granted, you're probably right
Stil I remember a November Night
When the dawn on your doorway shone white with frost
And the soft love that always began with the touch of your hand
And recall the mornings that tossed your hair in the wind
Time's made it meaningless, I'm insecure, you can tell
But why am I leaving unless time had only meant well?
There's nothing left now to excite you, no reason to try
Still I remember a candlelit sky
And the summer surrounding the ground where you and I lay
And though we were always alone with our secrets known
We both were aware and afraid our closeness might end
My love's like a dancer, she weaves through the dangers complete
Her well rehearsed answers with rational reasons for feet
And if it decreases or ceases to always seem right
I'll just remember a November Night
When the dawn on your doorway shone white with frost
And the soft love that always began with the touch of your hand
And recall the mornings that tossed your hair in the windEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hearts on fire
My love for you brought only misery
Hearts on fire
Put out the flames and set this cold heart free
One short year our love had burned
Until at last I guess you learned
The art of being untrue and then goodbye
What could I do except to cry and moan
Lord, what have I done
Once we were as sweet and warm
As the golden morning sun
Hearts on fire
My love for you brought only misery
Hearts on fire
Put out the flames and set this cold heart free
Bridge
Friends say it's just a game
And that no one is to blame
Go out forget her lies
But she'll be there and sparks will fly
My love has turned to hatred
Sleep escapes me still
God, please take this heart of mine
'cause if you don't the devil will
Hearts on fire
My love for you brought only misery
Hearts on fire
Put out the flames and set this cold heart free

It was forty or fifty years ago
A big shot played with time
Mister Walker held the door
And both kept Cord and line
Watched and checked on every single day
Building his own special cars
His very special way
Ooh! The new soft shoe
Ooh! The new soft shoe
And then walking through a southern road
I saw a shoeshine stand
A man was talking to a crowd
Holding slippers in his hands
Don't you know the same thing happens
Each and every day?
Did you ever hear a song
That's hard to even play?
Ooh! The new soft shoe
Ooh! The new soft shoe
Then a color TV broadcast
Snuck from New Orleans
Showed me one more man who spoke
And wore bright blue and green
When you saw him talk his way
Was when he showed his claws
And spoke to people every day
Just to get applause
Ooh! The new soft shoe
Ooh! The new soft shoe .....EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

That's all it took
The mention of your name
And all my love for you
Burst into flame
I tried so hard
To let you go, but look
How I still tremble at your name
That's all it took
That's all it took
To make me know that I still care
It seems my heart just can't give up
The dreams we used to share
I tell my friends I'm happy
But they read me like a book
And when today I heard them say
Your name that's all it took
That s all it took to make me yearn for your embrace
I guess I might as well admit
No one can take your place
I fell for you completely
Sinker line and hook
And when today I heard them say
Your name that's all it took
And when today I heard them say
Your name that's all it tookEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Time can pass and time can heal
But it don't ever pass the way I feel
You went away a long time ago
And why you left I never knew
The lonely days and lonely nights
Guess the world knows I ain't feelin' right
And when you're gone the hours pass so slow
And now I'm still feeling blue
And baby
Since you've walked out of my life
I never felt so low
Can't help but wonder why you had to go
There are many girls but I can't say
They come and go but still I feel this way
And ever since the day you said goodbye
No one treats me like you used to do
I hope you're out and happy now
Doing up the town cause you know how
Every time I hear your name I want to die
And now I'm still feeling blue
All right
And baby
Since you've walked out of my life
I never felt so low
Can't help but wonder why you had to go
I hope you're out and happy now
Doing up the town cause you know how
Every time I hear your name I want to die
And now I'm still feeling blue
And now I'm still feeling blue

Well, it's said my life is been so free and easy
But I'll tell you now the story isn't so
Cause I've spent a lot of time down on the corner
Tasting tears and spilling whisky on the floor
Such a shame that it's so hard from me
To tell the truth to you
But by now you know the kind of man I am;
So don't turn your pretty face away from me, dear
Cause there's kids and this game don't understand
One more night like this would put me six feet under
But my heart will still be fighting for your love
Just remember, little darling, that I love you
And kiss the children for me, please, before you go
So don't play this crazy game with me no longer
Cause I won't be able to resist my rage
And the gun that's hangin on the kitchen wall, dear
Is like the road sign pointing straight to satan's cage

Oh, well, I was born in a little bitty tar hut
And they called me a man 'cause I couldn't
Keep my big, big mouth shut
So what's the sense of me sitting here leaving
When any ole day I might be even
And Lord knows that New York City's got
A lot to do with it
I wish someday I could find the way
To get it out of my grain
This dirty old town's gonna sink right down
And I don't want to go with it
Well I wish there was a way that
I knew to get even
A way to get a lick in
A 'bobbin' and a 'weavin'
Any ole thing besides goin' and a'leavin'
You can do on a train
Well, I once knew a man who sailed around
The world twice
He would have made it three but he took
A lot of bad advice
So you just tell me what's the sense of me
Sittin' here leavin'
When any ole day I might get even
And Lord knows New York City's got
Alot to do with it
I wish someday I could find a way to get it out

Darling, there is something I must tell you, you must know
But it's so hard to say the words I feel
This fancy that I'm on has been going on too long
It's time we stopped pretending things are real

'Cause I've been living deep in sin, I've been living blind
And I don't know just what's right or wrong
To take a chance on losing you was such a silly thing to do
The chance I might wake up and find you gone

Blue, so blue, my love is burning blue
Any brighter flame would be a lie
Blue, so blue, my love still burns for you
But I know that I'll only make you cry

A thief can only steal from you, he cannot break your heart
He'll never touch the precious things inside
So one like you should surely be miles and miles away from me
Then you'd never care how much I've lied

So try to understand the pain
It takes so long when I explain
Please, don't you forget how much I've liedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

A house not a home was a picture satin painted
For sweet little sister and me
Our daddy would frown while mother was praying
His heart was so hardened that he would not believe
In anger he'd swear his voice cold and loud
His Sundays were spent out with the gamblin' crowd
I've never seen my daddy inside a house of God
For Satin held his hand down the path of sin he trod
Not long ago our circle was broken
When God called on mother one night
In a voice sweet and low her last words were spoken
Asking our daddy to raise her children right
The angels rejoiced in heaven last night
I heard my daddy praying: "Dear God make it right"
He was smiling and singing with tears in his eyes
While mother with the angels rejoiced last night
While mother with the angels rejoiced last nightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
