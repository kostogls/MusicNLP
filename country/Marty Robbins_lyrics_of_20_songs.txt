Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Feleena would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Feleena
Wicked and evil while casting her spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain, I could tell

One night, a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Feleena, the girl that I love

So in anger, I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run
Out through the back door of Rosa's, I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back and away, I did ride

Just as fast as I could from
The West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

Back in El Paso, my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

I saddled up and away, I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow, a bullet may find me
Tonight, nothing's worse than this pain in my heart

And at last, here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Feleena, I go
Off to my right, I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

But my love for Feleena is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Feleena has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Feleena, goodbye11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

To the town of Agua Fria
Rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him
Didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business
No one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them
Had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning
When he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side
Slowly looking all around
"He's an outlaw loose and running"
Came the whisper from each lip
"And he's here to do some business
With the big iron on his hip"
Big iron on his hip

In this town there lived an outlaw
By the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him
And that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer
Though a youth of twenty-four
And the notches on his pistol
Numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more
Now the stranger started talking
Made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona Ranger
Wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw
Back alive, or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter
He was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

Wasn't long before the story
Was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry
Men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him
Twenty men had made a slip
Twenty-one would be the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

The morning passed so quickly
It was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven
When they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows
Everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome Ranger
Was about to meet his death
'Bout to meet his death
There was forty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger
Is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather
'Fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the Ranger's aim was deadly
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment
And the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body
Of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin'
But he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip27EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

All day I've faced a barren waste
Without the taste of water
Cool water
Old Dan and I with throats burned dry
And souls that cry for water
Cool, clear water

The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water
Cool water
And with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water
Cool, clear water

Keep a-movin, Dan, dontcha listen to him, Dan
He's a devil, not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can ya see that big, green tree?
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waiting there for you and me?
Water
Cool, clear water
The shadows sway and seem to say
Tonight we pray for water
Cool water
And way up there He'll hear our prayer
And show us where there's water
Cool, clear water

Keep a-movin, Dan, dontcha listen to him, Dan
He's a devil, not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can ya see that big, green tree?
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waitin' there for you and me?
Water
Cool, clear water

When I hear the rain a-comin' down
It makes me sad and blue
Was on a rainy night like this
That Flo said we were through

I told her how I loved her and
I begged her not to go
But another man had changed her mind
So I said goodbye to Flo

Alone within my cell tonight
My heart is filled with fear
The only sound within the room
Is the falling of each tear

I think about the thing I've done
I know it wasn't right
They'll bury Flo tomorrow
But they're hanging me tonight
They're hanging me tonight

That night he came and took my Flo
And headed into town
I knew I had to find this man
And try to gun him down
As I walked by a dim café
And I looked through the door
I saw my Flo with her new love
And I couldn't stand no more
I couldn't stand no more

I took my pistol from my hip
And with a trembling hand
I took the life of pretty Flo
And that good for nothin' man
That good for nothin' man

I think about the thing I've done
I know it wasn't right
They'll bury Flo tomorrow
But they're hanging me tonight
They're hanging me tonight4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When I was but a young man I was wild and full of fire
A youth within my teens, but full of challenge and desire
I ran away from home and left my mother and my dad
I know it grieved them so to think their only boy was bad
I fell in with an outlaw band, their names were known quite well
How many times we robbed and plundered, I could never tell
This kind of sinful living leads only to a fall
I learned that much and more the night I heard my Master call
One night we rustled cattle, a thousand head or so
And started them out on the trail that leads to Mexico
But a norther started blowing and lightning flashed about
I thought someone was calling me, I thought I heard a shout
Then at that moment lightning struck not twenty yards from me
And left there was a giant cross where once there was a tree
And this time I knew I heard a voice, a voice so sweet and strange
A voice that came from everywhere, a voice that called my name
So frightened I was thinking of sinful deeds I'd done
I failed to see the thousand head of cattle start to run
The cattle they stampeded, were running all around
My pony ran but stumbled and it threw me to the ground
I felt the end was near, that death would be the price
When a mighty bolt of lightning showed the face of Jesus Christ
And I cried oh Lord forgive me, don't let it happen now
I want to live for you alone, Oh God these words I vow
My wicked past unfolded, I thought of wasted years
When another bolt of lightning killed a hundred head of steers
And the others rushed on by me and I was left to live
The Master had a reason, life is his to take or give
A miracle performed that night, I wasn't meant to die
The dead ones formed a barricade least six or seven high
And right behind it there was I, afraid but safe and sound
I cried and begged for mercy kneeling there upon the ground
A pardon I was granted, my sinful soul set free
No more to fear the angry waves upon life's stormy sea
Forgiven by the love of God, a love that will remain
I gave my life and soul the night the Saviour called my name...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In the southern part of Texas
In the town of San Antone
There's a fortress all in ruins
That the weeds have overgrown
You may look in vain for crosses
And you'll never see a one
But sometimes between the setting
And the rising of the sun
You can hear a ghostly bugle
As the men go marchin' by
You can hear them as they answer
To that roll call in the sky
Colonel Travis, Davy Crockett
And a hundred eighty more
Captain Dickinson, Jim Bowie
Present and accounted for
Back in 1836, Houston said to Travis
"Get some volunteers and go
Fortify the Alamo"
Well the men came from Texas
And from old Tennessee
And they joined up with Travis
Just to fight for the right to be free
Indian scouts with squirrel guns
Men with muzzle-loaders
Stood together, heel and toe
To defend the Alamo
"You may never see your loved ones"
Travis told them that day
"Those who want to can leave now
Those who fight to the death let 'em stay"
In the sand he drew the line
With his army sabre
Out of a hundred eighty five
Not a soldier crossed the line
With his banners a-dancin'
In the dawn's golden light
Santa Anna came prancin'
On a horse that was black as the night
Sent an officer to tell
Travis to surrender
Travis answered with a shell
And a rousin' rebel yell
Santa Anna turned scarlet
"Play degüello!" he roared
"I will show them no quarter
Everyone will be put to the sword!"
One hundred and eighty five
Holdin' back five thousand
Five days, six days, eight days, ten
Travis held and held again
Then he sent for replacements
For his wounded and lame
But the troops that were comin'
Never came, never came, never came
Twice he charged then blew recall
On the fatal third time
Santa Anna breached the wall
And he killed them, one and all
Now the bugles are silent
And there's rust on each sword
And the small band of soldiers
Lie asleep in the arms of the Lord
In the southern part of Texas
Near the town of San Antone
Like a statue on his pinto
Rides a cowboy all alone
And he sees the cattle grazin'
Where a century before
Santa Anna's guns were blazin'
And the cannons used to roar
And his eyes turn sorta misty
And his heart begins to glow
And he takes his hat off slowly
To the men of Alamo
To the thirteen days of glory
At the siege of Alamo1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I told Mary about us
I told her about our great sin
Mary cried and forgave me
And Mary took me back again
Said if I wanted my freedom
I could be free evermore
But I don't want to be, and I don't want to see
Mary cry anymore

Oh, devil woman
Devil woman, let go of me
Devil woman, let me be
And leave me alone
I want to go home

Mary is waitin' and weepin'
Down in our shack by the sea
Even after I've hurt her
Mary' still in love with me
Devil woman it's over
Trapped no more by your charms
Cause I don't want to stay, I want to get away
Woman let go of my arm
Oh, devil woman
Devil woman, let go of me
Devil woman, let me be
And leave me alone
I want to go home

Devil woman you're evil
Like the dark coral reef
Like the winds that bring high tides
You bring sorrow and grief
You made me ashamed to face Mary
Barely had the strength to tell
Skies are not so black, Mary took me back
Mary has broken your spell

Oh, devil woman
Devil woman, let go of me
Devil woman, let me be
And leave me alone
I want to go home

Runnin' along by the seashore
Runnin' as fast as I can
Even the seagulls are happy
Glad I'm coming home again
Never again will I ever
Cause another tear to fall
Down the beach I see, what belongs to me
The one I want most of all
Oh, devil woman, devil woman
Don't follow me
Devil woman, let me be
And leave me alone
I'm going back homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Out in New Mexico, many long years ago
There in a shack on the desert, one night in a storm
Amid streaks of lightnin' and loud desert thunder
To a young Mexican couple, a baby was born;
Just as the baby cried, thunder and lightnin' died
Moon gave it's light to the world and the stars did the same
Mother and Father, both proud of the daughter
That heaven had sent them, Feleena was this baby's name
When she was seventeen, bothered by crazy dreams
She ran away from the shack and left them to roam
Father and Mother, both asked one another
What made her run away, what made Feleena leave home;
Tired of the desert nights, poverty, grief and strife
She ran away late one night in the moon's golden gleam
She didn't know where she'd go, but she'd get there
And she would find happiness, if she would follow her dream
After she ran away, she went to Sante Fe
And in the year that she stayed there, she learned about life
In just a little while, she learned that with a smile
She could have pretty clothes, she could be any man's wife;
Rich men romanced her, they dined and they danced her
She understood men and she treated them all just the same
A form that was fine and rare, dark shining glossy hair
Lovely to look at Feleena was this woman's name
Restless in Sante Fe, she had to get away
To any town where the lights had a much brighter glow
One cowboy mentioned the town of El Paso
They never stopped dancin' and money like whiskey did flow;
She bought a one-way, a ticket from Sante Fe
Three days and nights on a stage with a rest now and then
She didn't mind that, she knew she would find that
Her new life would be more exciting than where she had been
The stage made it's last stop, up there on the mountain top
To let her see all of the lights at the foot of the hill
Her world was brighter and deep down inside her
An uncontrolled beating, her young heart just wouldn't be still;
She got a hotel, a room at the Lily Belle
Quickly she changed to a form-fitting black satin dress
Ev'ry man stopped to stare, at this form fine and rare
Even the women remarked of the charm she possessed
Dancin' and laughter, was what she was after
And Rosa's Cantina had lights, with love in the gleam
That's what she hunted and that's what she wanted
Rosa's was one place, a nice girl would never be seen;
It was the same way, it was back in Sante Fe
Men would make fools of themselves at the thought of romance
Rosa took heed of, the place was in need of
This kind of excitement, so she paid Feleena to dance
A year passed and maybe more and then through the swingin' doors
Came a young cowboy so tall and so handsomely dressed
This one was new in town, hadn't been seen around
He was so different, he wasn't like all of the rest;
Feleena danced close to him, then threw a rose to him
Quickly he walked to her table and there he sat down
And in a day or so, wherever folks would go
They'd see this young cowboy, showin' Feelena the town
Six weeks he went with her, each minute spent with her
But he was insanely jealous of glances she'd give
Inside he was a-hurtin', from all of her flirtin'
That was her nature and that was the way that she lived;
She flirted one night, it started a gun-fight
And after the smoke cleared away, on the floor lay a man
Feleena's young lover, had shot down another
And he had to leave there, so out through the back door he ran
The next day at five o'clock, she heard a rifle shot
Quickly she ran to the door, that was facin' the pass
She saw her cowboy, her wild-ridin' cowboy
Low in the saddle, her cowboy was ridin' in fast;
She ran to meet him, to kiss and to greet him
He saw her and motioned her back, with a wave of his hand
Bullets were flyin', Feleena was cryin'
As she saw him fall from the saddle and into the sand
Feleena knelt near him, to hold and to hear him
When she felt the warm blood that flowed from the wound in his side
He raised to kiss her and she heard him whisper
"Never forget me - Faleena it's over, goodbye."
Quickly she grabbed for, the six-gun that he wore
And screamin' in anger and placin' the gun to her breast
Bury us both deep and maybe we'll find peace
And pullin' the trigger, she fell 'cross the dead cowboy's chest
Out in El Paso, whenever the wind blows
If you listen closely at night, you'll hear in the wind
A woman is cryin', it's not the wind sighin'
Old timer's tell you, Feleena is callin' for him;
You'll hear them talkin' and you'll hear them walkin'
You'll hear them laugh and you'll look, but there's no one around
Don't be alarmed - there is really no harm there
It's only the young cowboy, showin' Feleena the townEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You came down to this southern town last summer
To show the folks a brand new way of life
But all you've shown the folks around here is trouble
And you've only added misery to their strife
Your concern is not to help the people
And I'll say again, though it's been often said
Your concern is just to bring discomfort, my friend
And your policy is just a little red
Now, ain't I right (ain't he right)
(ain't he right)
It matters not to you how people suffer
And should they, you'd consider that a gain
You bring a lot of trouble to the town and then you leave
That's part of your Communistic game
I detect a little Communisim
I can see it in the things ya do
Communisim, socialism call it what you like
There's very little difference in the two
Now, ain't I right (ain't he right)
(ain't he right)
Your followers sometimes have been a bearded, hatless bunch
There's even been a minister or two
A priest, a nun, a rabbi and an educated man
Have listened and been taken in by you
Aw, the country's full of two-faced politicians
Who encourage you with words that go like this
Burn your draft card if you like, it's good to disagree
That's a get aquainted Communistic kiss
Now, ain't I right (ain't he right)
(ain't he right)
One politician said it would be nice to send some blood
And help the enemy in Vietnam
That's what he says, here's what I say
Let's just keep the blood
Instead let's send that politician man
Let's rid the country of the politicians
Who call us tramps, that march out in our streets
Protesting those who wanna fight for freedom, my friend
This kind of leader makes our country weak
Now, ain't I right (ain't he right)
(ain't he right)
Let's look and find the strong and able leaders
It's time we found just how our neighbours stand
If we're to win this war with Communism
Let's fight it here as well as Vietman
Let's rise as one and meet our obligations
So Communistic boots will never trod
Across the fields of freedom that were given to us
With the blessing of our great almighty God
Across the fields of freedom that were given to us
With the blessing of our great almighty God4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Nobody knew where he came from
They only knew he came in
Slowly he walked to the end of the bar
And he ordered up one slug of gin
Well, I could see that he wasn't a large man
I could tell that he wasn't too tall
I judged him to be 'bout five-foot three
And his voice was a soft Texas drawl
Said he was needin' some wages
'Fore he could ride for the west
Said he could do most all kind of work
Said he could ride with the best
There in his blue eyes was sadness
That comes from the need of a friend
And tho' he tried, he still couldn't hide
The loneliness there, deep within
Said he would work thru the winter
For thirty a month and his board
I started to say where he might land a job
When a fellow came in thru the door
And I could tell he was lookin' for trouble
From the way that he came stompin' in
He told me to leave Shorty there by himself
Come down and wait on a man
The eyes of the little man narrowed
The smile disappeared from his face
Gone was the friendliness that I had seen
And a wild look of hate took its' place
But the big one continued to mock him
And he told me that I'd better go
Find him a couple of glasses of milk
Then maybe Shorty would grow
When the little man spoke, there was stillness
He made sure that everyone heard
Slowly he stepped away from the bar
And I still remember these words
Oh! it's plain that you're lookin' for trouble
Trouble's what I try to shun
If that's what you want, then that's what you'll get
Cause cowboy, we're both packin' guns
His hand was already positioned
Feet wide apart on the floor
I hadn't noticed but there on his hip
Was a short-barreled Bass Forty-Four
It was plain he was ready and waitin'
He leaned a bit forward and said
When you call me Shorty, say Mister, my friend
Maybe you'd rather be dead
In the room was a terrible silence
As the big one stepped out on the floor
All drinkin' stopped and the tick of the clock
Said death would wait ten seconds more
He cursed once or twice in a whisper
And he said with a snarl on his lips
Nobody's Mister to me, little man!
And he grabbed for the gun on his hips
But the little man's hands was like lightning
The Bass Forty-Four was the same
The Forty-Four spoke and it sent lead and smoke
And seventeen inches of flame
For the big one had never cleared leather
Beaten before he could start
A little round hole had appeared on his shirt
The bullet went clear thru his heart
The little man stood there a moment
Then holstered the Bass Forty-Four
It's always this way so I never stay
Slowly he walked out the door
Nobody knew where he came from
They won't forget he came by
They won't forget how a Forty-Four gun
One night made the difference in size
As for me, I'll remember the sadness
Shown in the eyes of the man
If we meet someday, you can bet I would say
That it's me, Mr. Shorty, your friend1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I was hangin' 'round town, just spendin' my time
Out of a job, not earnin' a dime
A feller steps up and he said, "I suppose
You're a bronc fighter from looks of your clothes."
"You figures me right, I'm a good one." I claim
"Do you happen to have any bad ones to tame?"
Said "He's got one, a bad one to buck
At throwin' good riders, he's had lots of luck."
I gets all het up and I ask what he pays
To ride this old nag for a couple of days
He offered me ten; I said, "I'm your man
A bronc never lived that I couldn't span."
He said: "Get your saddle, I'll give you a chance"
In his buckboard we hopped and he drives to the ranch
I stayed 'til mornin' and right after chuck
I stepped out to see if this outlaw can buck
Down in the horse corral standin' alone
Is an old Caballo, a Strawberry Roan
His legs are all spavined, he's got pigeon toes
Little pig eyes and a big Roman nose
Little pin ears that touched at the tip
A big 44 brand was on his left hip
U-necked and old, with a long, lower jaw
I could see with one eye, he's a regular outlaw
I gets the blinds on 'im and it sure is a fright
Next comes the saddle and I screws it down tight
Then I steps on 'im and I raises the blinds
Get outta the way boys, he's gonna unwind
He sure is a frog-walker, he heaves a big sigh
He only lacks wings, for to be on the fly
He turns his old belly right up to the sun
He sure is a sun-fishin', son-of-a-gun
He's about the worst bucker I've seen on the range
He'll turn on a Nickel and give you some change
He hits on all fours and goes up on high
Leaves me a spinnin' up there in the sky
I turns over twice and I comes back to earth
I lights in a cussin' the day of his birth
I know there are ponies that I cannot ride
There's some of them left, they haven't all died
I'll bet all my money, the man ain't alive
That'll stay with Old Strawberry
When he makes his high diveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'll sing you a true song of Billy the Kid
I'll sing of some desperate deeds that he did
Way out in New Mexico long long ago
When a man's only chance was his own forty-four
When Billy the Kid was a very young lad
In old Silver City he went to the bad
Way out in the West with a gun in his hand
At the age of twelve years he did kill his first man
There's Mexican maidens play guitars and sing
Songs about Billy, their boy bandit king
'Ere his young manhood has reached his sad end
With a notch on his pistol for twenty one men!
Was on a sad night when poor Billy died
He said to his friend, "I'm not satisfied
There's twenty one men I have put bullets through
Sheriff Pat Garrett must make twenty two!"
I'll sing you how Billy the Kid met his fate
The bright moon was shinin', the hour was late
Shot down by Pat Garrett who once was his friend
The young outlaw's life is now come to an end
There's many a man with a face fine and fair
Who start out in life with a chance to be square
Just like poor Billy they wander astray
They'll lose their lives in the very same way!3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

From thirty thousand feet above
The desert floor, I see it there below
A city with a legend
The west Texas city of El Paso
Where long ago I heard a song
About a Texas cowboy and a girl
And a little place called Rosa's
Where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl
I don't recall who sang the song
But I recall the story that I heard
And as I look down on the city
I remember each and every word
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy
And the way he used a gun
To kill another cowboy
Then he had to leave El Paso on the run

El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
The cowboy lived and rode away
But love was strong, he couldn't stay
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand
El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
I try not to let you cross my mind
But still I find there's such a mystery in the song
That I don't understand
My mind is down there somewhere
As I fly above the badlands of New Mexico
I can't explain why I should know
The very trail he rode back to El Paso
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time?
And does the mystery deepen
Cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time?
Somewhere in my deepest thoughts
Familiar scenes and memories unfold
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long
But I have never told
Like every time I fly up through the heavens
And I see you there below
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso

El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
Could it be, that I could be
The cowboy in this mystery
That died there in that desert sand so long ago?
El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
A voice tells me to go and see
Another voice, keeps tellin' me
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso
El Paso City.....EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I got a hundred and sixty acres in the valley
Got a hundred and sixty acres of the best
Got an old stove there that'll cook three square
And a bunk where I can lay me down to rest

Head for home when day is done
With my pocket money jinglin' in my jeans

And now my friends you've asked me what makes me sad and still
And why my brow is darkened like the clouds upon the hill
Run in your ponies closer and I'll tell to you my tale
Of Utah Carol my partner and his last ride on the trail
We rode the range together and rode it side by side
I loved him like a brother, and I wept when Utah died
We were rounding up one morning when work was almost done
When on his side the cattle started on a frightened run
Underneath the saddle that the boss's daughter rode
Utah that very morning had placed a bright red robe
So the saddle might ride easy for Lenore his little friend
And it was this red blanket that brought him to his end
The blanket was now dragging behind her on the ground
The frightened cattle saw it and charged it with a bound
Lenore then saw her danger and turned her pony's face
And leaning in the saddle tied the blanket to its place
But in leaning lost her balance, fell in front of that wild tide
"Lay still Lenore I'm coming" were the words that Utah cried
His faithful pony saw her and reached her with a bound
I thought he'd been successful, and raised her from the ground
But the weight upon the saddle had not been felt before
His backcinch snapped like thunder and he fell by Lenore
Picking up the blanket he swung it over his head
And started cross the prairie, "Lay still Lenore" he said
When he got the stampede turned and saved Lenore his friend
He turned to face the cattle and meet his fatal end
His six gun flashed like lightning, the report rang loud and clear
As the cattle rushed and killed him he dropped the leading steer
On his funeral morning I heard the preacher say
"I hope we'll all meet Utah at the roundup far away"
Then they wrapped him in a blanket that saved his little friend
And it was this red blanket that brought him to his end1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I rode out of Kansas City, going south to Mexico
I was running dodging danger,left the girl that I loved so
Far behind lay Kansas City and the past that I had earned
Twenty notches on my six gun marked the lessons I had learned
Many times I sold my fast gun for a place to lay my head
Till the nights began to haunt me by the men that I left dead
Couldn't stand it any longer with the life that I'd begun
So I said good-bye to Jeannie and became a running gun
I rode into Amarillo as the sun sank in the west
My thoughts in Kansas City and the girl that I love best
As I smiled and kissed her gently and then turned away to go
Said I'd send for her to meet me when I reached old Mexico
I had barely left the saddle and my foot just touched the ground
When a cold voice from the shadows told me not to turn around
Said he knew about my fast gun, knew the price paid by the law
Challenged by a bounty hunter, so I turned around to draw
I knew someday I'd meet him, for his hand like lightning flashed
My own gun stood in leather as his bullet tore its path
As my strength was slowly fading, I could see him walk away
And I knew that where I lie today, he too must lie some day
Now a crowd is slowly gathering but my eyes are growing dim
And my thoughts return to Jeannie and the home that we had planned
Oh please tell her, won't you mister, that she's still the only one
But a woman's love is wasted when she loves a running gun1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

A white sport coat and a pink carnation
I'm all dressed up for the dance
A white sport coat and a pink carnation
I'm all alone in romance

Once you told me long ago
To the prom with me you'd go
Now you've changed your mind it seems
Someone else will hold my dreams

A white sport coat and a pink carnation
And in a blue, blue mood
(A white sport coat and a pink carnation)
I'm all dressed up for the dance
(A white sport coat and a pink carnation)
I'm all alone in romance

Once you told me long ago
To the prom with me you'd go
Now you've changed your mind it seems
Someone else will hold my dreams
A white sport coat and a pink carnation
I'm in a blue, blue mood2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

As I walked out in the streets of Laredo
As I walked out in Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy, wrapped all in white linen
Wrapped in white linen, as cold as the clay

Oh, beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
Sing the Death March as you carry me along
Take me to the  valley, there lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy and know I've done wrong

I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy
These words he did say as I boldly walked by
Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story
Got shot in the breast and I know I must die

Go fetch me some water, a cool cup of water
To cool my parched lips then the poor cowboy said
Before I returned, his spirit had left him
Had gone to his maker, the cowboy was dead

Oh, beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
Sing the Death March as you carry me along
Take me to the  valley, there lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy and know I've done wrong2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Don't worry 'bout me
It's all over now
Though I may be blue
I'll manage somehow

Love can't be explained
Can't be controlled
One day it's warm
Next day it's cold

Don't pity me
'Cause I'm feeling blue
Don't be ashamed
It might have been you

Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh, love
Kiss me one time, then go, love
I'll understand
Don't worry 'bout me

Sweet, sweet, sweet, love
I want you to be
As happy as I
When you love me

I'll never forget you
Your sweet memory
It's all over now
Don't worry bout me

When one heart tells
One heart
One heart goodbye
One heart is free
One heart will cry

Oh, oh, oh, ohh, oh sweet
Sweet baby, sweet, baby sweet
It's alright
Don't worry 'bout me

I came to town to search for gold
And I brought with me a memory
And I seem to hear the night wind cry
"Go hang your dreams on the hangin' tree
Your dreams of love that could never be
Hang your faded dreams on the hangin' tree!"
(The hangin' tree)

I searched for gold and I found my gold
And I found a girl who loved just me
And I wished that I could love her too
But I'd left my heart on the hangin' tree
I'd left my heart with a memory (a memory)
And a faded dream on the hangin' tree
(The hangin' tree)

Now there were men who craved my gold
And meant to take (ooh) my gold from me
When a man is gone he needs no gold
So they carried me to the hangin' tree
To join my dreams and a memory (a memory)
Yes, they carried me to the hangin' tree
(The hangin' tree)

To really live you must almost die (wop doo-wah)
And it happened just that way with me (wop doo-wah)
They took the gold and set me free
(Ah) And I walked away from the hangin' tree
I walked away from the hangin' tree
(the hangin' tree)
And my own true love, she walked with me!

That's when I knew that the hangin' tree
Was a tree of life, new life for me
A tree of hope, new hope for me
A tree of love, new love for me
The hangin' tree (the hangin' tree)
The hangin' tree (the hangin' tree)
The hangin' tree! (the hangin' tree)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
