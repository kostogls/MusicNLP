Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings the grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country

I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

We turn the dirt and work until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
Then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah)

I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
(This is God's country)
God's country

I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pinewood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (Yeah)

I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country, I saw the light)
Yeah, I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin' (Yeah)
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around

Don't have to leave this town to see the world
'Cause it's something that I gotta do
I don't wanna look back in 30 years
And wonder who you're married to
Wanna say it now, wanna make it clear
For only you and God to hear
When you love someone, they say you set 'em free
But that ain't gonna work for me

I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
Lookin' in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
You

All the wasted days, all the wasted nights
I blame it all on being young
Got no regrets 'cause it got me here
But I don't wanna waste another one
I been thinkin' about what I want in my life
It begins and ends the same
If I had to choose what I couldn't lose
There'd only be one thing
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
Lookin' in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
You
I don't wanna love nobody but you (You)

Wanna say it now, wanna make it clear
For only you and God to hear

I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me (Next to me)
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you (I don't wanna love nobody)

Her kisses taste like whiskey
Burning through my veins
She don't know how to miss me
She hits right where she aims
Baby's got my number and she's calling me up
Knows what she's doing with a single touch

She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes, I think she must get off
On turning me on, turning me on

Knows how to set me on fire
She's always holding the match
And when my body's beside hers
There ain't no turning back
She's Revlon red in the blackest night
Lighting up the room in the world just like

She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off
On turning me on, turning me on
Once she gets it started, man, it's all night long
She's the needle on the vinyl of a midnight song
She's turning me on, turning me on

She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off
On turning me on, turning me on, yeah

Turning me on, turning me on

Run ol' Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At the honky-tonk, where their boots stomp
All night, what

When you put two and two together
You figure out love's got four letters
I shoulda known that when I met her
But she had to spell it out for me
After all that second guessing
It's been a long hard history lesson
Hell, that's a class I got an F in
But now I understand perfectly

She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S.O.B. in sober
She put the hang in hangover (Hangover)
She put the ex in sex
She put the low in blow
She put a big F.U. in my future
Yeah, she’s got a way
She’s got a way with words
Yeah, she's got a way with words

Little words like "I" and "do"
Lying, cheating, screwed

They got a brand new meaning now

Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford
Flies found a hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Mama poured grease in a Crisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand
Where them yellow jackets torn me up
And I ain't making this up

Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it

Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow
Them ol' Duke boys were flattening the hills
Hollywood was fake, wrestling was real
Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawn mower around
I'd go back there right now
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life

Yeah, I met you 'fore anyone knew my name
Playin' for pennies on the dive bar stage
Split an all-star special on our first date in a Waffle House booth
Your daddy was cryin' when he gave you away
'Cause all those country songs I played
They didn't come with a 401k
But hey, I had you

You can make a six pack on the carpet
Taste like a million dollar bill
You can make a one bed room apartment
Feel like a house up on the hill
You can make my truck out in the driveway
Roll like a cleaned up Cadillac
Girl, lookin' at you lookin' at me that way
Can make a man feel rich on minimum wage

Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage

You can give me a tab that's always open
Or give me a yacht parked out in the ocean
But all that keepin' up with the Jones'
It just ain't my style
Just give me some lights strung out in the yard
Give me a lawn chair under the stars
The top of the world's right where you are
'Cause every time you smile
You can make a six pack on the carpet
Taste like a million dollar bill
You can make a one bed room apartment
Feel like a house up on the hill

Girl, it's high time I tell ya
No more messin' around
Time to lay these cards on the table
And just throw it on out
I'm talkin' you and me with the same street name
Same last name, same everything
It's a real thing, a how I feel thing
So I'm a go on and take a swing

You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs, yeah

You can park your car in the driveway
I'll park my truck in the grass
I'll put a little swing on the front porch
If you put a little tea in my glass
Watch a sunset from a gravel road
Kiss me in the kitchen on your tippy toes
Still lovin' on you when the rooster crows
Watchin' way more than the garden grow
You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses

She left without leaving a number
Said, she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
'Cause she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year
Before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

If you're calling 'bout the car, I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got something to sell
You're wasting your time, I'm not buying
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then
If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone, all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

Well, this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

If you're calling 'bout my heart, it's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way, boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell, this is Austin
And I still love you
I still love you6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Sometimes I'm the guy with the boys, kicking it back
Or the guy with a guitar singing on a country track
I might be the guy with an ice cold can
Stirring up dust on some old farmland
When I walk into the party with you girl, you change all that

And I’m just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like, "Ain’t she beautiful?"
I’m invisible, but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they’re seein'
But, I don’t mind being the guy with the girl, no

It's funny watchin' 'em do the way they do
They come walkin' up to me but they only wanna talk to you
And I don't blame 'em that they're hypnotized
They keep staring at your heartbreak eyes
It's like their heart starts stoppin' when you come walkin' into the room

And I turn into the guy with the girl everybody wants to know

String of white lights making your eyes shine tonight

Standin' in the liquor store, starin' at a fifth
But they picked up a handle instead

Every time I hear that song
I’m standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and ooh-ooh-ooh
I still think about you-ooh-ooh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and ooh-ooh-ooh
I still think about you-ooh-ooh
I still think about you

There’s something in the bittersweet feeling of a memory
Right there in the moment, all I ever wanted was you and me
We were crying, we were wasted
We were dying, when they played it

Every time I hear that song
I’m standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and ooh-ooh-ooh
I still think about you-ooh-ooh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and ooh-ooh-ooh
I still think about you-ooh-ooh
I still think about you
Oh, I still think about you
There's a soundtrack in my mind
That takes me back in time
When I hear that melody
I think about you and me

Every time I hear that song
I’m standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and ooh-ooh-ooh
I still think about you-ooh-ooh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and ooh-ooh-ooh
I still think about you-ooh-ooh
I still think about you
Oh, I still think about you
I still think about you
Yeah, I still think about you

There's a soundtrack in my mind
That takes me back in time
When I hear that melody2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Girl, you're getting over him and I'm getting over her
The eyes have it made, ain't gotta say a word
Misery loves company, that's why it's you and me
Buying each other drinks
Back at the bar, as thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it

Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget

Go ahead and check your phone, like I've been checking mine
Nobody's ex is texting for a rewind
Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
What we're get'in through

Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget (yeah)
Just what we came here to forget
Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
What we're getting through

Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget

What we came here to forget
What we came here to forget
Baby, baby
That's what we came here to forget7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well I caught my wife with another man
And it cost me ninety nine
On a prison farm in Georgia
Close to the Florida line
Well I'd been here for two long years
I finally made the warden my friend
And so he sentenced me to a life of ease
Taking care of Ol' Red
Now Ol' Red he's the damnedest dog that I've ever seen
Got a nose that can smell a two-day trail
He's a four-legged trackin' machine
You can consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators and the quicksand beds
But all these years that I've been here
Ain't nobody got past Red
And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes
Well I paid off the guard and I slipped out a letter
To my cousin up in Tennessee
Oh and he brought down a blue tick hound
She was pretty as she could be
Well they penned her up in the swampland
'Bout a mile just south of the gate
And I'd take Ol' Red for his evenin' run
I'd just drop him off and wait
And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes

Now Ol' Red got real used to seein'
His lady every night
And so I kept him away for three or four days
And waited till the time got right
Well I made my run with the evenin' sun
And I smiled when I heard them let Red out
Cause I was headed north to Tennessee
And Ol' Red was headed south
And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes

Now there's red-haired blue ticks all in the South
Love got me in here and love got me out5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I've been a walking heartache
I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately
Ain’t who I want to be
But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm blows through
And I need you

'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you
Gave me you

There's more here than what we’re seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you, an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
And I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you
Yeah!
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

On my own, I'm only
Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo

'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you, gave me you
He gave me you12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all

You don’t have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer
You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
But it’d sure be cool if you did

You can’t shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road
Just as far as you wanna go
Baby I’ll do whatever you wanna do

You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did
Have a night that you'll never forget
And now you're standing in the neon
Looking like a high I wanna be on

You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
