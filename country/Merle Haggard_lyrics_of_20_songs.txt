We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
We don't take no trips on LSD;
We don't burn no draft cards down on Main Street
But, We love living right, and being free
We don't make a party out of loving
But we like holding hands and pitching woo;
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do

And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball;
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
White lightning's still the biggest thrill of all

Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen;
A football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids here still respect the college dean

And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball;
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
White lightning's still the biggest thrill of all
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all

The first thing I remember knowing
Was a lonesome whistle blowing
And a young'un's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I'm bound
And no one could change my mind but mama tried
One and only rebel child
From a family meek and mild
My mama seemed to know what lay in store
Despite all my Sunday learning
Towards the bad I kept on turning
'Til mama couldn't hold me anymore

And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame 'cause mama tried

Dear old daddy, rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame 'cause mama tried2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm only human, I'm just a man
Help me to believe in what I can be and all that I am
Show me the stairway that I have to climb
Lord, for my sake, teach me to take one day at a time

One day at a time, sweet Jesus, that's all I'm asking of you
Give me the strength to do every day what I have to do
Yesterday's gone, sweet Jesus, and tomorrow may never be mine
So for my sake, teach me to take one day at a time

Do you remember when you walked among men?
Well Jesus you know, if you're looking below, it's worse now than then
Pushing and shoving, crowding my mind
So for my sake, teach me to take one day at a time

One day at a time, sweet Jesus, that's all I'm asking of you
Give me the strength to do every day what I have to do
Yesterday's gone, sweet Jesus, and tomorrow may never be mine
So for my sake, teach me to take one day at a time

Yes, just for my sake, teach me to take one day at a timeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom
And I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell
"Let my guitar-playing friend do my request."

Let him sing me back home with a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die

I recall last Sunday morning a choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers, "There's a song my mama sang
Could I hear it once before you move along?"

Won't you sing me back home with a song I used to hear?
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die
Sing me back home before I die1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I've been throwing horseshoes over my left shoulder
I've spent most all my life searching for that four-leaf clover
Yet you ran with me, chasing my rainbows
Honey, I love you too and that's the way love goes

That's the way love goes, babe
That's the music God made
For all the world to sing
It's never old, it grows
Losing makes me sorry
You say "Honey, now don't worry"
Don't you know I love you too?
And that's the way love goes

That's the way love goes, babe
That's the music God made
For all the world to sing
It's never old, it grows
Losing makes me sorry
You say "Honey, don't worry"
Don't you know I love you too?
And that's the way love goes1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Some folks call me a ramblin’ man
I do a lotta thumbin’ and a kickin’ cans
And it wouldn’t do an ounce of good to call my name
Cause daddy’s name wadn’t Willy Woodrow
And I wadn’t born and raised in no ghetto
Just a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing
Well I’m out to find me a wealthy woman
And a line of work that don’t take no diploma
I ain’t got much to lose but a lot to gain
Well some might call me a goodtime fella
I ain’t black and I ain’t yella
Just a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing
Yeah I don’t want no handout livin’
Don’t want any part of anything they’re givin’
I’m proud and white and I’ve got a song to sing
Well I’ve said a few things and I’ll admit it
If you wanna get ahead you gotta hump and get it
I’m a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing
Hump and git it now
Yeah I’m a small town boy been around a little
I like guitars and I like a fiddle
And that’s the kinda soul it takes to fan my flame
Well I’m a blue eyed Billy kinda frail and ruddy
So I’ll have to work to be somebody
I’m a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing
I don’t want no handout livin’
And don’t want any part of anything they’re givin’
I’m proud and white and I’ve got a song to sing
Well I’ve said a few things and I’ll admit it
If you wanna get ahead you gotta hump and get it

There's a big brown cloud in the city
And the countryside's a sin
And the price of life is too high to give up
Got to come down again
When the world wide war is over and done
And the dream of peace comes true
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew
When they find out how to burn water
And the gasoline car is gone
When an airplane flies without any fuel
And sunlight heats our home
One of these days when the air clears up
And the sun come shining through

We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew

Eating rainbow stew with a silver spoon
Underneath that sky of blue
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew
You don't have to get high to be happy
Just think about what's in store
When people start doing what they oughta to be doing
They won't be booing no more
When a president goes through the white house doors
And does what he says he'll do

I hear people talking bad
About the way they have to live here in this country
Harping on the wars we fight
And griping 'bout the way things ought to be
And I don't mind them switching sides
And standing up for things they believe in
But when they're running down our country, man
They're walking on the fighting side of me

They're walking on the fighting side of me
Running down a way of life
Our fighting men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singing be a warning
When you're running down our country, hoss
You're walking on the fighting side of me

I read about some squirrely guy
Who claims that he just don't believe in fighting
And I wonder just how long
The rest of us can count on being free
They love our milk and honey
But they preach about some other way of living
And when they're running down our country, man
They're walking on the fighting side of me
They're walking on the fighting side of me
Running down a way of life
Our fighting men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singing be a warning
When you're running down our country, man
You're walking on the fighting side of me
You're walking on the fighting side of me
Running down a way of life
Our fighting men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singing be a warning
When you're running down our country, hoss

I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The son of God discloses

And he walks with me and he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known

He speaks and the sound of his voice is so sweet
The birds hush their singing
And the melody that he gave to me
Within my heart is ringing

And he walks with me and he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever knownEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I almost felt you touchin' me just now
I wish I knew which way to turn and go
I feel so good and then I feel so bad
And I wonder what I ought to do

If I could only fly, if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand and I got nowhere to run
Another sinking sun and one more lonely night

The wind keeps blowin' somewhere every day
Tell me things get better somewhere up the way
Just dismal thinking on a dismal day
The sad songs for us to bear

If I could only fly, if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand and I got nowhere to run
Another sinking sun and one more lonely night

You know sometimes I write happy songs
Then some little thing goes wrong
And I wish they all could make you smile
Coming home soon and I want to stay
Maybe we can somehow get away
And I wish you could come with me when I go again
If I could only fly
If we could only fly
If you could only fly
There'd be no more lonely nightsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I could be holding you tonight
I could quit doing wrong, start doing right
You don't care about what I think

Think I'll just stay here and drink

Hey, putting you down won't square the deal
At least you'll know the way I feel
Hey, take all the money in the bank

Think I'll just stay here and drink

Hey, listen close and you can hear
That loud jukebox playing in my ear
Ain't no woman gonna change the way I think

I think I'll just stay here and drink

Yessir
Here comes that piano, yessir
Hey, hurtin' me now don't mean a thing
Since love ain't here it don't feel the pain
My mind ain't nothing but a total blank

I think I'll just stay here and drink
Yeah

We're gone3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Come lay by my side, little darling
Come lay your cool hand on my brow
And promise me that you will always
Be nobody's darling but mine
You're as sweet as the flowers in springtime
You're as pure as the dew from a rose
And I'd rather be somebody's darling
Than a poor boy that nobody knows
Be nobody's darling but mine, love
Be honest, be faithful, be kind
And promise me that you will always
Be nobody's darling but mine
Goodbye, little darling, I'm leaving
I'm leaving this cold world behind
So promise me that you will never
Be nobody's darling but mineEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's a big job just getting by
With nine kids and a wife
But I've been a working man
Dang near all my life
And I'll keep on working
As long as my two hands are fit to use

I'll drink my beer in a tavern
Sing a little bit of these working man blues

I'll keep my nose on the grindstone
Work hard every day
I might get a little tired on the weekend
After I draw my pay
But I'll go back to working
Come Monday morning I'm right back with the crew

I'll drink a little beer that evening
Sing a little bit of these working man blues

Sometimes I think about leaving
Do a little bummin' around
I want to throw my bills out the window
Catch a train to another town
But I'll go back working
I gotta buy my kids a brand new pair of shoes
I'll drink a little beer in a tavern
Cry a little bit of these working man blues

Here comes that working man


Well, hey-hey, the working man
The working man, like me
I ain't never been on welfare
And that's one place I won't be
'Cause I'll be working
As long as my two hands are fit to use

I'll drink my beer in a tavern
Sing a little bit of these working man blues

This song's for the working man2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Down every road, there's always one more city
I'm on the run, the highway is my home
I raised a lot of Cain back in my younger days
While Mama used to pray my crops would fail
Now I'm a hunted fugitive with just two ways
Outrun the law or spend my life in jail

I'd like to settle down, but they won't let me
A fugitive must be a rolling stone
Down every road, there's always one more city
I'm on the run, the highway is my home

I'm lonely, but I can't afford the luxury
Of having one I love to come along
She'd only slow me down and they'd catch up with me
For he who travels fastest goes alone

I'd like to settle down, but they won't let me
A fugitive must be a rolling stone
Down every road there's always one more city
I'm on the run, the highway is my home
I'm on the run, the highway is my homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My hat don't hang on the same nail too long
My ears can't stand to hear the same old song
And I don't leave the highway long enough
To bog down in the mud
'Cause I've got ramblin' fever in my blood

I caught this rambling fever long ago
When I first heard a lonesome whistle blow
If someone said I ever gave a damn
They damn sure told you wrong
I've had ramblin' fever all along

Ramblin' fever
The kind that can't be measured by degrees
Ramblin' fever
There ain't no kind of cure for my disease

There's times I'd like to bed down on a sofa
And let some pretty lady rub my back
And spend the early morning drinking coffee
And talkin' about when I'll be coming back
'Cause I don't let no woman tie me down
And I'll never get too old to get around
I want to die along the highway and rot away
Like some old highline pole
And rest this ramblin' fever in my soul

Ramblin' fever
The kind that can't be measured by degrees
Ramblin' fever
There ain't no kind of cure for my disease
Ooh, yeahEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I wish a buck was still silver
It was back when the country was strong
Back before Elvis
And before the Vietnam War came along
Before The Beatles and "Yesterday"
When a man could still work, and still would

Is the best of the free life behind us now?
And are the good times really over for good?

And are we rolling downhill
Like a snowball headed for hell?
With no kind of chance for
The flag or the Liberty Bell
I wish a Ford and a Chevy
Would still last ten years, like they should

Is the best of the free life behind us now?
And are the good times really over for good?

I wish coke was still cola
And a joint was a bad place to be
And it was back before Nixon
Lied to us all on TV
Before microwave ovens
When a girl could still cook, and still would
Is the best of the free life behind us now?
And are the good times really over for good?

Are we rolling downhill
Like a snowball headed for hell?
With no kind of chance for
The flag or the Liberty Bell
I wish a Ford and a Chevy
Would still last ten years, like they should

Is the best of the free life behind us now?
And are the good times really over for good?

Stop rolling downhill
Like a snowball headed for hell
Stand up for the flag
And let's all ring the Liberty Bell
Let's make a Ford and a Chevy
That'll still last ten years, like they should

'Cause the best of the free life is still yet to come
And the good times ain't over for good2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Silver wings shining in the sunlight
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight
They're taking you away, leaving me lonely
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight

"Don't leave me," I cry
Don't take that airplane ride
But you locked me out of your mind
Left me standing here behind

Silver wings shining in the sunlight
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight
They're taking you away, leaving me lonely
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight

I'm tired of this dirty old city
Entirely too much work and never enough play
And I'm tired of these dirty old sidewalks
Think I'll walk off my steady job today

Turn me loose, set me free
Somewhere in the middle of Montana
And give me all I've got coming to me
And keep your retirement
And your so-called social security
Big City, turn me loose and set me free
Yeah

Been working every day since I was twenty
Haven't got a thing to show for anything I've done
There's folks who never work and they've got plenty
Think it's time some guys like me had some fun
So

Turn me loose, set me free
Somewhere in the middle of Montana
And give me all I've got coming to me
And keep your retirement
And your so-called social security
Big City, turn me loose and set me free

Each night I leave the bar room when it's over
Not feeling any pain at closing time
But tonight your memory found me much too sober
I couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind

Tonight the bottle let me down
And let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let me down

I've always had a bottle I could turn to
And lately I've been turning every day
But the wine don't take effect the way it used to
And I'm hurting in an old familiar way

Tonight the bottle let me down
And let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let me down
Tonight the bottle let me down2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine

Got laid off down at the factory
And their timing is not the greatest in the world
Heaven knows I've been working hard
I wanted Christmas to be right for Daddy's girl
I don't mean to hate December
It's meant to be the happy time of year
But my little girl don't understand
Why Daddy can't afford no Christmas gear

If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fineEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
