He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he thought he'd stop
At Web's and have him a drink 'fore he went home to her
Andy Wo-Lo said hello, he said, "Hi, what's new?" and Wo said
"Sit down, I got some bad news that's gonna hurt"

Said, "I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you've been gone, she's been seein' that Amos boy, Seth"
Now he got mad and he saw red
Andy said, "Boy, don't you lose your head
'Cause to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself"

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Well, Andy got scared and left the bar
Walking on home 'cause he didn't live far
You see, Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must have left town
So he went home and finally found
The only thing Daddy had left him, and that was a gun
He went off to Andy's house
Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood, and he started to shake

The Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag 'em down
A big-bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
"Why'd you do it?"

The judge said guilty on a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
He said, "Supper's waiting at home and I gotta get to it"

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
That's one body that'll never be found
You see, little sister don't miss when she aims her gun
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I remember it all very well looking back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one-room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least, we were hard pressed
Then mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancing dress
Well, Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
Then she painted my eyes and lips (Lips)
Then I stepped into a satin dancing dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it had fit me good
Well, standing back from the looking glass
There stood a woman where a half-grown kid had stood

She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
Then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears welling up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, "Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death"
She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said
"To thine own self be true"
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high-heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talking
Asking Mama, "What do I do?"
She said, "Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you"
She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out, well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down now
Your Mama's gonna move you uptown"

Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
It wasn't very long until I knew exactly
What my Mama'd been talking about
I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow
That I was gonna be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might've been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
It wasn't long after a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
And one week later I was pouring his tea
In a five-room hotel suite (Yes, she was)
I charmed a king, congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad (She ain't done bad)

Now in this world
There's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites that call me bad
They criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had
But though I ain't had to worry about nothing
For nigh on fifteen years
Well, I can still hear the desperation
In my poor Mama's voice ringing in my ears

"Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Oh, here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out, well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down, hon'
Your Mama's gonna move you uptown"
Oh, and I guess she did7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I was born 3 months too early
The doctor gave me 30 days
But I must have had my momma's will
And God's amazing grace
I guess I'll keep on living
Even if this love's to die for
Because your bags are packed and I ain't crying
You're walking out and I'm not trying to change your mind
Because I was born to be

The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance
The one who ought to give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor

I don't believe in self-pity
It only brings you down
May be the queen of broken hearts
But I don't hide behind the crown
When the deck is stacked against me
I just play a different game
My roots are planted in the past
Though my life is changing fast
Who I am is who I want to be
The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance
The one who ought to give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor

Oh, a single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stop
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor
But I must have had my mamma's will and God's
Amazing grace

I'm a survivorEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The whole town would be talking
If someone saw you in here with me
I'm telling you I'd understand
If you feel you need to leave
This room rents by the hour
Oh but I've got it all night long
This is the first time that I've asked you here
It ain't the first time that I've done wrong
I need to talk to you
I need to know your words are true
Don't just tell me, show me, give me, all that I need
I need to talk to you
Those pills there on the nightstand
They help make me believe
That the man I'm laying down with
Really cares for me
This book you see me holding
I usually hide in the drawer
I've done my best to put you away
I can't hide from you anymore
I need to talk to you
I need to know your words are true
Don't just tell me, show me, give me, all that I need
I need to talk to you
Oh, I've spent my whole life regretting
Each day that I've spent before
It's time that I face the things that I've done
Oh and that's what I came here for
Cause I need to talk to you
I need to know your words are true
Don't just tell me, show me, give me, all that I need
I need to talk to you

I've known about you for a while now
When he leaves me he wears a smile now
As soon as he's away from me
In your arms is where he wants to be
But you're the one he rushes home to
You're the one he gave his name to
I never see his face in the early morning light
You have his mornings, his daytimes
And sometimes I have his nights

But does he love you? (does he love you?)
Like he loves me (like he loves me)
Does he think of you? (does he think of you?)
When he's holding me
And does he whisper (does he whisper) all of his fantasies?
Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been loving me?

But when he's with me, he says he needs me
And that he wants me, that he believes in me

And when I'm in his arms, oh he swears there's no one else
Is he deceiving me, or am I deceiving myself?
Oh, shouldn’t I lose my temper?
Oh, and shouldn’t I be ashamed?
Cause I have everything to lose
And I, I have nothing to gain

But does he love you? (does he love you?)
Like he loves me (like he loves me)
Does he think of you? (does he think of you?)
When he's holding me
And does he whisper (does he whisper) all of his fantasies?
Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been loving me?

And that he wants me, that he believes in me

Midnight moonlight shining through the curtain lace
Paints a perfect picture on your perfect face
One sweet angel sleeping in my arms
You are the promise I knew God would keep
You are the gift that makes my world complete
And you'll never know how much I love you
But I'll keep on telling you my whole life through
Now I believe in miracles, and you're the reason why
So dream on while I sing you my angel's lullaby1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The greatest man I never knew
Lived just down the hall
And everyday we said hello
But never touched at all
He was in his paper
I was in my room
How was I to know he thought I hung the moon?

The greatest man I never knew
Came home late every night
He never had too much to say
Too much was on his mind
I never really knew him
Well, now it seems so sad
Everything he gave to us took all he had

Then the days turned into years
And the memories to black and white
He grew cold like an old winter wind
Blowing across my life

The greatest words I never heard
I guess I'll never hear
The man I thought could never die
He's been dead almost a year
Oh, he was good at business
But there was business left to do
He never said he loved me
Guess he thought I knew2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She can account for all of the men in her past
Where they are now, who they married, how many kids they have
She knew their backgrounds, family and friends
A few she even talks to now and then
But there is one she can't put her finger on
There is one who never leaves her thoughts
And she thinks his name was John

A chance meeting, a party a few years back
Broad shoulders and blue eyes, his hair was so black
He was a friend of friend you could say
She let his smile just sweep her away
And in her heart, though she knew that it was wrong
But too much wine and she left his bed at dawn
And she thinks his name was John

Now each day is one day that's left in her life
She won't know love, have a marriage, or sing lullabies
She lays all alone and cries herself to sleep
'Cause she let a stranger kill her hopes and her dreams
And all her friends say what a pity, what a loss
And in the end, when she was barely hangin' on
All she could say is she thinks his name was John
She thinks his name was John1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It happened one day near December's end
Two neighbors called on an old friend
And they found his shop so meager and lean
Made gay with thousand bows of green
And Conrad was sitting with face a-shine
When he suddenly stopped as he stitched a twine
And he said "Old friends, at dawn today
When the cock was crowing the night away
The Lord appeared in a dream to me
And said "I'm coming your guest to be."
So I've been busy with feet astir
Strewing my shop with branches of fern
The table is spread and the kettle is shined
And over the rafters the holly is twined
Now I'll wait for my Lord to appear
And listen closely so I will hear
His step as He nears my humble place
And I'll open the door and look on His face
So his friends went home and left Conrad alone
For this was the happiest day he had known
For long since, his family had passed away
And Conrad had spent many a sad Christmas Day
But he knew with the Lord as his Christmas Guest
This Christmas would be the dearest and best
So he listened with only joy in his heart
And with every sound he would rise with a start
And look for the Lord to be at his door
Like the vision he had had a few hours before
So he ran to the window after hearing a sound
But all he could see on the snow covered ground
Was a shabby beggar whose shoes were torn
And all of his clothes were ragged and worn
But Conrad was touched and he went to the door
And he said, "You know, your feet must be frozen and sore
I have some shoes in my shop for you
And a coat that will keep you warmer too."
So with grateful heart the man went away
But Conrad noticed the time of day
And wondered what made the Lord so late
And how much longer he'd have to wait
When he heard a knock, he ran to the door
But it was only a stranger once more
A bent old lady with a shawl of black
With a bundle of kindling piled on her back
She asked for only a place to rest
But that was reserved for Conrad's Great Guest
But her voice seemed to plead "Don't send me away
Let me rest for awhile on Christmas Day"
So Conrad brewed her a steaming cup
And told her to sit at the table and sup
But after she left he was filled with dismay
For he saw that the hours were slipping away
And the Lord hadn't come as he said he would
Then Conrad felt sure he had misunderstood
When out of the stillness he heard a cry
'Please help me and tell me where am I?"
So again he opened his friendly door
And stood disappointed as twice before
It was only a child who'd wandered away
And was lost from her family on Christmas Day
Again Conrad's heart was heavy and sad
But he knew he should make the little girl glad
So he called her in and he wiped her tears
And quieted all her childish fears
Then he led her back to her home once more
But as he entered his own darkened door
He knew the Lord was not coming today
For the hours of Christmas had passed away
So he went to his room and knelt down to pray
And he said "Dear Lord, why did you delay?
What kept you from coming to call on me?
For I wanted so much your face to see.'
When soft in the silence a voice he heard
"Lift up your head for I kept my word
Three times my shadow crossed your floor
And three times I came to your lonely door
I was the beggar with bruised, cold feet
And I was the woman you gave something to eat
I was the child on the homeless street
Three times I knocked, and three times I came in
And each time I found the warmth of a friend
Of all the gifts, love is the best
And I was honored to be your Christmas GuestEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If you see him
Tell him I wish him well
How am I doin'?
Well, sometimes it's hard to tell

I still miss him more than ever
But please don't say a word

If you see him
Oh, if you see him

If you see her
Tell her I'm doin' fine
And if you want to
Say that I think of her from time to time

Ask her if she ever wonders
Where we both went wrong

If you see her
If you see her
Oh, I... I still want her
And I still need him so
Oh, I don't know why we let each other go

If you see her
Tell her the light's still on for her
Nothing's changed
Deep down the fire still burns for him

And even if it takes forever
Say I'll still be here

If you see him
If you see her
If you see him

So you feel like you've run outta hope
Carrying all that weight
Your back's about to break
And you're standing at the end of your rope
You wanna give up the fight
You see no relief in sight
And it's hard to keep the faith
But the darkest night still finds the day

When you think it's the end of the road
It's just 'cause you don't know where the road's leading to
When you think that the mountain's too high
And the ocean's too wide, you'll never get through
Some way, somehow, somehow you do

So you feel like you're right on the brink
Oh, you're in the battlе alone
And life's punched a holе in your soul
Yeah, you've been brought to your knees
But there's better days up ahead
You'll be back on your feet again
And you're gonna be ok
Oh, the darkest night will find the day
When you think it's the end of the road
It's just 'cause you don't know where the road's leading to
When you think that the mountain's too high
And the ocean's too wide
And you'll never get through
Some way, somehow, somehow you do

'Cause it's those times, it's those times when times get bad
You'll find the strength you didn't know you even had
Somehow you'll get through this

When you think it's the end of the road
It's just 'cause you don't know where the road's leading to
When you think that the mountain's too high
And the ocean's too wide
And you'll never get through

Love takes the patience of Job
That's what my Mama always said
Faith is the belief in something more than what you know
That's what the Good Book says
You got to play the cards you got
Who knows what fate is holding
At times you got to go without knowing where you're going

That's why I keep on loving you
I keep on loving you
Through the baby don't-leave-mes
And never-will-agains
And I-promise-tos
I keep on loving you

Lord knows we've had our share of fights
Our sleepless nights, our ups and downs
We've had plenty and then some of baby-I'm-gones and turnarounds
Sometimes I swear it might be easier to throw in the towel
Someday we're going to look back
Say look at us now

That's why I keep on loving you
I keep on loving you
Through the baby don't-leave-mes
And never-will-agains

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
(I watched you die in your sleep)
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
(I was too young for you to lean on me)
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
(You never saw me)
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

Every time I turn the conversation
To something deeper than the weather
I can feel you always shutting down
And when I need an explanation for the silence
You just tell me you don't want to talk about it now
What you're not saying is coming in loud and clear
We're at a crossroads here

If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone

With you, I've always been wide open, like a window or an ocean
There is nothing I've ever tried to hide
So when you leave me not knowing where you're going
I start thinking that we're looking, we're looking at goodbye
How about a strong shot of honesty?
Don't you owe that to me?
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone

Consider me a memory
Consider me the past
Consider me a smile in an old photograph
Someone who used to make you laugh

If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on

Oh, have you looked around
Have you heard the sound
Of Mama's crying
Or do you turn away
When you see the face
Of the innocent dying
In these darkest days
Are you not afraid?
That it's too late

You gotta get down on your knees
Believe, fold your hands, and beg and plead
Gotta keep on praying
You gotta cry, rain, tears of pain
Pound the floor, and scream His name
'Cause we're still worth saving
Can't go on like this, and live like this
We can't love like this
We gotta give this world
Back to God

Have you lost a love?
Do you feel like giving up?
Has your heart been broken?
Are your kids okay?
Will they come home safe?
Do you lie there hoping?
You can make a wish
You can knock on wood
Ohh, it won't do no good
You gotta get down on your knees
Believe, fold your hands, and beg and plead
Gotta keep on praying
You gotta cry, rain, tears of pain
Pound the floor, and scream His name

If I had only known
It was the last walk in the rain
I'd keep you out for hours in the storm
I would hold your hand
Like a lifeline to my heart
Underneath the thunder, we'd be warm
If I had only known
It was our last walk in the rain

If I had only known

I'd memorize each thing you ever said
And on those lonely nights
I could think of them once more
And keep your words alive inside my head
If I had only known

You were the one who always stood beside me
So unaware
I foolishly believed that you would always be there
But then there came a day and I turned my head
And you slipped away
If I had only known
It was my last night by your side
I'd pray a miracle would stop the dawn
And when you'd smile at me
I would look into your eyes
And make sure you know my love
For you goes on and on

I never dreamed of wantin' more
Than a small town, simple life
A little money in our pockets
You’re my husband, I'm your wife
But then I fell in icy water
Standing in the grocery line
I overheard my name and yours
And one I did not recognize

Now everything I thought I knew is walking out the door
There's a bottle on the table tellin’ me the only thing I know for sure

Is there's not a sound, a sound as loud as silence
There's not a blade sharper than a lie
There's not a low lower than being the last one to know
You got a brand new start with someone new
And there's no whiskey stronger than the truth

You never think it'd be your story
When you're pulling the wool off your eyes
You know, you think you know somebody
Then you don't and you don’t know why
Havin’ me another won't make the clock rewind
But I’m drinking every drop, knowing what I'm looking for I'll never find

There's not a sound, a sound as loud as silence
There’s not a blade sharper than a lie
There's not a low lower than being the last one to know
Oh, you got a brand new start with someone new
And there's no whiskey stronger than the truth

The only thing I can do
Is pour a glass and pretend
That this pain's gonna end

There's not a sound, a sound as loud as silence
There's not a blade sharper than a lie
There's not a low lower than being the last one to know
Oh, you got a brand new start with someone new
And there's no whiskey stronger than the truth

Looking back over the years
Of all the things I've always meant to say
But the words didn't come easily
So many times through empty fears
Of all the nights I tried to pick up the phone
So scared of who might be answering

You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

Because the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's one thing that won't change
I know I've tried
The heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
Who can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise
The heart won't lie

Long after tonight
Will you still hear my voice through the radio
Old desires make us act carelessly
Long after tonight, after the fire
After the scattered ashes fly
Through the four winds blown and gone
Will you come back to me?
You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away

Because the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's one thing that won't change
I know I've tried
The heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
Who can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise
The heart won't lie
The heart won't lieEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
