You've come to tell me something you say I ought to know
That he don't love me anymore and I'll have to let him go
You say you're gonna take him, oh but I don't think you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

Women like you, they're a dime a dozen
You can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him, I'd have to move over
And I'm gonna stand right here

It'll be over my dead body, so get out while you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

Sometimes a man's caught lookin' at things that he don't need
He took a second look at you, but he's in love with me
Well I don't know where that leaves you, but I know where I stand
And you ain't woman enough to take my man

Women like you, they're a dime a dozen
You can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him, I'd have to move over
And I'm gonna stand right here
It'll be over my dead body, so get out while you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man
No, you ain't woman enough to take my manEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You wined me and dined me when I was your girl
Promised if I'd be your wife, you'd show me the world
But all I've seen of this old world is a bed and a doctor bill
I'm tearing down your brooder house 'cause now I've got the pill
All these years, I've stayed at home while you had all your fun
And every year that's gone by, another baby's come
There's gonna be some changes made right here on Nursery Hill
You've set this chicken your last time 'cause now I've got the pill
This old maternity dress I've got is going in the garbage
The clothes I'm wearing from now on won't take up so much yardage
Miniskirts, hot pants, and a few little fancy frills
Yeah, I'm making up for all those years since I've got the pill
I'm tired of all your crowing how you and your hens play
While holding a couple in my arms, another is on the way
This chicken's done tore up her nest and I'm ready to make a deal
And you can't afford to turn it down 'cause you know I've got the pill
This incubator is over-used because you've kept it filled
But feeling good comes easy now since I've got the pill
It's getting dark, it's roosting time, tonight's too good to be real
Aw, but Daddy don't you worry none 'cause Mama's got the pill
Oh, Daddy don't you worry none 'cause Mama's got the pillEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hey Louisiana woman, Mississippi man
We get together every time we can
The Mississippi River can keep us apart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
See the alligators all a waitin' nearby
Soon or later they know I'm gonna try
When she wave from the bank don't you know I know
It's goodbye fishin' line see you while ago
With a Louisiana woman waitin' on the other side
The Mississippi River don't look so wide
Louisiana woman, Mississippi man
We get together every time we can
The Mississippi River can keep us apart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
Well I thought I'd been loved but I never had
Till I was wrapped in the arms of a Mississippi man
When he holds me close it feels almost
Like another hurricane just ripped the coast
If he can't come to me, I'm gonna go to him
That Mississippi River Lord, I'm gonna swim
Hey Louisiana woman, Mississippi man
We get together every time we can
The Mississippi River can keep us apart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
Well Mississippi River Lord it's one mile wide
And I'm gonna get me to the other side
Mississippi man, I'm losin' my mind
Gotta have your loving one more time
I'm gonna jump in the river and here go
Too bad alligator you swim too slow
Hey Louisiana woman, Mississippi man
We get together every time we can
The Mississippi River can keep us apart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart
Too much love in this Louisiana heartEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, I was born the coal miner's daughter
In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor, but we had love
That's the one thing that Daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar
My Daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
All day long in the field hoeing corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal-oil light
And everything would start all over come break of morn
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard every day
Why, I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain, there was no need
She's smiled in Mommy's understanding way
In the summertime, we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime, we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail-order catalog
Money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere
Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night, we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler
Well, a lot of things have changed since wayback then
And it's so good to be back home again
Not much left, but the floor
Nothing lives here anymore
Except the memories of a coal miner's daughter2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Precious memories, unseen angels
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger, ever near me
And the sacred scenes unfold
Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious, sacred scenes unfold
Precious father, loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appear
In the stillness of the midnight
Echoes from the past I hear
Old-time singing, gladness bringing
From that lovely land somewhere
I remember mother praying
Father, too, on bended knee
Sun is sinking, shadows falling
But their prayers still follow me
As I travel on life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder, hope grows fonder
Precious memories flood my soulEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You've been making your brags around town
That you've been a-loving my man
But the man I love, when he picks up trash
He puts it in a garbage can
And that's what you look like to me
And what I see is a pity
You'd better close your face and stay out of my way
If you don't wanna go to Fist City

If you don't wanna go to Fist City
You'd better detour around my town
'Cause I'll grab you by the hair of your head
And I'll lift you off of the ground
I'm not a-sayin' my baby is a saint, 'cause he ain't
And that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell you, gal, to lay off of my man
If you don't wanna go to Fist City

Come on and tell me what you told my friends
If you think you're brave enough
And I'll show you what a real woman is
Since you think you're hot stuff
You'll bite off more than you can chew
If you get too cute or witty
You better move your feet, if you don't wanna eat
A meal that's called Fist City
If you don't wanna go to Fist City
You'd better detour around my town
'Cause I'll grab you by the hair of your head
And I'll lift you off of the ground
I'm not a-sayin' my baby is a saint, 'cause he ain't
And that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell you, gal, to lay off of my man
If you don't wanna go to Fist City

You're the reason
I'm riding 'round on recapped tyres
And you're the reason
I'm hangin' our clothes outside on wires
And you're the reason our kids are ugly, little darling
Ah, but looks ain't everything
And money ain't everything
But, I love you just the same
You're the reason
I changed to beer from soda pop
And you're the reason
I never get to go to the beauty shop
You're the reason our kids are ugly, little darling
Oh, but looks ain't everything
And money ain't everything
But, I love you just the same
I guess that we won't ever have
Everything we need
'Cause when we get ahead
It's got another mouth to feed
And that's the reason
My good looks and my figure's gone
And that's the reason
I ain't got no hair to comb
And you're the reason our kids are ugly, little darling
Ah, but looks ain't everything
And money ain't everything
But I love you just the same
Conway, why in the devil don't you gon'
And shave an' put on a clean pair of pants?
Loretta, look at yourself
I wish you'd take them curlers out of your hair
And go put on a little bit of make up
And get out of the housecoat before supper
Ha, well let me tell you somethin', Conway
Considerin' everything I went through today
I look like a movie star
Yeah, Ruth Cassidy
Thank you
Besides that
All of our kids took after your part of our family anyway
Oh they did, huh?
What about the one's that's bald?
Well, I guess you might say they took after meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I've raised my head and set my sail
In the eye of a storm and the belly of a whale
My spirit stood on solid ground
I'll be at peace when they lay me down

When I was a child, I cried
Until my needs were satisfied
My needs have grown up, pound for pound
I'll be at peace when they lay me down

When they lay me down someday
My soul will rise and fly away
This old world will turn around
I'll be at peace when they lay me down

This life isn't fair, it seems
It's filled with tears and broken dreams
There are no tears where I am bound
And I'll be at peace when they lay me down

When they lay me down someday
My soul will rise and fly away
This old world will turn around
I'll be at peace when they lay me down
When they lay me down someday
My soul will rise and fly away
This old world will turn around
I'll be at peace when they lay me down
When I was a child, I criedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Dear Uncle Sam
I know you're a busy man
And tonight, I write to you
Through tears with a trembling hand
My darling answered
When he got that call from you
You said you really need him
But you don't need him like I do
Don't misunderstand
I know he's fighting for our land
I really love my country
But I also love my man
He proudly wears the colors
Of the old red, white and blue
While I wear a heartache
Since he left me for you
{Dear Uncle Sam
I just got your telegram
And I can't believe that this is me
Shaking like I am
For it said, "I'm sorry to inform you..."}EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I just can't get it through my head
You love another now instead
Can't make myself believe we're really through
I'm walking up and down the hall
Talking to a silent wall
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you

I think I've almost lost my mind
I think about you all the time
I'm going crazy, yes I know
And I don't have far to go

The way you treat me is a shame
But I'll keep loving you the same
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you

I keep your letters I should burn
I wear your ring I should return
But there's a million foolish things I do
It makes me cry, but you would laugh
To know I kiss your photograph
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you
I think I've almost lost my mind
I think about you all the time
I'm going crazy, yes I know
And I don't have far to go

The way you treat me is a shame
But I'll keep loving you the same
I'll lose my mind before I'm over youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well you thought I'd be waiting up
When you came home last night
You'd been out with all the boys
And you ended up half-tight
Liquor and love, they just don't mix
Leave a bottle or me behind
And don't come home a-drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind

No, don't come home a-drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind
Just stay out there on the town
And see what you can find
'Cause if you want that kind of love
Well, you don't need none of mine
So don't come home a-drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind

You never take me anywhere
Because you're always gone
Many a night, I've laid awake
And cried here all alone
And you come in a-kissin' on me
It happens every time
So don't come home a-drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind
No, don't come home a-drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind
Just stay out there on the town
And see what you can find
'Cause if you want that kind of love
Well, you don't need none of mine
So don't come home a-drinkin'

They say to have her hair done, Liz flies all the way to France
And Jackie's seen in a discotheque doing a brand new dance
And the White House social season should be glittering and gay
But here in Topeka, the rain is a-falling
The faucet is a dripping
And the kids are a-bawling
One of them a-toddling
And one is a-crawling
And one's on the way
I'm glad that Raquel Welch just signed a million dollar pact
And Debbie's out in Vegas, working up a brand new act
While the TV's showing Newlyweds, a real fun game to play
But here in Topeka, the screen door's a-banging
The coffee's boiling over
And the warsh needs a-hanging
One wants a cookie
And one wants a changing
And one's on the way
Now what was I doing?
Jimmy, get away from there
Darn, there goes the phone
Hello, honey, what's that you say?
You're bringing a few old Army buddies home?
You're calling from a bar? Get away from there!
No not you, honey, I was talkin' to the baby
Wait a minute, honey, the doorbell
Honey, could you stop at the market?
And hello? Hello?
Well, I'll be
The girls in New York City, they all march for women's lib
And Better Homes and Gardens shows the modern way to live
And the pill may change the world tomorrow
But meanwhile today
Here in Topeka, the flies are a-buzzing
The dog is a-barking
And the floor needs a scrubbing
One needs a spanking
And one needs a hugging, Lord
One's on the way
Oh gee, I hope it ain't twins againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Ever since you left me, I've done nothing but wrong
Many nights I've laid awake and cried
We was so happy, my heart was in a whirl
But now I'm a honky tonk girl

So turn that jukebox way up high
And fill my glass up while cry
I've lost everything in this world
And now I'm a honky tonk girl

I just can't make a right with all of my wrongs
Every evening of my life seems so long
I'm sorry and ashamed for all these things you see
But losing him has made a fool of me

So fill my glass up to the rim
To lose my memory of him
I've lost everything in this world
And now I'm a Honky Tonk Girl1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die
Once upon a time there lived a man
And his name was Hezekiah
He walked with God both day and night
But he didn't wanna die
He cried, "Oh Lord, please let me live
Death is close, I know"
God smiled down on Hezekiah
And gave him fifteen years to go
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die
Lord, I wanna go to Heaven
But I don't wanna die
So I long for the day when I'll have new birth
Still I love livin' here on Earth
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die
When Jesus lived here on this Earth
He knew his father's plan
He knew that he must give his life
To save the soul of man
When Judas had betrayed him
Her father heard him cry
He was brave until his death
But he didn't wanna die
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die
Lord, I wanna go to Heaven
But I don't wanna die
So I long for the day when I'll have new birth
Still I love livin' here on Earth
Everybody wants to go to Heaven

Well, if you've been a married woman
And things didn't seem to work out
Divorce is the key to bein' loose and free
So you're gonna be talked about
Everybody knows that you've loved once
They think you'll love again
You can't have a male friend
When you're a has-been or a woman
You're rated X

And if you're rated X, you're some kind of gold
Even men turnin' silver try to make
But I think it's wrong to judge every picture
If a cheap camera makes a mistake
And when your best friend's husband says to you
You've sure started lookin' good
You shoulda known he would, and he would if he could
And he will if you're rated X

Well, nobody knows where you're goin'
But they sure know where you've been
All they're thinkin' of is your experience of love
Oh, their minds eat up with sin
The women all look at you like you're bad
The men all hope you are
But if you go too far, you're gonna wear the scar
Of a woman rated X
And if you're rated X, you're some kind of gold
That even men turnin' silver try to make
But I think it's wrong to judge every picture
If a cheap camera makes a mistake
And when your best friend's husband says to you
You've sure started lookin' good
You shoulda known he would, and he would if he could
And he will if you're rated X

Why, us women don't have a chance
'Cause if you've been married, you can't have no fun at all
No, you're rated X
No matter what you do, they're gonna talk about you
Look down their noses
I, I don't know what to think about it
Just give 'em somethin' to talk about, I guessEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, Portland, Oregon and sloe gin fizz
If that ain't love, then tell me what is uh-huh uh-huh
Well I lost my heart, it didn't take no time
But that ain't all, I lost my mind in Oregon

In a booth in the corner with the lights down low
I was moving in fast she was taking it slow uh-huh uh-huh

Well, I looked at him and caught him looking at me
I knew right then, we were playing free in Oregon

Next day, we knew last night got drunk
But we loved enough for the both of us uh-huh uh-huh

In the morning when the night had sobered up
It was much too late for the both of us in Oregon

Well, sloe gin fizz works mighty fast
When you drink it by the pitcher and not by the glass uh-huh
Hey bartender, before you close
Pour us one more drink and a pitcher to go

How sweet and happy seem those days of which I dream
When memory recalls them now and then
And with what rapture sweet my weary heart would beat
If I could hear my mother pray again
If I could hear my mother pray again
If I could hear her tender voice as then
How glad I would be, would mean so much to me
If I could hear my mother pray again
She used to pray that I on Jesus would rely
And always walk the shining gospel way
So trusting still His love, I'll seek that home above
For I shall meet my mother some glad day
If I could hear my mother pray again
If I could hear her tender voice as then
How glad I would be, would mean so much to me
If I could hear my mother pray againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
