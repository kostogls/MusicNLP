Well I lay my head on the railroad track
Waiting on the "Double E"
But the train don't run through here no more
Poor poor pitiful me

Poor poor pitiful me, poor poor pitiful me
All these boys won't let me be
Lord have mercy on me
Woe woe is me

Well I met a man out in Hollywood
And I ain't naming names
But he really worked me over good
Just like Jesse James

Yes he really worked me over good
He was a credit to his gender
He put me through some changes Lord
Sorta like a Waring blender

Poor poor pitiful me, poor poor pitiful me
All these boys won't let me be
Lord have mercy on me
Woe woe is me
I met a boy in the Vieux-Carres
Down in Yokahoma
He picked me up and he threw me down
Sayin, "please don't hurt me Momma"

Poor poor pitiful me, poor poor pitiful me
All these boys won't let me be
Lord have mercy on me
Woe woe is me

Poor poor poor me
Poor poor pitiful me
Poor poor poor me
Poor poor pitiful me
Poor poor poor me

Don't tell me the reason that you're calling
Is to see if I'm alright since you've been gone
'Cause I know you and I know why we're talking
You're wanting me to say I'm barely hanging on
Well, maybe that was true for a night or two
But now, I got better things to do

I could wash my car in the rain
Change my new guitar strings
Mow the yard just the same as I did yesterday
I don't need to waste my time crying over you
I got better things to do

Maybe when I don't have so much going
Or quite so many irons in the fire
I'll take the time to miss you like you're hoping
But now I can't put forth the effort it requires
I'd love to talk to you, but then I'd miss Donahue
(updated version: but Springer's on at two)
That's right, I got better things to do

I could wash my car in the rain
Change my new guitar strings
Mow the yard just the same as I did yesterday
I don't need to waste my time crying over you
I got better things to do
Check the air in my tires
Straighten my stereo wires
Count the stars in the sky or just get on with my life
I don't need to waste my time crying over you
I got better things to do
I got better things to doEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

So she can't go out tonight again
Her sister's sick
She's gotta baby-sit
Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good excuse
Now you didn't hear any of this from me
But things aren't always what they seem
Brace yourself
This may come as a shock to you
Girls lie, too
We don't care how much money you make
What you drive or what you weigh
Size don't matter anyway
Girls lie, too
Don't think you're the only ones
Who bend it, break it, stretch it some
We learn from you
Girls lie, too
We can't wait to hear about your round of golf
We love to see deer heads hanging on the wall
And we like Hooters for their hotwings too
Other guys never cross our minds
We don't wonder what it might be like
How could it be any better than it is with you
Yeah, girls lie, too
We always forgive and forget
The cards and flowers you never sent
Will never be brought up again
Girls lie, too
Old gray sweatpants turn us on
We like your friends and we love your mom
And that's the truth
Girls lie, too
Yeah that's the truth
Girls lie, too
No, we don't care how much hair you have
Yeah, that looks good
Comb it over like thatEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Last night we went to bed not talking
'Cause we'd already said too much
I faced the wall, you faced the window
Bound and determined not to touch
We've been married seven years now
Some days it feels like 21
I'm still mad at you this morning
Coffee's ready if you want some
I've been up since five
Thinking about me and you
And I've got to tell you
The conclusion I've come to
I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile
I just want to be mad for a while
For now, you might as well forget it
Don't run your fingers through my hair
Yeah that's right, I'm being stubborn
No, I don't want to go back upstairs
I'm going to leave for work
Without a goodbye kiss
But as I'm driving off
Just remember this
I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile
I just want to be mad for a while
I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile

I was sitting in traffic for the fifth year in a row
Wasting my time just to get where I don't even wanna go
I started jotting things down on a Krispy Kreme sack
Everything I'd do if I could leave this place and never look back

I wanna do it all
Visit Paris in the fall
Watch the Yankees play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition, lay down the law
I wanna do it all

I wanna drink tequila down in Tijuana
Say, "why not" when somebody says, "hey do you wanna"
I wanna get my heart broke once or twice
Settle down with the love of my life
Rock little babies to sleep at night

I wanna do it all
Visit Paris in the fall
Watch the Yankees play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition, lay down the law
I wanna do it all
I wanna spend today, every now and then
Just doing what I wanna do
When I wanna do it
(I wanna do it all)
Anytime I wanna do it
(I wanna do it all)

I wanna do it all
Visit Paris in the fall
Watch the Yankees play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition, lay down the law
I wanna do it all

See Niagra Falls, fight City Hall
Feel good in my skin, beating the odds with my back to the wall
Trying to rob Peter without paying Paul
I wanna do it all, I wanna do it all, I wanna do it allEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

How can I believe
That my heart would find someone like you
You see me, the real me
No in bewteens, I had nowhere to hide
You took away the walls around me
Made me feel safe to share my truth
I see the heavens open, a heart that once was broken
Is holding nothing back
Now that I found you
You hold me like a prayer, you touch me everywhere
A lifetime just ain't enough to love you true
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
I do believe we're meant to be
Our chemistry will last forever
And through the years
We'll see some tears
We'll conquer fears
And together we will grow
Looking in your eyes
They tell me
I no longer have to feel alone
I see the heavens open, a heart that once was broken
Is holding nothing back
Now that I found you
You hold me like a prayer, you touch me everywhere
A lifetime just ain't enough to love you true
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
You see me, the real me
You believe in me
I see the heavens open, a heart that once was broken
Is holding nothing back
Now that I found you
You hold me like a prayer, you touch me everywhere
A lifetime just ain't enough to love you true
Now that I found you

Shoulda known it was you knocking on my door
At half past a heartache at quarter to four
Were you starting to worry I was finally getting over you
I almost forgot you looked so fine
If you told me some lies, it would be like old times
Just getting to see you is almost worth the things you do

You're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
You look so good but the way things look ain't the way they are
Better say goodbye
Before this goes too far
Cause now I realize you're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
I got to admit to you got a smile
That really reeled me in for awhile
But it ain't funny, honey, what you put me through
So why don't you send me your photograph
It'd hurt a lot less than taking you back
Then I could still have my favorite part of you

Cause you're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
You look so good but the way things look ain't the way they are
Better say goodbye
Before this goes too far
Cause now I realize you're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
You're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
You look so good but the way things look ain't the way they are
Better say goodbye
Before this goes too far
Now I realize you're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
Now I realize
You're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heartEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Look at us where we are
Just livin' in a field of stars
Just some hearts with some dreams
Runnin' wild like some kings and queens
At the county fair little town somewhere
Sun down fades you get lost in the mid way lights
That look in her eye, you got two tickets to the show called life
What ever you're holdin' in
Let it go, let it disappear in a ring of smoke
Kiss the sky send up a prayer
Where ever you're goin' just go there
Take a look around for a minute
Take a picture in your mind then send it to yourself
'Cause the truth is you and I
We're never gonna be as young as we are tonight
(As young as we are tonight)
Let the words and the sound
Take your feet right off the ground
Let your love light a spark
And watch it burn right through the dark
And hold on tight 'cause it's a hell of a ride
There ain't no need to fight
What ever you're holdin' in
Let it go, let it disappear in a ring of smoke
Kiss the sky send up a prayer
Where ever you're goin' just go there
Take a look around for a minute
Take a picture in your mind then send it to yourself
'Cause the truth is you and I
We're never gonna be as young as we are tonight
So sing out loud (sing out loud)
And raise that beer (raise that beer)
And be damn proud (be damn proud)
That you grew up round here
You got one life you got on chance you got one dance
What ever you're holdin' in
Let it go, let it disappear in a ring of smoke
Kiss the sky send up a prayer
Where ever you're goin' just go there
Take a look around for a minute
Take a picture in your mind then send it to yourself
'Cause the truth is you and I
We're never gonna be as young as we are tonight
As young as we are tonight
What ever your holdin' in (holdin' in)
Let it goEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You were standing at my door
When I came home tonight
And I could tell by the look you gave me
You were needing my advice

You say you want more out of life than he can give you
As a tear rolls down your face
But girl, I've seen the way he looks at you
And I know someone who'd gladly take your place

If I were you
I'd run back home tonight
Tell him everything's alright
Yeah, I know what I'd do
If I were you
I'd never let him go
I'd have someone to hold
My whole life through
If I were you

You shouldn't think you're missing out on something
Because you wear a wedding band
'Cause I can't seem to find somebody
Who wants more than just a one night stand
You know this single life I'm living
Ain't all it's cracked up to be
So you've come to the wrong place
If what you want is sympathy

If I were you
I'd run back home tonight
Tell him everything's alright
Yeah, I know what I'd do
If I were you
I'd never let him go
I'd have someone to hold
My whole life through
If I were you
I'd run back home tonight
Tell him everything's alright
Yeah, I know what I'd do
If I were you
I'd never let him go
I'd have someone to hold
My whole life though
If I were youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the wedding rings
There on display

She smiles and nods her head
As he says, "Honey that's for you
It's not much but it's the best
That I can do"

Golden ring, golden ring
With one tiny little stone
Waiting there, waiting there
For someone to take it home
By itself, by itself
It's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring

In al little wedding chapel
Later on that afternoon
An old upright piano
Plays that old familiar tune
Tears roll down her cheeks
And happy thoughts run through her head
As he whispers low
With this ring I thee wed

Golden ring, golden ring
With one tiny little stone
Shining ring, shining ring
Now at last it's found a home
By itself, by itself
It's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring

In a small two-room apartment
As they fight their final round
He says "you won't admit it
But I know you're leaving town"

She says, "One thing's for certain
I don't love you anymore"
And throws down the ring
As she walks out the door
Golden ring, golden ring
With one tiny little stone
Cast aside, cast aside
Like a love that's dead and gone
By itself, by itself
It's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring

In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the wedding rings
There on displayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I've been looking at you, looking at me
Bet you're thinking that what you get is what you see
But underneath this cool exterior a raging river flows
So before you get any nearer, I better let you know

I'm an emotional girl, I can't help myself
Sometimes I laugh, sometimes I cry
Sometimes I do both and I don't know why
I got a passionate heart and that's just the way things are
You and me could give it a whirl
But I'm warning you boy I'm an emotional girl

I like music that's loud and lights down low
I like driving my car too fast and dancing slow
Some folks may say I'm too extreme 'cause I can't stop once I start
But I never could do anything with half my heart

I'm an emotional girl, I can't help myself
Sometimes I laugh, sometimes I cry
Sometimes I do both and I don't know why
I got a passionate heart and that's just the way things are
You and me could give it a whirl
But I'm warning you boy I'm an emotional girl
I'm an emotional girl, I can't help myself
Sometimes I laugh, sometimes I cry
Sometimes I do both and I don't know why
I got a passionate heart and that's just the way things are
You and me could give it a whirl
But I'm warning you boy I'm an emotional girl

Yeah you and me could give it a whirl
But I'm warning you boy
I'm an emotional girlEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

First it's baseball, arcades in the mall
Skipping out of study hall to hang with the guys
Then it's fast cars, rock and roll guitars
Lighting up behind the barn and not knowing why

But his life is about to change
He's never gonna be the same
And he'll be living in a different world
When boy meets girl

One smile, one look, he's nearly on the hook
Got it bad and feeling good all over inside
He ain't got a clue what he's going through
But he's going to, just give him time

'Cause his life is about to change
He's never gonna be the same
He'll be living in a different world
When boy meets girl

He never polished his boots before
Never thought about what he wore
Never knew he could feel like that
Now there ain't no way he can ever go back
Oh yeah, his life is about to change
He ain't never gonna be the same
And he'll be living in a different world
When boy meets girl

His life is about to change
He's never gonna be the same
He'll be living in a different world

He said goodbye from the edge of the porch
Like she'd been some casual friend
He said "your better off with out me
I'm not what you need"
Like her momma had said about him
He started the car
Pulled out of the drive
Didn't waste any time lookin' back
She watched him go
Thinkin' even a stranger
Would show more compassion than that
She could've cried but she didn't have time
She had a baby to feed
A pink blanket to find
To rock their little one to sleep
She could've laid in bed for hours
Giving misery the power
But she didn't have time
She got a sitter,and she got a job
'cause she had a promise to keep
Her day was a factory and evening survival
At night was exhaustion and sleep
Sometimes she felt life was passing her by
And watching was all she could do
Her friends said "you gotta get outta the house
And maybe you'll meet someone new"
She could've tried
But she didn't have time
She had a five year old to feed
She had ballet class, piano lessons
And t-ball little league
She could've laid awake for hours
Giving lonely nights the power
But she didn't have the time
Not time where would she find the time
To trust a man again
Not time for that flat tire
A crowded parking lot and then
Not time but yes have coffee with the man
Who got her tired fixed
She was thinking gosh he's handsome
When he asked do you have kids
She could've lied
But she didn't have time
All she said was "she's five"
He said "i saw the car seat I love kids
Does she have your eyes?"
And they sat and talked for hours
Giving destiny it's power
She could've been afraid
To fall in love that night
But she didn't have time
She could've been afraid
To fall in love that night
But she didn't have timeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You call and wake me up, the way you always do
Say you miss me and you're sorry, déjà vu
You push the button in the heart you know so well
The wall starts coming down then I remind myself
Everytime I think you might have changed
Put aside the anger and the blame
Make myself believe that there's a way to work it out
Everytime you say let's try again
Begging me to let you back in
Everytime I do, everytime you lie, everytime I cry
If only promises could just erase the past
I could open up my heart enough to take you back
But we've been down that road time and time again
I've learned the hard way how the story always ends
Everytime I think you might have changed
Put aside the anger and the blame
Make myself believe that there's a way to work it out
Everytime you say let's try again
Begging me to let you back in
Everytime I do, everytime you lie, everytime I cry
Everytime I think you might have changed
Put aside the anger and the blame
Make myself believe that there's a way to work it out
Everytime you say let's try again
Begging me to let you back in

Grew up driving on black ice
Spinning in circles under Northern Lights
Laughter steaming, small town dreaming
Digging tunnels in the deep snow
Sheltered from the shiver of a ten below
And I'm right at home
I'm a Northern girl, wild and free
I've got four strong winds to carry me
I've been east to west and all around the world
But I'll always be a Northern girl
Little cottage on a big lake
Sunshine would be a shame to waste
Warm days won't last, come and go fast
Bonfire in the moonlight
People I've known all of my life
That's where I belong
I'm a Northern girl, wild and free
I've got four strong winds to carry me
I've been east to west and all around the world
But I'll always be a Northern girl
Where I come from, what I'm made of
Where I wanna be
You can take me out of there
But you can't take it out of me
Northern girl, wild and free
I've got four strong winds to carry me
I've been east to west
And all around the whole wide world
But I'll always be a Northern girl
I'm a Northern girl, Northern girl
True North, strong and free
Carry me, I'm a Northern girlEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Throwing pictures out the window
Scattered by the way the wind blows
Bye-bye, baby, that's the last I'll see of you
Shoebox full of old love letters
I'll tear each one till I feel better
And I won't look back 'cause I don't like the view
What my heart needs now is rest
So I'm packing up and I'm headed west
My mind's made up, I'll put it to the test
Pushing myself and this old machine
Burning fumes and what's left of my dreams
Let 'em go 'cause I don't need no strings
Just give me a road and a little gasoline
We talked in circles till the words ran out
And it all came down to an angry shout
Before I knew it, I was in third gear and gone
Well, this had been coming for a long, long time
If I said, "I'm sorry," well, I'd be lying
If you think I'll never make it, well, you'd be wrong
What my heart needs now is rest
So I'm packing up and I'm headed west
My mind's made up, I'll put it to the test
Pushing myself and this old machine
Burning fumes and what's left of my dreams
Let 'em go 'cause I don't need no strings
Just give me a road and a little gasoline
What my heart needs now is rest

I want a road stretching out before me
I want a radio in my ear
I want a full tank of absolution
No Fear
I want a rainstorm to pull me over
Then a sky that begins to clear
Towards the truest of destinations
No Fear
Chorus:
I used to hit every wall there was
I used to run away from love
All I ever wanted was right here
But I had to reach way down inside
I had to have faith I'd find
No Fear
I want the world to just keep on turning
I want the dawn in my rearview mirror
I want to hear my own voice singing
No Fear
And when I need two arms around me
And there's no one near
When I'm alone let the only sound be
No Fear
Repeat Chorus
I want peace, love, and understanding
A stogie and an ice-cold beer
Don't wanna live afraid of dying
I used to hit every wall there was
I used to run away from love
All I ever wanted was right here
But I had to reach way down inside
I used to stay up all night long
Wondering what I was doing wrong
All I ever needed was right here
But I had to reach way down inside
I had to have faith I'd find

This white circle on my finger shows I'm free
I'm not sure if that's the way I want to be
Loving you might be a habit I can't break
What a difference this small white circle makes

As I sit here tonight, the jukebox playin'
The tune about the wild side of life
And as I listened to the words you are sayin'
It brings memories when I was a trusting wife

It wasn't God who made honky-tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong

It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame

It wasn't God who made honky-tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrongEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I hear the whispers as I walk by
They always start with 'bless her heart'
She's still single and that's such an empty life
She must not be looking all that hard
They've all got their stories
Of why I'm still alone
But the only truth that matters is my own
I want fireworks to paint the sky
A kiss to burn my lips
I wanna feel the touch that pounds my heart
Down to my fingertips
And twenty years from now
It still won't be as good as it will get
It might be a lot to ask for
But I won't take any less
Just because I won't settle
Don't mean I won't settle down
I don't need a love that I can live with
I want the one I can't live without
Momma's always getting on me
She says I don't give anyone a chance
But if I can't feel the music when somebody holds me
How am I supposed to dance?
There might be a few more lonely nights
But I'm not keeping score
It's worth the wait for what I'm waiting for
Fireworks to paint the sky
A kiss to burn my lips
I wanna feel the flesh that pounds my heart
Down to my fingertips
And twenty years from now
It still won't be as good as it will get
It might be a lot to ask for
But I won't take any less
Just because I won't settle
Don't mean I won't settle down
I don't need a love that I can live with
I want the one I can't live without
And just because I won't settle
Don't mean I won't settle down
I don't need a love that I can live with
I want the one I can't live without
Oh, I can't live withoutEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
