Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can

Tumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawnin' and stretchin' and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...

They let you dream just to watch them shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waiting for the day your ship will come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way
Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life putting money in his wallet
9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it

Back through the years I go wandering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mama put the rags to use

There were rags of many colors, every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Mama sewed the rags together sewing every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of

As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colors that my mama made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me

So with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me
But they didn't understand it for I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love my mama sewed in every stitch
And I told them all the story mama told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes

But they didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
That one is only poor only if they choose to be
Now I know we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me
Made just for me3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you each step of the way

And I will always love you
I will always love you

Bittersweet memories
That's all I'm taking with me
Goodbye, please don't cry
We both know that I'm not what you need

But I will always love you
I will always love you

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
And I wish you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love
And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I can see you're disappointed
By the way you look at me
And I'm sorry that I'm not
The woman you thought I'd be

Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman

So when you look at me
Don't feel sorry for yourself
Just think of all the shame
You might have brought somebody else
Just let me tell you this
Then we'll both know where we stand

My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman

Now a man will take a good girl
And he'll ruin her reputation
But when he wants to marry
Well, that's a different situation
He'll just walk off and leave her
To do the best she can
While he looks for an angel
To wear his wedding band

Now I know that I'm no angel
If that's what you thought you'd found
I was just the victim of
A man that lets me down

No, my mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Here you come again
Just when I'd begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger

Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wondering' how I came to doubt you

All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messing' up my mind and filling' up my senses

Here you come again
Looking' better than a body has a right to
And shaking' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go

All you got to do is smile that smile

I could hold out my arms, say "I love you this much"
I could tell you how long I will long for your touch
How much and how far would I go to prove
The depth and the breadth of my love for you?
From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Love everlasting, I promise you that
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back
I want you to know you can always depend
On promises made and love without end
No need to wonder how faithful I'll be
Now and on into eternity
From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Forever and always, I'll be where you're at
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back
I would blow you a kiss from the star where I sat
I would call out your name to echo through the vast
Thank heaven for you and to God, tip my hat
From here to the moon and back
And I'll spend forever just proving that fact
From here to the moon and back1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Once I had a little dog
I called him Cracker Jack
He had a spot around one eye
That looked just like a patch
His legs were way too long
And he was awkward as could be
He wasn't much to look at
But he looked alright to me
I found him by the river bank
Just wandering about
He was cold and hungry
And his ribs were sticking out
I snapped my fingers, whistled
When he came, I picked him up
I was just a kid
And Cracker Jack was just a pup
I took him home and fed him
'Til he couldn't eat no more
I took him to my room
And put a blanket on the floor
After that beside my bed
Is where he'd always sleep
Each night in my prayers
I'd pray the lord his soul to keep
Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more than that
A playmate, a companion
He was love and understanding
That was Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more than that
Everything a kid could want
I had in Cracker Jack

Cracker Jack would run to meet me
After school each day
He'd jump and wag his tail
And look at me as if to say
"I love you and I've missed you
And I'm glad you're home again"
I knew just how he felt
'Cause me and Cracker Jack was friends
Through the woods and fields
We would often roam about
And when we got in trouble
We would help each other out
I could run almost as fast as Cracker Jack could run
We had a lot in common
And we had a lot of fun
He was always with me
When I was growing up
We shared each other's good times
And we shared each other's love
He only lives in memories now
But often I think back
To the days of childhood
The days of Cracker Jack

Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more than that
A playmate, a companion
He was love and understanding
That was Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more then that
Everything a kid could want
I had in Cracker JackEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Popcorn, soda, box of Raisinets
Velvet-cushioned seats and soft armrests
Best seat in my favorite movie house
Start my dreaming as the lights go out
Up on the silver screen, I picture me
Living out my passions, hopes, and fantasies

I want to be the girl in the movies
The one with the glint in her eyes
The girl that seldom loses
Beautiful, with grace and style
Acting out her story
Standing in her glory
Happy ever after
I want to be the girl in the movies

Wish I had a nickel for each dime I've spent
Watching others live their lives with confidence
Here's a preview of some things to come
It's not too late for me to be someone
I can't keep living in their make-believe
Coming attractions will be starring me
I want to be the girl in the movies
The one with the stars in her eyes (In her eyes)
She gets the roles she chooses
She can laugh or she can cry
Acting in her story
Standing in her glory
Always happy endings
I want to be the girl in the movies

It's time I show the world just what I'm about
I'm steppin' up and I'm steppin' out
I'm feelin' bold and I'm feelin' proud
I want to be that girl

I want to be the girl in the movies
Hmm hmm
I want to be the girl in the movies
Hmm hmm hmm

Gonna stand up
And I'm gonna matter
'Cause I've had enough of my dreams being shattered
And I've had enough of my tears being splattered
I've already been that girl
Oh, I want to be (I want to be)
I want to be (I want to be)
I want to be the girl in the movies
I want to be (I want to be)
Hey look at me (Hey look at me)
I want to be the girl in the movies
I want to shine (I want to shine)
I want to shine (I'm gonna shine)
It's my time
And I want to shine
I want to be happy, I want to be free
Just like the girl in the moviesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Don't try to cry your way out of this
Don't try to lie or I'll catch you in it
Don't try to make me feel sorry for you
Just because I'm blonde
Don't think I'm dumb
'Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool

When you left you thought I'd sit
And you thought I'd wait
And you thought I'd cry
You called me a dumb blonde (Dumb blonde)
Ah, but somehow I lived through it
And you know if there's one thing this blonde has learned
Blondes have more fun

You flew too high up off the ground
It's stormy weather and had to come back down
But I've found new thread for my old spool
Just because I'm blonde
Don't think I'm dumb
'Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool

The bridge, so high
The bridge, so tall
Here is where it started
On the bridge
The moon is big and yellow
And the stars are all a' glow
From the bridge, I see reflections
In the waters far below

You kissed me for the first time here
An' held me awfully tight
And the bridge became our favorite place
We came here often in the night

And one night while standing on the bridge
Desire swept through us both
Passion took us by the hand
And showed us where to go

From the bridge we saw a meadow
So we ran together there
Where we found love together
Our emotions filled the air
The bridge, so wide
The bridge, so long
Where once we stood together
Tonight I stand alone

Tonight, while standing on the bridge
My heart is beating wild
To think that you could leave me here
With our unborn child

My feet are moving slowly
Closer to the edge
Here is where it started
And here is where I'll end it1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me

And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memories like that?
Or do I ever cross your mind?

Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darling
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time
And do you ever miss the feelings
And the love we shared when you were with me, tell me darling
Or do I ever cross your mind

Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two loving arms
That once held me so gentle and close
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memories like that?
Or do I ever cross your mind?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain

All you maidens heed my warning
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
They will vow to always love you
Swear no love but yours will do
Then they'll leave you for another
Break your little heart in two

Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain

If I were a little sparrow
Over these mountains I would fly
I would find him, I would find him
Look into his lying eyes
I would flutter all around him
On my little sparrow wings
I would ask him, I would ask him
Why he let me love in vain
I am not a little sparrow
I am just the broken dream
Of a cold false-hearted lover
And his evil cunning scheme
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
All you maidens fair and tender
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend

Little sparrow, little sparrow
Oh the sorrow never endsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Late one cold and stormy night I heard a dog a-barkin'
Then I thought I heard somebody at my door a-knockin'
I wondered who could be outside in such an awful storm
Then I saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms
Before I could say a word she said, "my name is Sandy
And this here is my puppy dog, its name is little Andy"
Standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress
Then I asked her to come in and this is what she said
"Ain't ya got no gingerbread? Ain't ya got no candy?
Ain't you got an extra bed for me and little Andy?
Patty cake and bakersman, my mommy ran away again
And we was all alone and didn't know what else to do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you?"
Giddy up trotty horse, going to the mill
Can we stay all night?
If you don't love us no one will
I promise we won't cry
London Bridge is falling down
My daddy's drunk again in town
And we was all alone and didn't what we could do
We wondered if you'd let us stay with you?
She was just a little girl, not more than six or seven
But that night as they slept the angels took them both to heaven
God knew little Andy would be lonesome with her gone
Now Sandy and her puppy dog won't ever be alone
"Ain't ya got no gingerbread? Ain't ya got no candy?
Ain't you got an extra bed for me and little Andy?"EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
