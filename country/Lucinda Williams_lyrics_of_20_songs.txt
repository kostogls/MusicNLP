Baby, see how I been living
Velvet curtains on the windows to
Keep the bright and unforgiving
Light from shining through
Baby, I remember all the things we did
When we slept together
In the blue behind your eyelids
Baby, sweet baby
Traced your scent through the gloom
'Til I found these purple flowers
I was spent, I was soon smelling you for hours
Lavender, lotus blossoms too
Water the dirt, flowers last for you
Baby, sweet baby
Tangerines and persimmons
And sugarcane
Grapes and honeydew melon
Enough fit for a queen
Lemon trees don't make a sound
'Til branches bend and fruit falls to the ground
Baby, sweet baby
Come to my world and witness
The way things have changed
'Cause I finally did it, baby
I got out of La Grange
Got in my Mercury and drove out west
Pedal to the metal and my luck to the test
Baby, sweet baby
I been tryin' to enjoy all the fruits of my labor
I been cryin' for you boy but truth is my savior
Baby, sweet baby if it's all the same
Take the glory any day over the fame
Baby, sweet baby1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Sittin' in the kitchen, a house in Macon
Loretta's singing on the radio
Smell of coffee, eggs, and bacon
Car wheels on a gravel road

Pull the curtains back and look outside
Somebody somewhere don't know
Come on now, child, we're gonna go for a ride
Car wheels on a gravel road

Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road

Can't find a damn thing in this place
Nothing's where I left it before
Set of keys and a dusty suitcase
Car wheels on a gravel road

There goes the screen door slamming shut
You better do what you're told
When I get back this room better be picked-up
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road

Low hum of voices in the front seat
Stories nobody knows
Got folks in Jackson we're going to meet
Car wheels on a gravel road

Cotton fields stretching miles and miles
Hank's voice on the radio
The telephone poles, trees, and wires fly on by
Car wheels on a gravel road

Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road

Broken down shacks, engine parts
Could tell a lie but my heart would know
Listen to the dogs barkin' in the yard
Car wheels on a gravel road
Child in the backseat about four or five years
Lookin' out the window
Little bit of dirt mixed with tears
Car wheels on a gravel road

Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel roadEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There's a place in my heart
I got room to spare
There's a place in my heart
I made you room for you there
Even though you make me blue
I've got room enough for you
No matter what you do
I want you to know that
You have a place in my heart

You'll always have somewhere to call home
No matter the circumstances
Wherever you are you're never alone
So don't laugh and say, "what are the chances?"

Will you be welcome and will I let you in
When the sky is raining and thundering
As sure as winter turns to spring
You're asking yourself and wondering

Is there a place in my heart?
Do I have room to spare?
Yeah, there's a place in my heart
I made you room for you there
Even though you make me blue
I've got room enough for you
No matter what you do
I, I want you to know that
You have a place in my heart
Even though you take my love for granted
I'm pretty strong when I admit it
You might be surprised at what I can manage
But don't you ever forget

That there's a place in my heart
I got room to spare
There's a place in my heart
I made room for you there
Even though you make me blue
I've got room enough for you
No matter what you do
I, I want you to know that
You have a place in my heartEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I changed the lock on my front door
So you can't see me anymore
And you can't come inside my house
And you can't lie down on my couch
I changed the lock on my front door
I changed the number on my phone
So you can't call me up at home
And you can't say those things to me
That make me fall down on my knees
I changed the number on my phone
I changed the kind of car I drive
So you can't see me when I go by
And you can't chase me up the street
And you can't knock me off of my feet
I changed the kind of car I drive
I changed the kind of clothes I wear
So you can't see me anywhere
And you can't spot me in a crowd
And you can't call my name out loud
I changed the kind of clothes I wear
I changed the tracks underneath the train
So you can't find me again
And you can't trace my path
And you can't hear my laugh
I changed the tracks underneath the train
I changed the name of this town
So you can't follow me down
And you can't touch me like before
And you can't make me want you more
I changed the name of this town
I changed the lock on my front door
I changed the number on my phone
I changed the kind of car I drive
I changed the kind of clothes I wear

He had a reason to get back to Lake Charles
He used to talk about it, he'd just go on and on
He always said Louisiana was where he felt at home
He was born in Nacogdoches
That's in East Texas, not far from the border
But he liked to tell everybody that he was from Lake Charles

Did an angel whisper in your ear?
And hold you close, and take away your fear?
In those long, last moments

We used to drive through Lafayette to Baton Rogue
In a yellow El Camino, listening to Howlin' Wolf
He liked to stop in Lake Charles because that's the place he loved
Did you run about as far as you could go?
Down the Louisiana highway, across Lake Pontchartrain?
Now your soul is in Lake Charles, no matter what they say

Did an angel whisper in your ear?
And hold you close, and take away your fear?
In those long, last moments
He had a reason to get back to Lake Charles

Told you, baby, one more time
Don't make me sit all alone and cry
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go

I'm like a fish out of water, a cat in a tree
You don't even want to talk to me
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go

He won't take me back when I come around
Says he's sorry then he pulls me out
I got a big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go

See I got a candle and it burns so bright
In my window every night
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go

You don't like to see me standing around
Feel like I been shot and didn't fall down
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go
He won't take me back when I come around
Says he's sorry then he pulls me out
I got a big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go

Turn off the trouble like you turn off a light
Went off and left me, it just ain't right
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go

Around every corner, something I see
Brings me right back how it used to be
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go

He won't take me back when I come around
Says he's sorry then he pulls me out
I got a big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
Well, it's over, I know it but I can't let go
He won't take me back when I come around

You can't depend on anything, really
There's no promises, there's no point
There's no good, there's no bad
In this dirty little joint

No dope smoking, no beer sold after 12 o'clock
Rosedale, Mississippi, Magic City Juke Joint
Mr. Johnson sings over in a corner by the bar
Sold his soul to the devil so he can play guitar

Too cool to be forgotten
Hey, hey, too cool to be forgotten

Man runnin' through the grass outside
Says he wants to take up serpents
Says he will drink the deadly thing
And it will not hurt him

House rules, no exceptions
No bad language, no gambling, no fighting
Sorry, no credit, don't ask
Bathroom wall reads: Is God the answer? Yes
Too cool to be forgotten
Hey, hey, too cool to be forgotten
June bug versus hurricane
June bug versus hurricane
Hey, hey

I had a lover
I thought he was mine
Thought I'd always be
His valentine

Leaning against the railing of a Lake Charles bridge
Overlooking the river, leaning over the edge
He asked me: Would you jump into the water with me
I told him: No way, baby, that's your own death you see

Too cool to be forgotten
Hey, hey, too cool to be forgotten

I know this road like the back of my hand
Same with the stations on the FM band
Farms and truck stops, firework stands
I know this road like the back of my hand
Southern secrets still buried deep
Brooding and restless 'neath the cracked concrete
If you were from here you would defend me to the death
Along with the ghosts of highway twenty
I went through hell when I was younger
Deep in the well you'll see the hunger
To find the strength I've got within me
To wrestle with the ghosts of highway twenty
Been sixty years, I don't want for nothing
But my tears they keep on coming
And my fears continue to haunt me
Along with the ghosts of highway twenty

Who I am now  is who I was then
I knew some how I'd come back again
No doubt about it, I'm next of kin
To all the ghosts along highway twenty
Run down motels and faded billboards
Used cars for sale and rusty junkyards
This two lane blacktop will never let me
Let go of the ghosts along highway twenty
And I have seen the signs that say
We're closing in on the final days
But I got nothing to repent
My saving grace is with the ghosts of highway twenty

Every question, every breath
Every exit leaves a little death
In its wake a memory
That will wander with the ghosts of highway twenty

And I have seen the signs that say
We're closing in on the final days
But I've got nothing to repent
My saving grace is with the ghosts of highway twenty
My saving grace is with the ghosts on highway twenty
My saving grace is with the ghosts on highway twentyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Sun came up it was another day
And the sun went down you were blown away
Why'd you let go of your guitar
Why'd you ever let it go that far
Drunken angel

Could've held on to that long smooth neck
Let your hand remember every fret
Fingers touching each shiny string
But you let go of everything
Drunken angel

Drunken angel
You're on the other side
Drunken angel
You're on the other side

Followers would cling to you
Hang around just to meet you
Some threw roses at your feet
And watch you pass out on the street
Drunken angel
Feed you and pay off all your debts
Kiss your brow taste your sweat
Write about your soul your guts
Criticize you and wish you luck
Drunken angel

Drunken angel
You're on the other side
Drunken angel
You're on the other side

Some kind of savior singin' the blues
A derelict in your duct tape shoes
Your orphan clothes and your long dark hair
Looking like you didn't care
Drunken angel

Blood spilled out from the hole in your heart
Over the strings of your guitar
The worn down places in the wood
The ones that made you feel so good
Drunken angel
Drunken angel
You're on the other side
Drunken angel
You're on the other side

Sun came up it was another day
And the sun went down you were blown away
Why'd you let go of your guitar
Why'd you ever let it go that far

Not a day goes by I don't think about you
You left your mark on me, it's permanent, a tattoo
Pierce the skin and the blood runs through
Oh my baby

The way you move, it's right in time
The way you move, it's right in time
It's right in time with me

I stand over the stove in the kitchen
Watch the water boil and I listen
Turn off the television
Oh my baby

The way you move, it's right in time
The way you move, it's right in time
It's right in time with me

I take off my watch and my earrings
My bracelets and everything
Lie on my back and moan at the ceiling
Oh my baby
Think about you and that long ride
I bite my nails, I get weak inside
Reach over and turn off the light
Oh my baby

The way you move, it's right in time
The way you move, it's right in time
It's right in time with me

It's clear you have a death wish
From what I hear your latest dish lives for you
It scares you half to death
You bend over backwards to make a statement
Hang from the rafters and lick the pavement
Split your lip and barely catch a breath
Your lovely eyes that close like petals
Your sweet surprise can win you medals
You strut your stuff and fan your peacock feathers
Even if you fake it to get attention
Whatever it'll take to get them to listen
Piss on your designer boots and designer leathers
Hey little rock star, why don't you see?
This is not all that it's cracked up to be
And I can't say I blame you for throwin' the towel in
Or buying more fame, cashing your chips in
With all your talent, so much to gain
To toss it away like this would be such a shame
Juvenile delinquent misunderstood
Peter Pan and Robin Hood
Will you ever do things you're afraid to do?
Will you ever know happiness of a rock star?
Was your death wish stronger than you are?
Will you go up in flames like the torches that are carried for you?
Hey little rock star, what don't you see?
This is not all that it's cracked up to be
I can't say I blame you for throwin' the towel in

I think I lost it
Let me know if you come across it
Let me know if I let it fall
Along a back road somewhere
Money can't replace it
No memory can erase it
And I know I'm never gonna find
Another one to compare

Gimme some love to fill me up
Gimme some time, gimme some stuff
Gimme a sign, gimme some kind of reason
Are you heavy enough to make me stay
I feel like I might blow away
I thought I was in Heaven
But I was only dreaming

I think I lost it
Let me know if you come across it

Along a back road somewhere

I just wanna live the life I please
I don't want no enemies
I don't want nothin' if i have to fake it
Never take nothin' don't belong to me
Everything's paid for, nothing's free
If I give my heart
Will you promise not to break it?

If I had my way
I'd be in your town
I might not stay
But at least I would have been around

Cause there's something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk

Does this make sense?
It doesn't matter anyway
Is it coincidence?
Or was it meant to be

Cause there's something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk

And conversation with you
Was like a drug
It wasn't your face
So much as it was your words
And there's something about what happens when we talk
Something about what happens when we talk

I can't stay around
Cause I'm going back south
But all I regret now
Is I never kissed your mouth

You wait in the car on the side of the road
Let me go and stand awhile
I want to know you're there
But I want to be alone
If only for a minute or two
I want to see what it feels like to be without you
I want to know the touch of my own skin
Against the sun, against the wind
I walked out in a field
The grass was high, it brushed against my legs
I just stood and looked out at the open space
And a farmhouse out a ways
And I wondered about the people who lived in it
And I wondered if they were happy and content
Were there children and a man and a wife?
Did she love him and take her hair down at night?
If I stray away too far from you
Don't go and try to find me
It doesn't mean I don't love you
It doesn't mean I won't come back and stay beside you
It only means I need a little time
To follow that unbroken line
To a place where the wild things grow
To a place where I used to always go
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
