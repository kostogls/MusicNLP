You know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget the keys under the mat
When childhood stars shine
Always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your momma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flyin'
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference between sleepin' with someone
And sleepin' with someone you love
"I love you" ain't no pickup line, so
Always stay humble and kind
Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When those dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind (Yeah)

When it's hot, eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the AC and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kind
Don't take for granted the love this life gives you
When you get where you're goin', don't forget turn back around
And help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Runnin round in this new truck
Bank lets me borrow from month to month
I'm runnin out of credit, find a little Cash on the radio
Standin still they're blowin past, numbers on cars goin NASCAR fast
What I wouldn't give for a slow down, don't ya know?
'Cause where I come from, only the horses run
When the day is done, we take it easy

Meanwhile back at Mama's
The porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beer's in the fridge
Red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge
Game's on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss
In a world gone crazy as this

Well I found a girl and we don't fit in here
Talk about how hard it is to breathe here
Even with the windows down can't catch a southern breeze here
One of these days gonna pack it up and leave here
Cause
Meanwhile back at Mama's
The porch light's on, come on in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beer's in the fridge
Red sun sinkin' out low on the ridge
Game's on the tube and Daddy smokes cigarettes
Whiskey keeps his whistle wet
Funny the things you thought you'd never miss
In a world gone crazy as this

Oh I miss yeah a little dirt on the road, I miss corn growin in a row
I miss being somebody everybody knows, there everybody knows everybody
I miss those small town routes, walkin around in muddy boots
The sound of rain on an old tin roof
It's time we head on back

Cause meanwhile back at Mama's
The for sale sign's goin up and I'm gonna
Dump this truck and the little I got
On a loan to own and a three-acre lot
Put supper on the stove and beer in the fridge
Goin' for broke and we're gonna be rich
Watch the sun settin on the ridge
Baby tell me what you think about this
Me and you back at Mama's
Yeah me and you back at Mama's30EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Said I was in my early 40's
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days, lookin' at the x-rays
Talkin' 'bout the options and talkin' 'bout sweet time
Asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya, when you get that kind of news
Man what ya do
And he says

I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

He said I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all the sudden goin' fishing
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I finally read the good book
And I took a good long hard look at what I'd do
If I could do it all again
And then
I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

Like tomorrow was a gift and you've got eternity
To think about what you do with it
What could you do with it, what can
I do with with it, what would I do with it

Sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'
To live like you were dyin'14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Johnny's daddy was takin' him fishin'
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
Holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said, "We can't leave her behind
Son, I know you don't want her to go
But someday you'll change your mind"

And Johnny said:

Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend, Bo
Take anybody that you want as
Long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy, please, don't take the girl

Same old boy, same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in
Front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said, "If you do what I tell you to, there
Won't be any harm"
And Johnny said:

Take my money, take my wallet
Take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister, give it a whirl
But, please, don't take the girl

Same old boy, same sweet girl
Five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one and she
Says, "It's time to go"
Doctor says, "The baby's fine
But you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fadin' fast" and
Johnny hit his knees

And then he prayed:

Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God, please, don't take the girl
Johnny's daddy
Was takin' him fishin'

Roll, won't you come roll with me
Slow, fast, full speed
Girl where ever sweet time takes us
Hang, with me down this old road
Only God knows where we'll go
Don't matter long as I've got your love

I don't ever wanna wake up
Looking into someone else's eyes
With another voice calling me "baby"
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her make up
For a dinner on a Friday night
I don't ever wanna know, no, no, no
No other shotgun rider beside me
Singin' to the radio, ooo, oo

Slide, slide over nice and close
Lay your head down on my shoulder
You can fall asleep, I'll let you
Dream, life ain't nothing but a dream
Don't wanna be, cruisin' through this dream without you
I don't ever wanna wake up
Looking into someone else's eyes
Another voice calling me "baby"
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her make up
For a dinner on a Friday night
No I don't ever wanna know, no, no, no

Bet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back
And I bet you got no idea you're going way too fast
You're trying not to think about what went wrong
Trying not to stop 'til you get where you goin'
You're trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes

I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh, baby

The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do

I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
Yeah, I bet you're bending God's ear talking 'bout me
You're trying not to let the first tear fall out
You're trying not to think about turning around
You're trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
So you sing along
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby

We could have a little double wide planted in an empty field
We could have a big old white picket wrap around on a hill
Don't make a difference to me baby, where the wind takes me, long as I'm with you, girl

I want to drink that shot of whiskey
I want to smoke that cigarette
I want to smell that sweet addiction on my breath
I want to ride across West Virginia in the backseat of a Cadillac
You know some cowboys like me go out like that
So I need you

Like a needle needs a vein
Like my Uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs a rain
I need you like a lighthouse on the coast
Like the father and the son meet the holy ghost
I need you
I want to get lost in some corner booth
Cantina Mexico
I want to dance to the static of an a.m. radio
I want to wrap the moon around us and lay beside you skin on skin
Make love 'til the sun comes up til the sun goes down again
'Cause I need you

Like a needle needs a vein
Like my Uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs a rain
I need you like a lighthouse on the coast

Don't you remember
The fizz in a pepper
Peanuts in a bottle
At ten, two and four
A fried bologna sandwich
With mayo and tomato
Sittin' round the table
Do not happen much anymore

We got too complicated
It's all way over-rated
I like the old and out-dated
Way of life

Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
I love my records
Black, shiny vinyl
Clicks and pops
And white noise
Man they sounded fine
I had my favorite stations
The ones that played 'em all
Country, soul and rock-n-roll
What happened to those times

I am reading Street Slang For Dummies
'Cause they put pop in my country
I want more for my money
The way it was back then

Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
Give me a flat top for strummin'
I want the whole world to be hummin'
Oh, just keep it comin'
The way it was back then

Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw

You always had an eye for things that glittered
But I was far from bein' made of gold
I don't know how but I scraped up the money
I just never could quite tell you no
Just like when you were leavin' Amarillo
Takin' that new job in Tennessee
And I quit mine so we could be together
I can't forget the way you looked at me

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile

When you said time was all you really needed
I walked away and let you have your space
'Cause leavin' didn't hurt me near as badly
As the tears I saw rollin' down your face
And yesterday I knew just what you wanted
When you came walkin' up to me with him
So I told you that I was happy for you
And given the chance I'd lie again
Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile

Got a call from a friend about a friend
With some news no one ever wants to hear
It hit me like a punch, it took my breath
He was just gettin' into his best years
Yeah, somethin' like that'll shake you up
Wake you up

So I stopped off at a Texaco, bought a Slim Jim and a coke
Parked out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grabbed my guitar from the back seat, wrote a song just for me
And I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket
And I called mama

It rang a couple times, and she picked up
I can always hear her smile when I call
I just called to tell you that I loved you
I was missing you and dad and home, that's all
I got to really thinking this morning
About what's important

So I stopped off at a Texaco, bought a Slim Jim and a coke
Parked out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grabbed my guitar from the back seat, wrote a song just for me
And I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket
And I called mama
And from now on
I ain't gonna wait so long

To stop off at a Texaco, buy a Slim Jim and a coke
Park out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grab my guitar from the back seat, write a song just for me
Sing it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I think of home, grab my phone from my pocket
Instead of sayin' tomorrow, I'm gonna

Saw a young Mama laughin' talkin' on the phone
With a little girl workin' on an ice cream cone
Drippin' on her shoes
And I thought about you

Saw a spring break Honda hell-bent for Daytona
The boys in the back hiding their Corona
Like kids do
And I thought about you

I thought about me
I thought about God
Everything love is
And everything it's not

I thought about songs that make us feel better
I thought about faith that ties it all together
I thought about now, then thought about forever
I thought about fire and how we walked through it
The times I got it right, the times I blew it
I thought about real, I thought about good, I thought about true
And I thought about you
I saw "hungry" misspelled on a cardboard sign
And a dirty t-shirt that said "Roll Tide"
So I gave him a few
And I thought about you

Ran into a buddy, he said "How long's it been?"
I said "A couple years," he said "Boy, it's been ten"
That's what time'll do
And I thought about you

I thought about songs that make us feel better
I thought about faith that ties it all together
I thought about now, then thought about forever
I thought about fire and how we walked through it
The times I got it right, the times I blew it
I thought about real, I thought about good, I thought about true
And I thought about you
I thought about you

I thought about me
I thought about God
Everything love is
And everything it's not
I saw a red balloon somebody just let fly
I watched it gettin' smaller up in the sky
For a minute or two

I never had no one, that I could count on
I've been let down so many times
And I was tired of hurtin', so tired of searchin'
Till you walked into my life
It was a feeling, I'd never known
And for the first time, I didn't feel alone

You're more than a lover, there could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer, I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
I don't know where I'd be, without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh yeah

You stand by me, and you believe in me
Like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy, you're right there to save me
You make me see how much I have
And I still tremble, when we touch
And, oh, the look in your eyes, when we make love
You're more than a lover, there could never be another

Gotta hold on easy as I let you go
Gonna tell you how much I love you, though you think you already know
I remember I thought you looked like an angel wrapped in pink so soft and warm
You've had me wrapped around your finger since the day you were born

You're beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl

When you were in trouble that crooked little smile could melt my heart of stone
Now look at you, I've turned around and you've almost grown
Sometimes you're asleep I whisper "I Love You!" in the moonlight at your door
As I walk away, I hear you say, "Daddy Love You More!"

You're beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl

Someday, some boy will come and ask me for your hand
But I won't say "yes" to him unless I know, he's the half
That makes you whole, he has a poet's soul, and the heart of a man's man
I know he'll say that he's in love
But between you and me, he won't be good enough!
You're beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

All my friends call me Bear Claw
The Village Chieftain is my paw-paw
He gets his orders from my maw-maw
She makes him walk the line
You can find me in my wigwam
I'll be beatin' on my tom-tom
Pull out the pipe and smoke you some
Hey and pass it around

'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

I ain't lookin' for trouble
We can ride my pony double
Make your little heart bubble
Lord, like a glass of wine
I remember the medicine man
He caught Running Water in my hands
Drug me around by my headband
Said I wasn't her kind
'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

I can kill a deer or buffalo
With just my arrow and my hickory bow
From a hundred yards don't you know
I do it all the time
They all gather 'round my teepee
Late at night tryin' to catch a peek at me
In nothin' but my buffalo briefs
I got them standin' in line

'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

So proud to live
So proud to dieEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I was twenty and she was eighteen
We were just as wild as we were green, in the ways of the world
She picked me up in that red rag top
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops
On a summer night running all the red lights
We parked way out in a clearing in a grove and the night
Was hot as a coal burning' stove
We were cooking the gas we were had to last

In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl was a mother to be for 2 weeks
I was out of a job and she was in school
Life was fast and the world was cruel
We were young and wild
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down
There would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night
On the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop
Loving me

We took one more trip around the sun
It was all make believe in the end
No I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then
Well, you do what you do and you pay for your sins
And there's no such thing as what might've been
That's a waste of time; drive you outta your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
I was in an old scene

I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped
Loving me
I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped

I need Jesus or I need whiskey
Whatever works best to get me through
Gettin' over you
A little Friday night hallelujah
A congregation of backsliders just like me
Yeah, what I need

Is a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church

Baptize me in that barroom smoke
Bartender, preach to me 'til my heart ain't broke no more
Ain't that what this place is for?
I tried bended knee, hands-up prayin'
But damn did that hurt, don't just keep hangin' around
What I need right now

Is a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church
Just a-sippin' down that unholy water
Save that hurt-like-hell for tomorrow
I'll stay here all night
In a neon church
With the party crowd
Where the good times roll
And the music's loud
Instead of home starin' holes in the ceiling
I got a feeling

I need a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church

Spent forty-eight dollars last night at the county fair
I threw out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me sayin' sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm gettin' in too deep

But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

My Mama and Daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holdin' umbrellas and openin' up doors
I'm takin' out the trash and I'm sweepin' my floors
I'm crossin' my fingers and countin' every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this

'Cause I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
Gotta wash my truck and dress up
To pick her up to watch TV
And she sits down on the sofa, she'll move a little closer
She can't get enough of me

Yeah, I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

Come on, baby
You know what I like
Yeah, I like that
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Hey, don't forget to turn out the lights6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If you're reading this, my Momma's sitting there
Looks like I only got a one-way ticket over here
Sure wish I could give you one more kiss
And war was just a game we played when we were kids

I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up boots
I'm up here with God and we're both watching over you

So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home

If you're reading this
Halfway around the world
I won’t be there
To see the birth of our little girl
I hope she looks like you
I hope she fights like me
Stand up for the innocent and the weak
I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up boots
Tell dad I don't regret that I followed in his shoes

So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home

If you're reading this
There’s going to come a day
When you'll move on
And find someone else
And that's OK
Just remember this
I'm in a better place
Where soldiers live in peace
And angels sing amazing grace

So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
If you're reading this
I'm already home3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
