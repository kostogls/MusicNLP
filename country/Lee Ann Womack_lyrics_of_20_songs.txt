I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat, but always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty-handed

I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance
I hope you dance

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean takin' chances but they're worth takin'
Lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth makin'

Don't let some hell-bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to sellin' out, reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
I hope you dance (Time is a wheel in constant motion)
I hope you dance (Always rolling us along)
I hope you dance (Tell me, who wants to look back on their years)
I hope you dance (And wonder where those years have gone?)

I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

Dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance (Time is a wheel in constant motion)
I hope you dance (Always rolling us along)
I hope you dance (Tell me, who wants to look back on their years)
I hope you dance (And wonder where those years have gone?)
(Tell me, who wants to look back on their years)
(And wonder where those years have gone?)7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I heard he was gonna marry some girl from Denver
Then my sister came over
Had the Sunday paper with her
There was the girl on the social page
Looking in love and all engaged
We decided she don't take a very good picture
It may be my family's redneck nature
Rubbing off
Bringing out unlady-like behavior
It sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger
But I don't like her
She may be an angel who spends all winter
Bringing the homeless blankets and dinner
A regular Nobel Peace Prize winner
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later
I drew horns and blacked out her tooth with a marker
Childish, yes, but she made such a thin little target
I couldn't be happier on my own
But I've got the slightest of a jealous bone
And seeing her with him tends to enlarge it
It may be my family's redneck nature
Rubbing off
Bringing out unlady-like behavior
It sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger
But I don't like her
She may be an angel who spends all winter
Bringing the homeless blankets and dinner
A regular Nobel Peace Prize winner
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later
Inside her head may lay all the answers
For curin' diseases from baldness to cancer
Salt of the earth and a real good dancer
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later
(Spoken)
Well, it was just one tooth
Did I mention I don't particularly care for her?
She makes me sickEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Somewhere deep in bear country
Lives the berenstain bear family
They're kind of furry around the torso
They’re a lot like people, only more so
The bear fact is that
They're just like you and me
The only difference
Is they live in a tree
The berenstain bears
When things go wrong as things might do
The berenstain bears will find a way through
Momma, poppa, sister and brother
Will always be there for each other
The bear fact is that
They can be sweet as honey
Sometimes you'll find
They might be just plain funny
The berenstain bears

Nobody writes goodbye notes
And takes off to God-only-knows on trains anymore
And to tell you the truth
I don't really see much use in walking the floor

Old songs make it sound so cool
To be a half-drunk heartbroke fool
When that fool is you, it's not

And the only way this heartache
Is like an old Hank Williams song
Is the lonely, the lonesome, and the gone

There's a place down by the mall
But it ain't what you'd call a honky tonk
They got a new jukebox
Filled up with country rock
'Cause that's what folks want

I don't know why no one sings about
Drowning in pitchers and half-priced wings
And trying to wish back everything they lost
Yeah the only way this heartache
Is like an old Hank Williams song
Is the lonely, the lonesome, and the gone

He never sang about watching a Camry pulling out
Of a crowded apartment parking lot

But I guess in some ways every heartache
Is like an old Hank Williams song
There's the lonely, the lonesome, and the gone
There's the lonely, the lonesome, and the goneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Ain't it just like one of us
To pick up the phone and call after a couple drinks
And say how you been, I've been wondering if
Maybe you've been thinkin about me
And somewhere in the conversation
An old familiar invitation always arrives
I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight
Everyone's known someone that they
Just can't help but want
Even though we just can't make it work out
The want to, lingers on
So once again, we wind up in each other's arms
Pretending that it's right
And I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight
I know it's wrong, but it ain't easy movin' on
So why can't two friends
Remember the good times once again
Tomorrow when I wake up
I'll be feelin' a little guilty, a little sad
Thinkin' how it used to be before everything went bad
I guess that's what it is all lonely
Late night calls like this, that we try to find
I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight
I may hate msyelf in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You don't know me
But I know who you are
Mind if I sit down?
Do I look familiar?
If I don't, well, I should
I'm sure you've seen me around

I know that you've probably heard my name
Though we've not been introduced
I'm the fool in love with the fool
Who is still in love with you

If you've got a minute
I'll buy you a drink
I've got something to say
It might sound crazy
But last night in his sleep
I heard him call out your name

This ain't the first time, he's done it before
And it's hard to face the truth
I'm the fool in love with the fool
Who is still in love with you
I know love is a fragile thing
And I'm trying hard to make it last
But it ain't easy holding on to my dream
When he's holding on to the past

Just one more thing before I go
I'm not here to put you down
You don't love him and that's a fact
Girl, I've seen you around

You hold his heart in the palm of your hand
And it's breaking mine in two
'Cause I'm the fool in love with the fool
Who is still in love with you
I'm the fool in love with the fool
Who is still in love with youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

How will I ever know what you're feelin'
How will I ever know what to do
If you simply refuse to tell me
What's goin' on inside of you
Have a little faith in me
Baby, can't you see
You've got to talk to me

How can I ever know how to help you
How can I ever know what to say
If every time your heart is hurting
You turn from me and walk away
Have a little faith in me
Baby, can't you see
You've got to talk to me

No, you don't have to lie
Look into my eyes
There's nothing here but love for you
You don't have to feel alone
Let me share the load
There's nothing more I'd rather do
I'm the one you can always turn to
I'm the one who will stand by your side
My love for you is forever
You don't ever have to run away and hide
Have a little faith in me

I've got a two room flat with a view of the bridge
That crosses over into Arkansas
It's pretty to see all lit up at night
Tips are good, waitin' tables at a downtown restaurant
You sound a little surprised that I might be doing all right
Yeah, this is a big town, and I still get lost sometimes
A lot has changed since Montgomery and when you said goodbye
CHORUS:
Looking back at where I was I can see how far I've come
From a nobody with a broken heart to feeling like someone
Now you say you want me back, boy let me tell you this
It's a million miles from Montgomery to Memphis
There's nobody special, I'm not in love
Hasn't been anyone since you
Now isn't that what you wanted to hear me say
No, I've got no plans to be back in Montgomery anytime soon
Sure, we'll get together if you're headed up this way
You can probably make it in half a day or so
But you can't just walk back in again
Got a long, long way to go

Dad used to own the hardware store
But now it and him ain’t around no more
Don’t know the whole story but I’ve overheard some
I know he’s who I got my drinking from
Jesus can you save me
From going crazy
I need some help getting out of this town
Are there any answers
Up in the hereafter
Oh if you got something won’t you send it on down
While I’m still able to be found
Guys around here want a girl who’s rich
Even if I was I wouldn’t be no catch
But this ain’t where I’ll be settling down
I wanna be gone when the fall rolls around
Jesus can you save me
From going crazy
I need some help getting out of this town
Are there any answers
Up in the hereafter
Oh if you got something won’t you send it on down
While I’m still able to be found
Sitting in the bleachers at the football field
Got a pretty good buzz from a quart I just killed
It’s a cold sunday morning and the church bells ring
I can just about hear all the good folks sing
Jesus can you save me
From going crazy
I need some help getting out of this town
Are there any answers
Up in the hereafter
Oh if you got something won’t you send it on down
While I’m still able to be found

Lord, I hope this day is good
I'm feelin empty and misunderstood
I should be thankful, Lord, I know I should
But Lord I hope this day is good
Lord, have you forgotten me?
I been prayin to you faithfully
I should be thankful Lord you know I am
But Lord I hope you understand
I don't need fortune and I don't need fame
Send down the thunder, Lord, send down the rain
But when you're plannin just how it will be
Plan a good day for me
Lord, I hope this day is good
I'm feelin empty and misunderstood
I should be thankful, Lord, I know I should
But Lord I hope this day is good
You've been the king since the dawn of time
All that I'm askin is a little less crime
It might be hard for the devil to do
But it would be easy for you

I had forgotten just what love felt like
And in that motel room, all my senses came to life
All the passion in his touch
And I knew I could, never get enough
But the worst part of doing what I never should have done
Is that I know, there's more where that came from
In the darkness, there's a distance as I lie here every night
And I beg the Lord, please won't you get this cheatin' off my mind
But then he'll call to say, that he sure had fun
Just so I'll know, there's more where that came from
My guilty conscience can't kill my heart's desire
Just like a drop of rain can't put out a raging fire
Oh, the price I'm paying now
Is a secret that I'm forced to carry around
But the worst part of doing what I never should have done
Is that I know, there's more where that came from
In the darkness, there's a distance as I lie here every night
And I beg the Lord, please won't you get this cheatin' off my mind
And then he'll call to say, that he sure had fun

Yes, I'm afraid, there's more where that came fromEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I recognized your number
It's burned into my brain
Felt my heart beating faster
Every time it rang
Some things never change
That's why I didn't answer

I bet you're in a bar
Listening to a country song
Glass of Johnny Walker Red
With no one to take you home
They're probably closing down
Saying, "No more alcohol"
I bet you're in a bar
Cause I'm always your last call

I don't need to check that message
I know what it says
"Baby, I still love you"
Don't mean nothing when there's whiskey on your breath
That's the only love I get
So if you're calling...
I bet you're in a bar
Listening to a cheatin' song
Glass of Johnny Walker Red
With no one to take you home
They're probably closing down
Saying, "No more alcohol"
I bet you're in bar
Cause I'm always your last

Call me crazy but
I think maybe
We've had our last call

I bet you're in a bar
It's always the same old song
That Johnny Walker Red
By now it's almost gone
But baby, I won't be there
To catch you when you fall
I bet you're in bar
Cause I'm always your last call1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Better take a good look before I disappear
Because I'm just about to be your used-to-be
You might catch a glimpse of my tail lights in the dust
And if you notice somethin' missin' well it's me
'Cause I tried a new life
I cried and you stood by
Well here's a little magic thing I do...
Chorus:
Now you see me, now you don't
First you do, but then you won't
Watch me vanish right before your eyes
You might think you see me there
In a cafe on a street somewhere
Yeah that might be me, but I'll be gone
Now you see me, now you don't
You ever get the feeling that it feels like deja vu
Because some stranger feels like someone that you know
Might be the color of her lipstick or the smell of her perfume
That sends a shiver all the way down to your toes
Don't blink 'cause it ain't...
Yeah... what you think
It's just your heart playin' tricks on you
Chorus:
Now you see me, now you don't
First you do, but then you won't
Watch me vanish right before your eyes
You might think you see me there
In a cafe on a street somewhere
Yeah that might be me, but I'll be gone
Now you see me, now you don't
Yeah...

You got a lot of glitter in your pocket
A title on your name
A big-timin' life you'd love to wish away
Is it worth the climb just for the high
You wonder why sometimes, you wonder why
Come on
Get down

Come on, get down to the barely-gettin'-by
Back down where the well's run dry
There's a whole lot of lovin', the livin' comes cheap
Down at the bottom of the barrel with me
Come on
Get down
Come on, get down

So you miss the bliss of waitin' on nothin'
Knowing everybody's name
Simply to like driftin' before it was in vain
Ain't it worth the fall to lose it all?
All that weight on your heart
Listen to your spirit call
Come on

Come on, get down to the barely-gettin'-by
Back down where the well's run dry
There's a whole lot of lovin', the livin' comes cheap

I had to leave my life in Dallas
That town will always be you
And in every crowd on every corner
In every face I'd see you
So with nothing more than a tank of gas
I drove away without looking back
And I guess that's how I got where I am
Going anywhere as fast as I can
Now I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead
Too late to change my mind
I've got to keep my heart out of this
And both hands on the wheel
I'm learning more with every mile
Just how leaving feels
It's a lonely stretch of blacktop
Out into the blue
Don't know where I'll go
Or what I'll do
I'm a little past Little Rock
But a long way from over you
These headlights on the highway
Disappear into the dark
And if I could have it my way
I'd go back to where you are
Oh, but I can't turn this thing around
And nothing short of the breaking down
Is gonna get me off this road I'm on
But I'm still a far cry from gone
Now I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead
Too late to change my mind
I've got to keep my heart out of this
And both hands on the wheel
I'm learning more with every mile
Just how leaving feels
It's a lonely stretch of blacktop
Out into the blue
Don't know where I'll go

I ain't got much to go on, just a box of photographs
And every picture tells a story, but every story has two halves
I keep 'em separate in before-and-after piles
Somewhere in the middle is where mama lost her smile

Somewhere in the summer back in 1982
Daddy took a job in town and we all had to move
I feel like there's one missing, I've felt it for a while
One that's gonna tell me, how mama lost her smile

But you don't take pictures of the bad times
We only wanna remember all the sunshine
We don't live in pictures, this is real life
And they're about as different as black and white

I don't know why it matters, I just know it does
It's not like it'll change things to find out what it was
She would never tell us that just ain't her style
But I wish I knew the reason why mama lost her smile

But you don't take pictures of the bad times
We only wanna remember all the sunshine
We don't live in pictures, this is real life
And they're about as different as black and white
We're all a little older and we're all a little worn
We're all a little faded and we're all a little torn

But you don't take pictures of the bad times
We only wanna remember all the sunshine

Once more I'll let you back in
I know how the story ends
But I can't help myself
You'll break my heart I know
Through my tears I watch you go
Then just like it's always been
I'll say never again, again
Each time you leave
I say I've had enough
But I must be addicted
To your kind of love
I swear to myself
I'm gonna stand my ground
But one look at you
Breaks my defenses down
And here comes never again, again
Once more I'll let you back in

Either way you play it

And a couple drops of rain
Then the storm and the wind
And the thunder and the lightning came
Somebody give me shelter

Last night, I went out, walkin'
I could not believe my eyes
I could tell that she wasn't some stranger;
You held her a little too tight
My heart stopped like it hit a freight train
You kissed her, and twisted the knife
Now you're tryin' to tell me she's nothin';
Why should I be so suprised?
Losers lose, winners win;
Cheaters cheat, singers sing
Dreamers dream, cryers cry;
Fools believe, and Liars Lie
It'll take all I got to forgive you
As sure as my heart starts to mend
I'd find you somewhere with another
You'd hurt me all over again
Losers lose, winners win, cheaters cheat, and singers sing;
Dreamers dream, cheaters cheat, fools believe, and Liars Lie
I should've known, I should've known, I should've known:
Someone like you, who can't be true, is bound to wrong
Losers lose, winners win;
Ceaters cheat, and singers sing;
Dreamers dream, cryers cry;
Fools believe, and Liars LieEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
