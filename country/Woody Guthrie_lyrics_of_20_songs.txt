This land is your land, and this land is my land
From the California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

As I went walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
I saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

I've roamed and rambled, and I've followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
All around me a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

When the sun comes shining as I was strolling
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
The fog was lifting a voice come chanting
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

As I was walkin' - I saw a sign there
And that sign said "No trespassin'"
But on the other side .... it didn't say nothin!
Now that side was made for you and me!

This land is your land, and this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me
In the squares of the city - In the shadow of the steeple
Near the relief office - I see my people
And some are grumblin' and some are wonderin'
If this land's still made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

Nobody living can ever stop me
As I go walking that freedom highway;
Nobody living can ever make me turn back
This land was made for you and me6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There's a great and a bloody fight
'round this whole world tonight
And the battle, the bombs and shrapnel reign
Hitler told the world around he would tear our union down
But our union's gonna break them slavery chains
Our union's gonna break them slavery chains
I walked up on a mountain in the middle of the sky
Could see every farm and every town
I could see all the people in this whole wide world
That's the union that'll tear the fascists down, down, down
That's the union that'll tear the fascists down
When I think of the men and the ships going down
While the Russians fight on across the Don
There's London in ruins and Paris in chains
Good people, what are we waiting on?
Good people, what are we waiting on?
So, I thank the Soviets and the mighty Chinese vets
The Allies the whole wide world around
To the battling British, thanks, you can have ten million Yanks
If it takes 'em to tear the fascists down, down, down
If it takes 'em to tear the fascists down
But when I think of the ships and the men going down
And the Russians fight on across the Don
There's London in ruins and Paris in chains
Good people, what are we waiting on?
Good people, what are we waiting on?
So I thank the Soviets and the mighty Chinese vets
The Allies the whole wide world around
To the battling British, thanks, you can have ten million Yanks
If it takes 'em to tear the fascists down, down, down
If it takes 'em to tear the fascists downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Show me a woman that a man can trust
Snakes on the desert and fish in the sea
A rattlesnake mama made a sucker out of me
O tell me how long must I have to wait?
Can I get you now or must I hesitate?
Bacon to bacon and beans to beans
I got a cornbread mama in New Orleans
Turtles in the rivers, alligators in the swamp
A Louisiana mama keeps a man on the jump
O tell me how long must I have to wait...
It's beer to beer and ale to ale
I got a L.A. mama in the Frisco Jail
Gold in the mountains, copper in the hills
They caught my gal with a forty gallon still
O tell me how long must I have to wait...
Ham to ham and eggs to eggs
If I don't get a pension I'll have to beg
There's a lot of crooked politician men;
It would be all right if it wasn't for them
O tell me how long must I have to wait...
I tried to get a job all over town;
Seven hundred places they turned me down
They told me six weeks I could get relief
But I ain't got a bite to eat
O tell me how long must I have to wait...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Lots of folks back East, they say, is leavin' home every day
Beatin' the hot old dusty way to the California line
'Cross the desert sands they roll, gettin' out of that old dust bowl
They think they're goin' to a sugar bowl, but here's what they find
Now, the police at the port of entry say
"You're number fourteen thousand for today"

Oh, if you ain't got the do re mi, folks
You ain't got the do re mi
Why, you better go back to beautiful Texas
Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee
California is a garden of Eden
A paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not, you won't find it so hot
If you ain't got the do re mi

You want to buy you a home or a farm, that can't deal nobody harm
Or take your vacation by the mountains or sea
Don't swap your old cow for a car, you better stay right where you are
You better take this little tip from me
'Cause I look through the want ads every day
But the headlines on the papers always say

Go to sleep you weary hobo
Let the towns drift slowly by
Can't you hear the steel rails hummin'
That's the hobo's lullaby
I know your clothes are torn and ragged
And your hair is turning gray
Lift your head and smile at trouble
You'll find peace and rest someday
Now don't you worry 'bout tomorrow
Let tomorrow come and go
Tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar
Safe from all that wind and snow
I know the police cause you trouble
They cause trouble everywhere
But when you die and go to Heaven
You'll find no policemen there
So go to sleep you weary hobo
Let the towns drift slowly by
Listen to the steel rails hummin'
That's a hobo's lullaby1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I ain't got no home, I'm just a-roamin' 'round
Just a wandrin' worker, I go from town to town
And the police make it hard wherever I may go
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore
My brothers and my sisters are stranded on this road
A hot and dusty road that a million feet have trod
Rich man took my home and drove me from my door
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore
Was a-farmin' on the shares, and always I was poor
My crops I lay into the banker's store
My wife took down and died upon the cabin floor
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore
I mined in your mines and I gathered in your corn
I been working, mister, since the day I was born
Now I worry all the time like I never did before
Cause I ain't got no home in this world anymore

The crops are all in and the peaches are rotting
The oranges are filed in their creosote dumps
They're flying 'em back to the Mexico border
To take all their money to wade back again
Goodbye to my Juan, farewell Roselita
Adios mes amigos, Jesus e Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be deportees
My father's own father, he waded that river
They took all the money he made in his life
It's six hundred miles to the Mexico border
And they chased them like rustlers, like outlaws, like thieves
The skyplane caught fire over Los Gatos Canyon
The great ball of fire it shook all our hills
Who are these dear friends who are falling like dry leaves?
Radio said, "They are just deportees"
Is this the best way we can grow our big orchards?
Is this the best way we can raise our good crops?
To fall like dry leaves and rot on out topsoil
And be known by no names except "deportees"EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If you'll gather 'round me, children
A story I will tell
'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw
Oklahoma knew him well
It was in the town of Shawnee
A Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode
There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Vulgar words of anger
And his wife she overheard
Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
And the deputy grabbed his gun
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down
Yes, he took to the trees and timber
To live a life of shame
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name
But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes
Others tell you 'bout a stranger
That come to beg a meal
Underneath his napkin
Left a thousand-dollar bill
It was in Oklahoma City
It was on a Christmas day
There was a whole car load of groceries
Come with a note to say
"Well, you say that I'm an outlaw
You say that I'm a thief
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief"
Yes, as through this world I've wandered
I've seen lots of funny men
Some will rob you with a six-gun
And some with a fountain pen
And as through your life you travel
Yes, as through your life you roam
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Tom Joad got out of the old McAlester Pen
There he got his parole
After four long years on a man killing charge
Tom Joad come a-walkin' down the road, poor boy
Tom Joad come a-walkin' down the road
Tom Joad, he met a truck driving man
There he caught him a ride
He said, "I just got loose from McAlester Pen
On a charge called homicide
A charge called homicide"
That truck rolled away in a cloud of dust
Tommy turned his face toward home
He met Preacher Casey, and they had a little drink
But they found that his family they was gone
He found that his family they was gone
He found his mother's old-fashioned shoe
Found his daddy's hat
And he found little Muley and Muley said
"They've been tractored out by the cats
They've been tractored out by the cats"
Tom Joad walked down to the neighbor's farm
Found his family
They took Preacher Casey and loaded in a car
And his mother said, "We've got to get away"
His mother said, "We've got to get away"
Now, the twelve of the Joads made a mighty heavy load
But Grandpa Joad did cry
He picked up a handful of land in his hand
Said: "I'm stayin' with the farm till I die
Yes, I'm stayin' with the farm till I die"
They fed him short ribs and coffee and soothing syrup
And Grandpa Joad did die
They buried Grandpa Joad by the side of the road
Grandma on the California side
They buried Grandma on the California side
They stood on a mountain and they looked to the west
And it looked like the promised land
That bright green valley with a river running through
There was work for every single hand, they thought
There was work for every single hand

The Joads rolled away to the jungle camp
There they cooked a stew
And the hungry little kids of the jungle camp
Said: "We'd like to have some, too"
Said: "We'd like to have some, too"
Now a deputy sheriff fired loose at a man
Shot a woman in the back
Before he could take his aim again
Preacher Casey dropped him in his track, poor boy
Preacher Casey dropped him in his track
They handcuffed Casey and they took him in jail
And then he got away
And he met Tom Joad on the old river bridge
And these few words he did say, poor boy
These few words he did say
"I preached for the Lord a mighty long time
Preached about the rich and the poor
Us workin' folkses, all get together
Cause we ain't got a chance anymore
We ain't got a chance anymore"
Now, the deputies come, and Tom and Casey run
To the bridge where the water run down
But the vigilante thugs hit Casey with a club
They laid Preacher Casey on the ground, poor Casey
They laid Preacher Casey on the ground
Tom Joad, he grabbed that deputy's club
Hit him over the head
Tom Joad took flight in the dark rainy night
And a deputy and a preacher lying dead, two men
A deputy and a preacher lying dead
Tom run back where his mother was asleep
He woke her up out of bed
An' he kissed goodbye to the mother that he loved
Said what Preacher Casey said, Tom Joad
He said what Preacher Casey said
"Everybody might be just one big soul
Well it looks that a-way to me
Everywhere that you look, in the day or night
That's where I'm a-gonna be, Ma
That's where I'm a-gonna be
Wherever little children are hungry and cry
Wherever people ain't free
Wherever men are fightin' for their rights
That's where I'm a-gonna be, Ma
That's where I'm a-gonna be"EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

On the 14th day of April of 1935
There struck the worst of dust storms that ever filled the sky
You could see that dust storm comin', the cloud looked deathlike black
And through our mighty nation, it left a dreadful track
From Oklahoma City to the Arizona line
Dakota and Nebraska to the lazy Rio Grande
It fell across our city like a curtain of black rolled down
We thought it was our judgement, we thought it was our doom
The radio reported, we listened with alarm
The wild and windy actions of this great mysterious storm
From Albuquerque and Clovis, and all New Mexico
They said it was the blackest that ever they had saw
From old Dodge City, Kansas, the dust had rung their knell
And a few more comrades sleeping on top of old Boot Hill
From Denver, Colorado, they said it blew so strong
They thought that they could hold out, but they didn't know how long
Our relatives were huddled into their oil boom shacks
And the children they was cryin' as it whistled through the cracks
And the family it was crowded into their little room
They thought the world had ended, and they thought it was their doom
The storm took place at sundown, it lasted through the night
When we looked out next morning, we saw a terrible sight
We saw outside our window where wheat fields they had grown
Was now a rippling ocean of dust the wind had blown
It covered up our fences, it covered up our barns
It covered up our tractors in this wild and dusty storm
We loaded our jalopies and piled our families in
We rattled down that highway to never come back againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We’ll end this world of slavery
Before this battle’s won

Down in your bigtrees knowing no fear

Fell by your gun, yes

For more than three hundred nazis fell by your gun

I've sung this song, but I'll sing it again
Of the place that I lived on the wild windy plains
In the month called April, county called Gray
And here's what all of the people there say:
(Chorus)
So long, it's been good to know yuh;
So long, it's been good to know yuh;
So long, it's been good to know yuh
This dusty old dust is a-gettin' my home
And I got to be driftin' along
A dust storm hit, an' it hit like thunder;
It dusted us over, an' it covered us under;
Blocked out the traffic an' blocked out the sun
Straight for home all the people did run
Singin':
(Chorus)
We talked of the end of the world, and then
We'd sing a song an' then sing it again
We'd sit for an hour an' not say a word
And then these words would be heard:
(Chorus)
Sweethearts sat in the dark and sparked
They hugged and kissed in that dusty old dark
They sighed and cried, hugged and kissed
Instead of marriage, they talked like this:
"Honey..."
(Chorus)
Now, the telephone rang, an' it jumped off the wall
That was the preacher, a-makin' his call
He said, "Kind friend, this may be the end;
An' you got your last chance of salvation of sin!"
The churches was jammed, and the churches was packed
An' that dusty old dust storm blowed so black
Preacher could not read a word of his text
An' he folded his specs, an' he took up collection
Said:

Take a trip with me in 1913
To Calumet, Michigan, in the copper country
I will take you to a place called Italian Hall
Where the miners are having their big Christmas ball
I will take you in a door and up a high stairs
Singing and dancing is heard everywhere
I will let you shake hands with the people you see
And watch the kids dance around the big Christmas tree
You ask about work and you ask about pay
They'll tell you they make less than a dollar a day
Working the copper claims, risking their lives
So it's fun to spend Christmas with children and wives
There's talking and laughing and songs in the air
And the spirit of Christmas is there everywhere
Before you know it you're friends with us all
And you're dancing around and around in the hall
Well a little girl sits down by the Christmas tree lights
To play the piano so you gotta keep quiet
To hear all this fun you would not realize
That the copper boss' thug men are milling outside
The copper boss' thugs stuck their heads in the door
One of them yelled and he screamed, "there's a fire!"
A lady she hollered, "there's no such a thing
Keep on with your party, there's no such thing."
A few people rushed and it was only a few
"It's just the thugs and the scabs fooling you,"
A man grabbed his daughter and carried her down
But the thugs held the door and he could not get out
And then others followed, a hundred or more
But most everybody remained on the floor
The gun thugs they laughed at their murderous joke
While the children were smothered on the stairs by the door
Such a terrible sight I never did see
We carried our children back up to their tree
The scabs outside still laughed at their spree
And the children that died there were seventy-three
The piano played a slow funeral tune
And the town was lit up by a cold Christmas moon
The parents they cried and the miners they moaned
"See what your greed for money has done."
