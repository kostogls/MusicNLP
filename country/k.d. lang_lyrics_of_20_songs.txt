Even through the darkest phase
Be it thick or thin
Always someone marches brave
Here beneath my skin

And constant (Constant)
Craving (Craving)

Maybe a great magnet pulls
All souls to what's true
Or maybe it is life itself
Feeds wisdom to its youth

Ah, constant craving

I heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
You don't really care for music, do ya?
Well it goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
Well she tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and cut your hair
And from your lips she drew Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked the floor
Used to live alone before I knew ya
But I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Our love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
It's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not someone who's seen the light
It's a cold and broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Just a kiss, just a kiss
I have lived just for this
I can't explain why I've become
Miss Chatelaine
Just a smile, just a smile
Hold me captive just a while
I can't explain why I've become
Miss Chatelaine
Every time your eyes meet mine
Clouds of qualm
Burst into sunshine
Just a sigh, just a sigh
Words my love just reply
I can't explain why I've become
Miss Chatelaine
Miss Chatelaine
Zing!!!
Just a smile, just a smile
Hold me captive just a while
I can't explain why I've become
Miss Chatelaine
Every time your eyes meet mine
Clouds of qualm
Burst into sunshine
Just a kiss, just a kiss
I have lived just for this
I can't explain why I've become

As things start to surface
And tears come on down
The scars of childhood
In a small town
The hurt she pushed inward
Is starting to show
Now she'll do some talking
But he'll never know
The tables have turned now
With a child of her own
But she's blind to the difference
What's taught is what's known
Numbed by reaction
And stripped of the trust
A young heart is broken
Not aware that it's just
A family tradition
The strength of this land
Where what's right and wrong
Is the back of a hand
Turns girls into women
And a boy to a man
The rights of the children
Have nowhere to stand
The memories of children
Are written in stone
And some they get buried
Not to be shown
But still they do linger
Deep down inside
Like a seed that's been planted
And won't be deniedEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There is a town in north Ontario
With dream comfort memory to spare
And in my mind
I still need a place to go
All my changes were there
Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows in our eyes
Leaves us
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless

Baby, can you hear me now?
The chains are locked
And tied around my door
And, baby, will you sing with me somehow
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless

Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows in our eyes
Leaves us
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helplessEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Save me
Save me from you
But pave me
The way to you
Lead me upon the captive free
Gracious and tame like love can be
Lead me upon
Spoil me
Spoil me with you
And sell me with the world of you
Watch over me with a mother's eyes
Judging my worth only to glorify
Watch over me
Save me save me
Save me save me
Carry
Carry me through
And bury all my doubts of you
Clothe my desire with spell or prayer
I'll shroud every sign of need I swear
Clothe my desire
Save me save me
Save me save me
Save me save me
Save me save meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You swim
Swim through my veins
Drown me
In your reign
My desire
Carries no shame
My will
Will harbour no pain
Wash
Wash me clean
Mend my wounded seams
Cleanse my tarnished dreams
Drink
Drink from my spell
Quench
Love's drying well
Wash
Wash me clean
Mend my wounded seams
Cleanse my tarnished dreamsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Flawless light in a darkening air
Alone...and shining there
Love will not elude you
Love is simple
I worship this tenacity
And the beautiful struggle we're in
Love will not elude us
Love is simple
Be sure to know that
All in love
Is ours
And love, as a philosophy
Is simple
I am calm in oblivion
Calm, as i ever have been
Love will not elude me
Love is simple
Be sure to know that
All in love
Is ours...
Is ours...
That all in love
Is ours
And love, as philosophy
Is simple...
And ours...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I know a place
Pretty as pie
Out where the riverbend
Hits up with the end of the sky
It's left of Nebraska
And over a crest
On a little patch of heaven
Way out west

Ev'rything's green
Know what I mean?
Darlin', it's quite the sweetest sight
Thatcha ever done seen
Ain't nothin' much out there
Just life at its best
On that little patch of heaven
Way out west

Bees by the dozen
Are buzzin' real peaceful
Ev'ry bluebonnet
Doggone it, smells nice
Even the tumblin' tumbleweed
Slows down to match yer speed
On my tiny half-an-acre
Of paradise

Ev'ry which way
Buttercups sway
Out on the hills, the daffodils
Are enjoyin' the day
What could be better
Than settin' to rest
On a little patch of heaven
Way out west

Hummin' birds flutter
In utter contentment
Ev'ry darn daisy
Feels lazy in bed
Even the skeeters an the fleas
Say "May I?", "Thanks", and "Please"
Why it's just as close to perfect
As you can get
Darlin', I swear
Once you been there
There ain't a view beneath the blue
That could ever compare
The only thing missin'
Is you as my guest
On that little patch of heaven
Way out west

Why don'tcha come visit
There's room in the nest
On that little patch of heaven
Way out westEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Talking to myself here
Is causing great concern for my health
Where is your head Kathryn
Where is your head
I'm trying hard to escape this
Constant pull towards ache
Why do you fight Kathryn
Why do you fight
Surely help will arrive soon
To cure these self induced wounds
Why hurt yourself Kathryn
Why hurt yourself
Why hurt yourself
Can your heart conceal
What the mind of love reveals
I'm talking to myself again
Is causing great concern for my health
Where is your head Kathryn

I live in the hills
You live in the valley
And all that you know
Are these blackbirds
You rise every morning
Wondering what in the world
Will the world bring today
Will it bring you joy
Or will it take it away?
And every step you take
Is guided by
The map of the light on the land
And the blackbird's cry
You will walk, you will walk
You will walk in good company
The valley is dark, the burgeoning holding
The stillness obscured by their judging
You walk through the shadows
Uncertain and surely hurting
Deserted by the blackbirds
And the staccato of the staff
And though you trust the light
Towards which you wend your way
Sometimes it feels all that you wanted
Has been taken away
You will walk, you will walk
You will walk in good company
I love the best in you
You love the best in me
Though it's not always easy
The lovely, the lonely
We will walk, we will walk
We will walk in good company
The shepherd, upright and flowing
You seeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I was alright for a while
I could smile for a while
Then I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
When you stopped to say hello
You wished me well, you couldn't tell
That I'd been crying over you
Crying over you
Then you said so long
And left me standing all alone
Alone and crying
Crying, crying, crying
It's hard to understand
That the touch of your hand
Can start me crying
I thought that I was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more than I did before
But darling what can I do?
No you don't love me and I'll always be
Crying over you
Crying over you
Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying
Crying, crying, over youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Are you breathing
What I'm breathing?
Are your wishes the same as mine
Are you needing
What I'm needing
I'm waiting for a sign

My hands tremble
My heart aches
Is it you calling
Is it you calling

If I'm alone in this
I don't think I can face
The consequences of falling (consequences of falling)
The consequences of falling (consequences of falling)

Are you thinking
What I'm thinking
Does your pulse quicken like mine
Are you dreaming
What I'm dreaming
I can't read your mind
One step towards you
Two steps back
Feels like I'm crawling
Feels like I'm crawling

If I'm alone in this
I don't think I can face
The consequences of falling (consequences of falling)
The consequences of falling (consequences of falling)
The consequences of falling

My hands tremble
My heart aches
Is it you calling
Is it you calling

If I'm alone in this
I don't think I can face

What is love
You called it heaven above
Star that shine in the night
A bird that sings in its flight
A flower that blooms in the spring
There's no such thing
Love's like a cigarette
You know you had my heart aglow
Between your fingertips
And just like a cigarette
I never knew the thrill of life
Until you touched my lips
Then just like a cigarette
Love seem to fade away and leave behind ashes of regret
And with a flick of your fingertips
It was easy for you to forget
Coz love is like a cigarette
Then just like a cigarette
Love seem to fade away and leave behind ashes of regret
And with a flick of your fingertips
It was easy for you to forget
Coz love is like a cigaretteEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She was a big boned gal
From southern Alberta
You just couldn't call her small
And you can bet every Saturday night
She'd be heading for the legion hall
Put her blue dress on
And she'd curl her hair
Oh she's been waiting all week
And with a bounce in her step
And a wiggle in her walk
She'd be swinging down the street
You could tell she was ready
By the look in her eye
As she slipped in through the crowd
She walked with grace
As she entered the place
Ya, the big boned gal was proud
Hey hey the big boned gal
Ain't no doubt hse's a natural
Shakin' and a'snakin'
And a'breakin' up across the floor
Hey hey the big boned gal
Ain't no doubt she's a natural
Reelin' and a'rockin'
And she's yelling out for more
Now people would come
From miles around
And gather there to dance
But when the big boned gal came shufflin' in
She'd hold them in a tranceEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Keen to the shifting of wind
I bend to it blind
To rid these kisses of sin
That must stay behind
Sour the fruit of neglect
The core of my doubt
Deprived are my veins you infect
With or without
Fate must have a reason
Why else endure the season
Of hollow soul
The ground on which we leave on
How strangely fuels the season
Of hollow soul hollow soul
Seed of uprooted chance
Are grains of goodbye
Waving boughs so slowly dance
Questioning why
Fate must have a reason
Why else endure the season
Of hollow soul
The ground on which we leave on
How strangely fuels the season
Of hollow soul
La la la la ...
Fate must have a reason
Why else endure the season
Of hollow soul hollow soul

Why else endure the season

A thin ice covers my soul
My body's frozen and my heart is cold
And still so much about me is raw
I search for a place to unthaw

Something in me broods love into fear
It veils my vision, leaves my thoughts unclear
And my eyes from blue turn to grey
Hoping to mask what they say

I've been outside myself for so long
Any feeling I had is close to gone
I've been outside myself for so long

I have been in a storm of the sun
Basking, senseless to what I've become
A fool to worship just light
When after all, it follows night

I've been outside myself for so long
Any feeling I had is close to gone
I've been outside myself for so long
So long
I've been outside myself for so long
Any feeling I had is close to gone
I've been outside myself for so longEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Trail of broken hearts
Looking back at you
Now and from the start
These words will travel true
The godspeed of trust
Will settle the dust
We've been passing through
Leaving just a part
Down the trail of broken hearts
Broken trail so long
A long and tired past
An emptiness has gone
I've found this place at last
And here will remain
With only the aim
Of staying sure and fast
Leaving just a part
Down the trail of broken heartsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
