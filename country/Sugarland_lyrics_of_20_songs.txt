What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made

I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said "No one else," how could you do this, babe?

You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you "babe"

What a waste
Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe

I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball
We said, "No one else", how could you do this, babe?
You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time

Since you admitted it (Oh), I keep picturin' (Oh)
Her lips on your neck (Oh), I can't unsee it (Oh)
I hate that because of you (Oh), I can't love you, babe
What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe?

You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
How could you do this, babe?
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe

How could you do this, babe?
I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
You said "No one else," we ain't gettin' through this one, babe
I break down every time you call, this is the last time
We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball
This is the last time
You said "No one else"
This is the last time I'll ever call you "babe"12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I've been sitting here staring at the clock on the wall
And I've been laying here praying, praying she won't call
It's just another call from home
And you'll get it and be gone
And I'll be crying
And I'll be begging you, baby
Beg you not to leave
But I'll be left here waiting
With my heart on my sleeve
Oh, for the next time we'll be here
Seems like a million years
And I think I'm dying
What do I have to do to make you see
She can't love you like me?

Why don't you stay?
I'm down on my knees
I'm so tired of being lonely
Don't I give you what you need?
When she calls you to go
There is one thing you should know
We don't have to live this way
Baby, why don't you stay?
You keep telling me, baby
There will come a time
When you will leave her arms
And forever be in mine
But I don't think that's the truth
And I don't like being used and I'm tired of waiting
It's too much pain to have to bear
To love a man you have to share

Why don't you stay?
I'm down on my knees
I'm so tired of being lonely
Don't I give you what you need?
When she calls you to go
There is one thing you should know
We don't have to live this way
Baby, why don't you stay?

I can't take it any longer
But my will is getting stronger
And I think I know just what I have to do
I can't waste another minute
After all that I've put in it
I've given you my best
Why does she get the best of you
So next time you find you wanna leave her bed for mine
Why don't you stay?
I'm up off my knees
I'm so tired of being lonely
You can't give me what I need
When she begs you not to go
There is one thing you should know
I don't have to live this way
Baby, why don't you stay, yeah?3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Where do we start?
How 'bout right here where we are?
You've been carryin' this weight around
Walk in the door and lay it down
Life goes fast
It's been a while, I have to ask
Where have you been? How did that feel?
Where are we now? 'Cause that's what's real, yeah

All the space and the time between us
Man, you should have seen us
This ain't no mystery
Our future is our history

I feel alive, and can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
And here we are (here we are), we've come so far
Let's leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
What comes next
We don't know, we're not there yet
But I bet it's gonna shine
Brighter than all we left behind

In a room in a blink and now it's
Like we never went a day without it
Pick it back up where we left off
This is liftoff (three... two... one)

I feel alive, and can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
And here we are (here we are), we've come so far
Let's leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same

Ooh-ooh, watch it spinnin'
And ooh-ooh, jump right in an'
And ooh-ooh, let's begin
And we can see, don't have to be
A big step, just imagine
Take a breath, let it happen
When I hear you laugh
It sets me free, it sets me free
I feel alive, and can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
And here we are (here we are), we've come so far
Let's leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same

I feel alive  (here we are), and can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She'll take you in, feed your friends
Her open arms are welcoming
She'll rub your back all night when you're crying
She'll listen to you tell your story
Hold your fear and all your worries
Help you find the truth when they're all lying
Even when it's hopeless, she keeps trying

She's your mother, you love her
There won't be another place like her again that you call home
She stands here to help you, there's nothing she won't do
As long as she's alive, you're not alone, you've got each other
That's your mother

She fixes all the broken things
When you're in love, she's got a ring
To give to you, she hopes you'll give away
She don't care who you give it to
Where they're from, if they pray like you
As long as they are good to you, that's enough
First thing she taught you was love is love

She's your mother, you love her
There won't be another place like her again that you call home
She stands here to help you, there's nothing she won't do
As long as she's alive, you're not alone, you've got each other
That's your mother
When you fail her, when you're afraid
And crying in the careless mess you've made
She'll make you clean it up yourself and offer you a little help
And dry your weary eyes when you let her
But she'll look at you and know you can do better

She's your mother, you love her
There won't be another place like her again that you call home
She stands here to help you, there's nothing she won't do
As long as she's alive, you're not alone, you've got each other
And the secrets in your heart she's always known

She's a beacon, a harbour
A lighthouse, her armour
A promise and a blanket when it's cold
You'll understand it more when you get older
You've got each other
That's your mother
You've got each other
That's your mother2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Mmm, better
Mmm, better

Absolutely no one that knows me better
No one that can make me feel so good
How did we stay so long together?
When everybody, everybody said we never would

And just when I, I start to think they're right
The love has died

There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time?
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in
And I know, oh
I'm never letting this go
I'm stuck on you
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me, baby, we're stuck like glue
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me, baby, we're stuck like glue
Some days I don't feel like trying
Some days you know I wanna just give up
When it doesn't matter who's right, fight about it all night
Had enough
You give me that look
"I'm sorry, baby, let's make up"

You do that thing that makes me laugh
And just like that

There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time? (Do it, do it)
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in
And I know, oh
I'm never letting this go, oh
I'm stuck on you
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me, baby, we're stuck like glue
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me, baby, we're stuck like glue
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
You almost fell out
Too stuck together from the ATL
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Feeling kinda sick?
Just a spoon full of sugar make it better real quick
I say: "Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
What you gonna do with that?
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Come on over here with that
Sugar sticky sweet stuff
Come on, give me that stuff
Everybody wants some
Melodies that get stuck"

The stars stay up all night
Don't know, can't see 'em
For the glow of the neon lights
And it's a long way from here
To the place where the home fires burn
Well, it's 2,000 miles and one left turn

Dear Mom and Dad

Well, I love you more than anything in the world

Big town full of little white lies

People walkin' around like the world's about to end
And if you’re asking me, my mind would agree
These days we all feel small, my friend
It’s getting harder and harder to hold our heads up high
Baby, let’s circle the wagons
Show all the dragons they don’t own the sky
We know how to fly

Gravity can’t hold us down
We're moving at the speed of sound
Past the point from here on out
There’s no going back

'Cause we were born for better days
We’ll find a way, yeah
We’re gonna be bigger
Don't give up, you’re more than enough
Believe me love, yeah
You’re gonna be bigger

Lookin' at everybody else
And you hate yourself
And it hurts your heart
Yeah, it’s easy to let it
Make you forget it
You are perfect the way you are
Gravity can’t hold you down
You’re moving at the speed of sound
Past the point from here on out
There’s no going back

'Cause we were born for better days
We’ll find a way, yeah
We’re gonna be bigger
Don't give up, you’re more than enough
Believe me love, yeah
You’re gonna be bigger

If they’re uninvited, don't shut your mouth, don't keep quiet
Just let 'em know that they can't try it
That this body's your temple and they can’t buy it
'Cause nobody’s money, no 'mount of power
No kind of bait can make you take
And hate yourself for what they did
You won’t forget, you can't forgive
They think they're big, but you’re bigger

'Cause we were born for better days
We’ll find a way, yeah
We’re gonna be bigger
Don't give up you’re more than enough
(Gonna be gonna be) believe me love, yeah
You're gonna be bigger
'Cause we were born for better days
We’ll find (gonna be, gonna be) a way, yeah
We’re gonna be bigger
Don't give up you’re more than enough
Believe me love, yeah
You’re gonna be bigger

Feels like I'm flying
Wings made of light
Brand new and shining
Like a shot rung out through the night

A heart that beats an incredible machine
Made of blood, and love, and hope, and lust, and steam

Calling
Calling
Calling

Feels like I'm floating
Weightless in flight
Light that's exploding
As a soul and gravity fight



Lifted higher mercury skies above
Calling
Water, fire burning a sight of love

Yesterday hell rained down
Another kid, another school, in another town
Think about how to tell my son
Think about how that one got a gun

There are mysteries down where the blood meets the bone
The loneliness there, wouldn't leave him alone
But what if we try to reach him with words
What if we looked in his eyes and asked "where does it hurt?"
Would he find all he was worth?
Monday was hoping
But Tuesday's broken

On the bed, feet up on the wall
Her eyes are red, and wet, and she wants to end it all
Easy to be mean on the screen, cowards call you names
She reads the lies and multiplies the hurt and shame
Man, it's a numbers game

There are mysteries down where the blood meets the bone
The loneliness there, it won't leave her alone
But what if we try to reach her with words
What if we looked in her eyes and asked "where does it hurt?"
Would she find all she was worth?
Monday was hoping
But Tuesday's broken
Like voices, won't make a sound
We keep missing chances to turn it around
If somebody's hurting right now
Open your mouth

What if we try to reach them with words
What if we looked in their eyes and asked "where does it hurt?"
Would they find all they were worth?
Monday was hoping
Don't leave it unspoken
But Tuesday's broken1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Chills on my skin, I wanna feel that again
Bodies can talk, no words at all, and we said everything
Yeah, I left tie the hands of the clock
We were just getting started babe, we couldn't stop
Reckless, breathless in case you forgot

Let me remind you
My touch can always find you
Follow this, my kiss will guide you
It's time to speak the way love understands
Like a language you'll never forget it
It can show us the way if we let it take us
So slow down, I know how
Let me remind you
Let me remind you

Let me remind you, when we first met
Do you remember? 'Cause I will never forget
The way you held my hand, the way you held the door
The way you held me the way no one's ever held me before
When I wake and your face shines above me
No morning breaking like waves when you love me
Pulling me in all over again
Let me remind you
My touch can always find you
Follow this, my kiss will guide you
It's time to speak the way love understands
Like a language you'll never forget
It can show us the way if we let it take us
So slow down, I know how
Let me remind you
My touch can always find you
Follow this, my kiss will guide you
It's time to speak the way love understands
Like a language you'll never forget it
It can show us the way if we let it take us
So slow down, I know how
Let me remind you
Let me remind you

Gods and poets weep their diamonds
We may look down to find us
Tangled and shining and timeless
I give 'em all to you
Like the stars when they dance and align to
Hearts beating and breathing in time to
Every curve, every curve
It's how they designed you
Let me remind you
My touch can always find you
Follow this, my kiss will guide you
It's time to speak the way love understands
Like a language you'll never forget it
It can show us the way if we let it take us

Got my hands in my pocket
Got a heart like a rocket
Man, a train couldn't stop it today
I got a smile like the sunshine
Eyes close, keeping time
My feet know the beat and the way

Can't hold this down
We own this town
Done walkin' 'round
From now on...

I'm on a roll, babe
Watch me go, babe
I'm solid gold, babe
Of good things getting better
Life is short, but so sweet
So cut the cake and let's eat
Right next to me is where you wanna be
I just can't stop
I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll
Got my headphones thumping
Feel my blood start to pumpin'
And ain't it something when the rhythm's insane
It's like the whole world's dancing
I hold it in my hand
Like a kid that is ready to play

My mirror ball
It shines and spins
Even if it falls, I still win

'Cause it can roll, babe
Watch me go, babe
I'm solid gold, babe
Of good things getting better
Life is short, but so sweet
So cut the cake and let's eat
Right next to me is where you wanna be
I just can't stop
I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll

I'm on a roll babe, I wanna reach out and touch your soul, babe
I'm like a southern Baptist preacher, babe
I got enough of that in me that I can reach you, babe
I'm picking up speed, hit the gas, go fast
'Cause there's nothing more fun to me
I just love it how lucky I am, kiss the dice
Ace of spades, remember the third grade
You on fire, gotta stop, drop...
And roll, babe
Watching me go, babe
I'm solid gold babe
Of good things getting better
Life is short, but so sweet
So cut the cake and let's eat

Lay where you're laying, don't make a sound

All the commotion, the kiddie like play
Got people talking, talking

Down in the alley, the breaking of day
The head while I'm driving, I'm driving
Soft lips are open, knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dying, you're dying
And you, your sex is on fire
Consumed with what will transpire
Hot as a fever, rattling bones
I could just taste it, taste it
If it's not forever, if it's just tonight
Oh, it's still the greatest, the greatest, the greatest

Come on

Monday, hard to wake up
Fill my coffee cup, I'm out the door
Yeah, the freeway's standing still today
It's gonna make me late, and that's for sure

I'm running out of gas and out of time
Never gonna make it there by nine

There's gotta be something more
Gotta be more than this
I need a little less hard time
I need a little more bliss
I'm gonna take my chances
Taking a chance, I might
Find what I'm looking for
There's gotta be something more

Five years and there's no doubt
That I'm burnt out, I've had enough
So now boss man, here's my two weeks
I'll make it short and sweet, so listen up
I could work my life away, but why? (Why?)
I got things to do before I die

There's gotta be something more
Gotta be more than this
I need a little less hard time
I need a little more bliss
I'm gonna take my chances
Taking a chance, I might
Find what I'm looking for
There's gotta be something more

Some believe in destiny, and some believe in fate
I believe that happiness is something we create
You best believe that I'm not gonna wait
Because there's gotta be something more

I get home, 7:30, the house is dirty, but it can wait
Yeah, 'cause right now, I need some downtime
To drink some red wine and celebrate
Yeah, Armageddon could be knocking at my door
But I ain't gonna answer, that's for sure
There's gotta be something
Gotta be something more
Gotta be more than this
I need a little less hard time
I need a little more bliss

Missed my alarm clock ringing
Woke up, telephone screaming
Boss man singing his same old song
Rolled in late about an hour
No cup of coffee, no shower
Walk of shame with two different shoes on
Now it's poor me, why me, oh me, boring
The same old worn out blah blah story
There's no good explanation for it at all

Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over think it
Let go laughing
Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is
Pshh it happens

My trusty-rusty had a flat
I borrowed my neighbors cadillac
"I'll be right back," going down to wally world
That yellowed light turned red too quickly
Knew that truck the moment it hit me
Out stepped my ex and his new girl
"Sorry 'bout your neck baby"
But it's poor me, why me, oh me, boring
The same old worn out blah blah story
There's no good explanation for it at all
Ain't no rhyme or reason

These are the days of the underdog
The counted outs
The ones you don't see coming
Times of the left-behinds
The underneaths
The heart that's tired but still keeps running
Yeah man it's been a year
Sometimes I wish I could disappear
Had a door slammed and my heart broken
But somehow the window's still open
Silent voices I've never heard
All waiting to say the words
Held up and kept inside
But we don't have to hide
Tell me I am not the only
One here feeling lonely
Tell me I don't have to try so hard
Tell me I'm alright and then say
It's all gonna be okay
Tell me you'll be careful with my heart
These are the days of the hard fight
The dark night
And the light I use against it
And they tell me no
Still go for broke
And keep swinging for the fences
Kids keep getting a little bit older
And the news outside keeps getting colder
So heavy I can't put it down
So I keep on carrying it around
Hold on to the  within
I learned to smile and pretend
Outside nobody knows
There's a fire deep down below
Tell me I am not the only
One here feeling lonely
Tell me I don't have to try so hard
Tell me I'm alright and then say
It's all gonna be okay
Tell me you'll be careful with my heart
Tell me I am not the only
One here feeling lonely
Tell me I don't have to try so hard
Tell me I'm alright and then say
It's all gonna be okay
Tell me you'll be careful with my heart
We are the underdogs
The counted outs
The ones you don't see coming
The left-behinds
The underneaths
The hearts that beat
We wanna wake up in the world
We know we fell asleep in
We wanna live and give it all
To a love we can believe in
And there's gotta be more like me
Hey, there's gotta be more like me

My mama mapped out the road that she knows
Which hands you shake and which hands you hold
In my hand-me-down mercury, ready to roll
She knew that i had to go
And hang out, make lots of noise
And lay out late with a boy
Make the mistakes that she made 'cause she knew all along

I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
Life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump on

They say the first time won't ever last
But that didn't stop me. The first time he laughed
All my friends tried to warn me the day that we met
"Girl, don't you lose your heart yet"
But his dark eyes dared me with danger
And sparks fly like flame to a paper
Fire in his touch burning me up, but still i held on

I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
Life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump on
The last time i saw him, we packed up my things
And he smiled like the first time he told me his name
And we cried with each other
We split the blame for the parts that we couldn't change
Pictures, dishes and socks
It's our whole life down to one box
There he was waving goodbye on the front porch alone

But i was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
Hang out, make lots of noise
And lay out late with a boy
Make the mistakes that she made, life is a runaway train
His dark eyes dared me with danger
And sparks fly like flame to a paper, fire in his touch
Life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump onEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In the closet right there in the back
If you want it, I'll go get my bag
And I'll say it's the end of us
And you'll ask me if I love you
Well, I must

I'll turn and walk right out the door
Like I've done a thousand times before
Why don't you show me I'm worth more?
More than this one reason
Till you love me like I'm leaving

Yeah, you watch me get into the car
Well, you always let me get that far
And you'll stand with both hands on the hood
You' think that I won't turn the key
But I could

I'll turn and run back in the door
Like I've done a thousand times before
Why don't you show me I'm worth more?
More than just one reason
So many more, but you don't see them
Till you love me like I'm leaving
Haven't made up my mind
Won't look back this time
I won't turn around again
So good at goodbyes
Don't look so surprised
This is where it's gotta end
So kiss me hard and let me go
Same old story, different ending though

I'll turn and walk right out the door
Like I've done a thousand times before
I'm gonna show you I'm worth more
So say your lines like you believe them
Baby one more time with feeling
You can love me like I'm leaving

Oh, I got me
Oh, I got me
Love me like I'm leaving
I'm leaving
You can love me like I'm leaving
I'm leaving
You can love me like I'm leaving
I'm gonna show you I'm worth more
I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna show you I'm worth...
(Love me like I'm leaving) More
I'm worth more
I'm worth moreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I don't want to get up, baby lets turn off the phone
I don't want to go to work today or even put my make-up on
I got better things to do than my to-do list anyway
Hide under the covers and waste away the day
Let's just lay here and be lazy, baby, drive me crazy

All I want to do
All I want to do..... is love you

I got my whole life to change the world and climb the ladders
Looking at you looking at me is the only thing that matters
Come a little closer baby, we can talk without words
Hang a sign on the door, "Please do not disturb"
Let's just lay here and be lazy, baby, drive me crazy

All I want to do
All I want to do..... is love you

Give me a kiss, from that Elvis lip
You don't want to miss this
All I want to do.....
All I want to do..... is love you

All I really want to do is
All I really want to do is
All I really want to do is love you and love you and love you
Come a little closer baby we can talk without words
Hang a sign on the door
"Please do not, please do not, please do not, please do not disturb"

When I lay down in the evening
All I really want to do is
When I wake up when I wake up in the morning baby
All I really want to do is
Ooo......
Ooo......1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's safe and quiet, all you've ever known
You didn't choose it, but you call it home
You wouldn't have these wings
If you weren't meant to fly
It's where you learn to sing
I'll meet you on the outside

A bird in a cage
Don't know that you were born to fly away
The world's a bigger place
Than all the fear you face
It's hard to explain
To a bird in a cage

You dreamed you heard a song
Outside the open door
They told you it was wrong
So you don't dream no more
They tell you to believe
What they believe is right
Will you choose fight or flight?

For a bird in a cage
Don't know that you were born to fly away
The world's a bigger place
Than all the fear you face
It's hard to explain
To a bird in a cage
Same hands that hold your prayer
Same hands that keep you there
You try to shift the blame
When there's nowhere to put the pain but
Who you are is back behind it
And I believe that you can find it
When the dark feels like it's darker
You've tried easy and I've tried harder to chase

You're not a bird in a cage
You were born to fly away
The world's a bigger place
Than all the fear you face
And you were never made
Are we all birds in a cage? (birds in a cage)
Are we all born this way? (are we born this way?)
We try not to think about it
What we would be without it
You were never made (you were never made)
To be a bird in a cage (to be a bird in a cage)
You were born to fly away
The world's a bigger place
Than all the fear you face
And you were never made
To be a bird in a cageEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When you walk into the edge of those dark and lonely woods
And when I ask "How was your day?"
You answer "Not so good"
And when nothing seems to be working out quite the way it should
I will shine the light
When the skies up above you fill with gray and stormy clouds
And there's not a single face you know in the maddening crowd
When you know that you will make your way, but you just can't see how

I will shine the light
I will shine the light
I will shine the light

I will hold you in my arms until everything's alright
I will shine the light
And when your worries, they won't let you sleep and rob you of your days
And you've looked in all directions but you still can't find your way
Or when you just need someone to remind you that it's all gonna be okay


When you're staring down your demons waiting in your darkest night
I will shine the light
Sometimes we jump into the great unknown
Some roads we're on, we'll have to walk alone
But waiting there in the end is a heart that calls you a friend
That's me
Clapping the loudest, welcoming you home
So when your heart is heavy like a stone
From carrying it's load
And you look into the mirror and see someone you don't know
Or when the shadows are closing in on you like a hand around your throat

When you've given into your fear
When you've lost your will to fight
Let me know that I can do
Let me try to make it right
And I will shine the light
I will shine the lightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
