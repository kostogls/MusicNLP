I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of '25
But I am still alive

I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner around the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder
Across a river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder, on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that gray tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around
And around, and around, and around
And around, and around, and around...
I fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again
And again, and again, and again
And again, and again...18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I am a shotgun rider
For the San Jacinto line
The desert is my brother
My skin is cracked and dry
I was riding on a folk coach
And everything was fine
Till we took a shorter road
To save some time
The bandits only fired once
They shot me in the chest
They may have wounded me but
They'll never get the best
Of better men
Cause I'll ride again

I am a river gambler
I make a living dealing cards
My clothes are smooth and honest
My heart is cold and hard
I was shuffling for some delta boys
On a boat for New Orleans
I was the greatest shark they'd ever seen
But the captain bumped a sandbar
And an ace fell from my sleeve
They threw me overboard
As I swore I didn't cheat
But I could swim
And I'll ride again
We are heroes of the homeland, American remains
We live in many faces and answer many names
We will not be forgotten, we won't be left behind
Our memories live on in mortal minds
And poets pens
We'll ride again
I am a mid-west farmer
I make a living off the land
I ride a John Deere tractor
I'm a liberated man
But the rain it hasn't fallen
Since the middle of July
And if it don't come soon my crops will die
The bank man says he likes me
But there's nothing he can do
He tells me that he's coming
But the clouds are coming too
He ain't my friend
And I'll ride again

I am an American Indian
My tribe is Cherokee
My forefathers loved this land
They left it here for me
But the white man came with boats
And trains and dirty factories
An' poisoned my existence with his deeds
Nature is our mother
We are sucklings at her breast
And he who tries to beat her down
Will lose her to the rest
They'll never win
I'll ride again

I'm gonna steal me a silver stallion
With not a mark upon his silky hide
Teach him he can trust me like a brother
One day we'll saddle up and ride

And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like the one eyed jack of diamonds
With the devil close behind
We're gonna ride

I'm gonna find me a reckless woman
Razor blades and dice in her eyes
Just a touch of sadness in her fingers
Thunder and lightening in her thighs

And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like the one eyed jack of diamonds
With the devil close behind
We're gonna ride

I'm gonna chase the sky forever
With the woman and the stallion and the wind
And the sun is gonna burn into a cinder
Before we ever pass this way again
And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like the one eyed jack of diamonds
With the devil close behind
We're gonna ride1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I played the Red River Valley
And he'd sit out in the kitchen and cry
An' run his fingers through 70 years of living
An' wonder Lord, as ever, will that drill run dry?
We were friends, me an this old man

Like desperados waiting for a train
Like desperados waiting for a train

He's a drifter, and a driller of oil wells
And an old-school man of the world
He'd let me drive his car when he's too drunk to
And he'd wink, and give me money for the girls
And our lives were like some old western movie

Like desperados waiting for a train
Like desperados waiting for a train

From the time that I could walk, he'd take me with him
To a bar, called the Green Frog Cafe
And there were old men, with beer-guts and dominoes
Lying about their lives while they play
And I was just a kid, they called his sidekick
Like desperados waiting for a train
Like desperados waiting for a train

One day I looked up, and he's pushing 80
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why is he all dressed up like them old men?
Drinking beer and playing Moon in 42

Like desperados waiting for a train
Like desperados waiting for a train

The day before he died, I went to see him
I was grown, and he was almost gone

So we just closed our eyes and dreamed of supper kitchens
And sang another verse to that old song
Come on Jack, that son-of-a-gun's a-coming

Like desperados waiting for a train
Like desperados waiting for a train
Like desperados waiting for a train
Like desperados waiting for a trainEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The wind blows hard across the Texas plains
Makes some people go insane
While others quietly pray for rain
That's where we came from
Two boys playing in the burning sun
One with books, one with guns
Mama calls but just one comes
The other one runs

In a crystal sense of wrong and right
We were born and raised in black and white
One learned to pray, one loved to fight
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

Brother took to the gospel road
Spent his whole live saving souls
When he looked at me his blood ran cold
He didn't even try

I had no dreams, I had no plans
But a gun felt good in my right hand
The warden asked how come you killed that man
I said I don't know why
Welcome home said the hot moonlight
We were born and raised in black and white
One lives to pray, one prays for life
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

Someone handed me a cigarette
They offered me my last request
I asked my mortal soul be blessed
By someone close to me
He came to me with trembling hands
He swore he'd never understand
I said it's just what life had planned
It's destiny

Don't waste your tears on me tonight
We were born and raised in black and white
I chose the dark, you chased the light
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

The wind blows hard across the Texas plains
Makes some people go insane
While others quietly pray for rainEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Sherry was a waitress
At the only joint in town
She had a reputation
As a girl who'd been around
Down Main Street after midnight
With a brand new pack of cigs
A fresh one hanging from her lips
A beer between her legs
She'd ride down to the river
And meet with all her friends
 
The road goes on forever
And the party never ends
 
Sonny was a loner
Bolder than the rest
He was going in the Navy
But he couldn't pass the test
So he hung around town
And he sold a little pot
The law got wind of Sonny
And one day he got caught
But he was back in business
When they set him free again
 
The road goes on forever
And the party never ends
 
Sonny's playing eight ball
At the joint where Sherry works
Some drunken out-of-towner
Put his hand up Sherry's skirt
Sonny took his pool cue
Laid the drunk out on the floor
Stuffed a dollar in her tip jar
Walked out of the door
She's running right behind him
Reaching for his hand
 
The road goes on forever
And the party never ends
 
They jumped into his pick-up
Sonny jammed her down in gear
Sonny looked at Sherry
Said, "Let's get on out of here."
The stars were high above them
The moon was in the east
The sun was setting on them
When they reached Miami Beach
They got a motel by the water
And a quart of Bombay Gin
 
The road goes on forever
And the party never ends
 
They soon ran out of money
But Sonny knew a man
Who knew some Cuban refugees
Who dealt in contraband
Sonny met the Cuban
In a house just off the route
With a briefcase full of money
And a pistol in his boot
The cards were on the table
When the law came bustin' in
 
The road goes on forever
And the party never ends
 
The Cubans grabbed the goodies
Sonny grabbed the jack
He broke the bathroom window
And climbed on out the back
Sherry drove the pick-up
Through the alley on the side
Where the lawman tackled Sonny
And was reading him his rights
She stepped out in the alley
With a single-shot four-ten
 
The road goes on forever
And the party never ends
 
They left the lawman dying
And they made their get away
Got back to the motel
Just before the break of day
Sonny gave her all the money
And he blew a little kiss
If they ask you how this happened
Say I forced you into this
She watched him as his tail lights
Disappeared around the bend
 
The road goes on forever
And the party never ends
 
There's a main street after midnight
Just like it was before
Twenty-one months later
At the local grocery store
Sherry buys a paper
And a cold six-pack of beer
The headlines read that Sonny
Is going to the chair
She pulls back onto main street
In her new Mercedes-Benz
 
The road goes on forever
And the party never endsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

This is the last cowboy song
The end of a hundred year waltz
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along
Another piece of America's lost

He rides the feed lots, clerks in the markets
On weekends sellin' tobacco and beer
And his dream's of tomorrow, surrounded by fences
But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here
He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark
And eyeball to eyeball, old Wyatt backed down
He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas
And rode with the Seventh when Custer went down

This is the last cowboy song
The end of a hundred year waltz
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along
Another piece of America's lost

Remmington showed us how he looked on canvas
And Louis Lamour has told us his tale
Me and Johnny and Waylon and Kris sing about him
And wish to God we could have ridden his trail
The old Chisholm trail is covered in concrete now
They truck it to market in fifty foot rigs
They roll by his markings and don't even notice
Like living and dying was all he ever did

This is the last cowboy song
The end of a hundred year waltz
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along
Another piece of America's lost
This is the last cowboy song
The end of a hundred year waltz...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna cross that river
I'm gonna catch tomorrow now
You're going to want to hold me
Just like I always told you
You're going to miss me when I'm gone

Nobody here will ever find me
But I will always be around
Just like the songs I leave behind me
I'm gonna live forever now

You fathers and you mothers
Be good to one another
Please try to raise your children right
Don't let the darkness take them
Don't make them feel forsaken
Just lead them safely to the light

Nobody here will ever find me
But I will always be around
Just like the songs I leave behind me
I'm gonna live forever now
I'm gonna live forever

It seems like yesterday
But it was long ago
She was lovely, she was the queen of our nights
There in the darkness, with the radio playing low
The secrets that we shared
The mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire and out of control
There was nothin' left to burn and nothin' left to prove

And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it would never end
I remember how she held me oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

Against the wind
We were runnin' against the wind
We were young and strong
But just runnin' against the wind

The years rolled slowly past
I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home
I guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was livin' to run and runnin' to live
Never worryin' about payin' or how much I owed
Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breakin' all the rules I could bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again

Against the wind
We were runnin' against the wind
I found myself seekin' shelter against the wind

All those drifter's days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about

Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

Against the wind
We were runnin' against the wind
We found ourselves seekin' shelter against the wind
Against the wind
Against the windEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Was it bitter then
With our backs against the wall?

Were we better men
Than we'd ever been before?

Say, if she came again today
Would you still answer to the call?

Tell the truth my friend
Don't it matter anymore?

We were simple men
By her side when she was born

Talkin' about the dream

It was simple then
Like the freedom when you fall
And we were smaller then you see
But soon we gathered like a storm
They don't understand
What that thunder meant at all

Was he crucified
Was he done in by the law?

Are you satisfied
That he'll never ride again?

Some people say he got away
They say he never died at all

If that story's true
Does it bother you my friend?

Was it bitter then
With our backs against the wall?
Spoken
Say, two thousand years ago

Were we better men
Than we'd ever been before?
Spoken
Or two hundred years ago
Say, if she came again today
Would you still answer to the call?
Or tomorrow

Tell the truth my friend

I taught the weepin' willow how to cry, cry, cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, southern drawl
Then I heard my dream went back downstream cavortin' in Davenport
And I followed you, big river, when she called

Oh, she took me to St. Louis later on, down the river
A freighter said, "She's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone"
And I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block
Raised a few eyebrows and went on down alone
Well, I pulled into Natchez, next day down the river
But there wasn't much there to make the rounders stay very long
When I left, it was rainin', so nobody saw me cry
Big river, why she doin' me this way?

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf
She loves you, big river, more than me
I taught the weepin' willow how to cry, cry, cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river

She stepped down from her carriage
At Ten Vermillon Street
I took off my roustabout
And slung it at her feet
We went into her parlor
And she cooled me with her fan
But said, "I'll go no further
With a fantasy-makin' man"
I said, "I'd walk on the Poncha train
For what you have today"
Just a drink from your deep well
And I'll be on my way
She laughed and heaven filled the room
Said, "This I give to you
This body's wisdom is the flesh
But here's a thing or two"

Death and hell are never full
And neither are the eyes of men
Cats can fly from nine stories high
And pigs can see the wind
She let me make my pallet
In the moonlight on the floor
Just outside of paradise
But right in hell's back door
The image of her nibbled
At the eye of my soul
My dreams were a hurricane
And quite out of control
Then her voice came through the storm
It's more than flesh I deal
And you will have to pay
For any wisdom that you steal
I woke to tinted windows
In lavender and red
The first station of the cross
Is just above my head
I awoke to gargoyles
And a hard bench for my bed
Jesus Christ and Pontius Pilate
Were just above my head
Death and hell are never full
And neither are the eyes of men
Cats can fly from nine stories high
And pigs can see the windEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, now boys, I've been to Bethlehem
Rode there on a big steam train
Lost two fingers in the steel mills
And I ain't goin' back again

I fought for my country
Lord knows, I did my best
Crawlin' 'cross some foreign field
They pinned a ribbon to my chest

So, pass around the bottle, boys, let's talk about old times
Night rollin' in, it's cold as sin, here on the welfare line

Served on the Georgia Road Gang
Couldn't pay the debts I owe
'Cause I'm not made of silver
And I ain't never seen no gold

I still remember Rachael
Soft as a velvet gown
They laid her in the pauper's grave
On the other side of town
So, pass around the bottle, boys, let's talk about old times
Night rollin' in, it's cold as sin, here on the welfare line

I know some folks are born of money
You know I wish them well
If the devil would ever want my soul
I swear I'd never sell

So, pass around the bottle, boys, let's talk about old times
Night rollin' in, it's cold as sin, here on the welfare line

I've been obnoxious, I've been unconscious
I've been all kind of things that are hard to spell
I've been unruly, speaking truly
I've been so cool I couldn't hardly even stand myself
I've been a monster, without a sponsor
I've been Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
I've been a goner, I've been a loner
And when my mixture was right
I’m a nice bunch of guys
	
I am what I am cause I ain't what I used to be
Cause it is what it is but it ain't what it used to be
	
I've been a mover, I was a shaker
He had a girlfriend, I tried to snake her
I been mysterious, I been delirious
I been so weird it would killed a normal man
I wanted money, I wanted power
I want a monument kinda like the Eiffel Tower
I been lost at sea, I been lost in space
And when I fall in love I fall all over the place
	
	
Well, tell 'em about it
	
And you can go on forever and make the same mistakes
Or you can stand up on your hind legs and change your fate
Go on and do it till you finally see
What it is that it was that you don't want to be
I was an outlaw, I was an in-law
I was a scapegoat, that was the last straw
I hit the highway, singing my way
But it wound up sounding like 'you’ll never walk alone'
I got a story, reflected glory
Is the way that I been seeing for most of my life
I heard the laughter, up in the rafters
But I never ever thought that the joke was on me

Hey Babe, do you remember
Back in nineteen sixty-nine?
We gathered round the room
You sang yours and I sang mine
We took turns with the guitar
In the front and center seat
Shel and Kris and Dylan
And a couple off the street
Joni Mitchell cried on "Both Sides Now"
We sang songs that made a difference
And we can again somehow
Everybody knew that this was quite a special night
Graham Nash was nervous in the hot seat, in the light
Joe South was total magic and we all walked in his shoes
Orbison and Rabbitt cried and they rocked the country blues
Mickey Newbury's "San Francisco Mabel Joy"
We sang songs that made a difference
June was pregnant with my boy
Oh, I could make a living
Driving nails or driving trucks
Sleep beneath the bridge
Or in the streets, down on my luck
I'd stand the cold and hunger
If they'd let me hear the songs
Everybody write one
That us bums can sing along

Keep it from the heart and down to earth
Sing the songs that make a difference
Give us all our money's worth

Hey, keep it from the heart and down to earth
Sing the songs that make a difference
Give us all our money's worthEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There's a young man in town
Slip-sliding around
He likes to roll free and easy
There's only his way
He calls all the plays
And he lives on his island alone
But the sea is for sure
To test all the moors
Dropping off treasures from places unknown
Worth more than gold
To only be sold
By this young man of stone

And we're all in your corner tonight as friends
Watching you stumble the path where we've been
Hope your eyes open and you see the light
We're all in your corner tonight

The life boat we had was fragile and frail
By the time we set sail life's half over
Water's the view, drown out the truth
He's got to have proof that he's grown
There is no map to chart
A voyage of the heart
The love is a journey you make on your own
And if you don't take the chance
The angels won't dance
With an old man of stone

And we're all in your corner tonight as friends
Watching you stumble the path where we've been
Hope your eyes open and you see the light
We're all in your corner tonightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You'd've thought a king had died
The way those people cried
Instead of one more broken entertainer
Kristofferson:
It struck those in his trade
He could-a had it made
If he'd only been a little saner
Jennings:
They traveled far to see him
Oh, the humble and the high
They said goodbye as if he were a friend
All:
Now somewhere he is smilin'
On those who idolize him
But would they not recognize him
If he came back again?
Nelson:
He was born of modest means
And had outrageous dreams
They never let him rest till he fullfilled them
Cash:
While he rode that train of song
His devils tagged along
The whiskey and the pills just couldn't kill him
Nelson:
He didn't mean to be a rebel
Cash:
No the real ones never do
Nelson:
They are born apart from ordinary men
All:
And somewhere he is smilin'
On those who sanctify him
But would they not recognize him

But it's a damn shame nonetheless

About the time my daddy left to fight the big war
I saw my first pistol in the general store
The general store, when I was thirteen
Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen
I asked if I could have one some day when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt
Shoots like lighting but it loads a-might slow
Loads a-might slow and soon I found out
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out

So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45
Called a "peacemaker," but I never knew why
I never knew why, I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand


I got into a card game in a Cumberland town
Caught a miner cheating and I shot the dog down

Shot the dog down, watched the man fall
Never touched his holster never had a chance to draw

The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, "Not guilty" I said
"Not guilty" I said, "you've got the wrong man"
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right handEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The crops are all in, and the peaches are rotten
The oranges are all packed in the creosote dumps
They're flying them back to the Mexican Border
To save all their money, and wade back again

My father's own father, he waded that river
Others before him have done just the same
They died in the hills, and they've died in the valley
Some went to heaven, without any name
