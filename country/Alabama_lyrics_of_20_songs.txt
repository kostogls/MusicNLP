Rollin' down a backwoods, Tennessee by-way
One arm on the wheel
Holding my lover with the other
A sweet, soft, southern thrill
Worked hard all week; got a little jingle
On a Tennessee Saturday night
Couldn't feel better, I'm together
With my dixieland delight

Spend my dollar, parked in a holler
'Neath the mountain moonlight
Hold her up tight
Make a little lovin'
A little turtle dovin'
On a Mason-Dixon night
Fits my life, oh so right
My Dixieland Delight

1:27 - 1:49

White-tail buck deer, munching on clover
Red-tail hawk sitting on a limb
A chubby old groundhog, croaking bullfrog
Free as the feeling in the wind
Home grown country girl, gonna give me a whirl
On a Tennessee Saturday night
Lucky as a seven, livin' in heaven
With my dixieland delight
Spend my dollar, parked in a holler
'Neath the mountain moonlight
Hold her up tight
Make a little lovin'
A little turtle dovin'
On a Mason-Dixon night
Fits my life, oh so right
My dixieland delight

3:11 - 3:43

Spend my dollar, parked in a holler
'Neath the mountain moonlight
Hold her up tight
Make a little lovin'
A little turtle dovin'
On a Mason-Dixon night
Fits my life, oh so right
My dixieland delight

4:09 - 4:41
Rolling down a backwoods Tennessee by-way
One arm on the wheel
Holding my lover with the other
She's a sweet soft southern thrill
Worked hard all week; got a little jingle
On a Tennessee Saturday night
Couldn't feel better, I'm together
With my dixieland delight4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song, Song of the south
Sweet potato pie and I shut my mouth
Gone, gone with the wind
There ain't no body looking back again
Cotton on roadside, cotton on the ditch
We all picked the cotton but we never got rich
Daddy was a veteran, a Southern Democrat
They oughta get rich man to vote like that
Singing:
Song song of the south
Sweet potato pie, and I shut my mouth
Gone gone with the wind
There ain't no body looking back again
Well somebody told us Wall Street fell
But we were so poor that we couldn't tell
The cotton was short, and the weeds was tall
But Mr. Roosevelt's a' gonna save us all
Well momma got sick, and daddy got down
The county got the farm, and we moved to town
Poppa got a job with the TVA
We bought a washing machine, and then a Chevrolet
Singing: Song song of the south
Sweet potato pie and I shut my mouth
Gone, gone with the wind
There ain't nobody looking back againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You see that mountain over there? Yeah?
Well, one of these days I'm going to climb that mountain

Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

Drift away like Tom Sawyer, ride a raft with old Huck Finn
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle, daze dreaming again

Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

Swim across the river, just to prove that I'm a man
Spend the day being lazy, just being nature's friend
Climb a long tall hickory. Bend it over, skinning cats
Playing baseball with chert rocks, using sawmill slabs for bats
Play some back-home, come-on music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feeling
Because that's where music has to start

Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

Oh play me mountain music
Oh play me mountain music
Oh play me mountain music
Oh play me mountain musicEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band
That lead guitar is hot but not for a Louisiana man
So rosin up that bow for "Faded Love" and let's all dance
If you're gonna play in Texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band

I remember down in Houston we were puttin' on a show
When a cowboy in the back stood up and yelled "Cotton Eye Joe!"
He said, "We love what you're doing, boys don't get us wrong
There's just something missing in your song"

If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band
That lead guitar is hot but not for a Louisiana man
So rosin up that bow for "Faded Love" and let's all dance
If you're gonna play in Texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band

So we dusted off our boots and put our cowboy hats on straight
Them Texans raised the roof when Jeff opened up his case
You say y'all all want to two-step, say you wanna do-si-do
Well here's a fiddling song before we go

If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band
That lead guitar is hot but not for a Louisiana man
So rosin up that bow for "Faded Love" and let's all dance
If you're gonna play in Texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band

If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band
That lead guitar is hot but not for a Louisiana man
So rosin up that bow for "Faded Love" and let's all dance
If you're gonna play in Texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band

Yee-haw!
*tongue roll*
Oh yeah!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There are people in this country
Who work hard every day
But not for fame or fortune do they strive
But the fruits of their labor
Are worth more than their pay
And it's time a few of them were recognized

Hello Detroit auto workers
Let me thank you for your time
You work a 40 hour week for a livin'
Just to send it on down the line
Hello Pittsburgh steel mill worker
Let me thank you for your time
You work a 40 hour week for a livin'
Just to send it on down the line

This is for the one who swings the hammer
Driving home the nail
Or the one behind the counter
Ringing up the sale
Or the one who fights the fires
The one who brings the mail
For everyone who works behind the scenes
You can see them every morning
In the factories and the fields
In the city streets and the quiet country towns
Working together like spokes inside a wheel
They keep this country turning around

Hello Kansas wheat field farmer
Let me thank you for your time
You work a 40 hour week for a livin'
Just to send it on down the line
Hello West Virginia coal miner
Let me thank you for your time
You work a 40 hour week for a livin'
Just to send it on down the line

This is for the one who drives the big rig
Up and down the road
Or the one out in the warehouse
Bringing in the load
Or the waitress, the mechanic
The policeman on patrol
For everyone who works behind the scenes
With a spirit you can't replace with no machine
Hello America, let me thank you for your timeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh, I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why

Don't know why
I have to drive so fast
My car has nothing to prove
It's not new
But it'll do 0 to 60 in 5.2, oh

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why

Can't be late
I leave in plenty of time
Shaking hands with the clock
I can't stop
I'm on a roll and I'm ready to rock, oh
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why

I hear a voice
It says I'm running behind
I better pick up my pace
It's a race
And there ain't no room
For someone in second place

I'm in a hurry to get things done
I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
I'm in a hurry to get things done
I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
I'm in a hurry to get things done
I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
I'm in a hurry to get things done
I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know whyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I was walking home from school on a cold winter day
Took a shortcut through the woods and I lost my way
It was getting late and I was scared and alone
But then a kind old man took my hand, and led me home
Now mama couldn't see him oh but he was standing there
And I knew in my heart he was the answer to my prayers

Oh I believe there are angels among us
Sent down to us from somewhere up above
They come to you and me in our darkest hours
To show us how to live to teach us how to give
To guide us with the light of love

When life held troubled times and had me down on my knees
There's always been someone to come along and comfort me
A kind word from a stranger to lend a helping hand
A phone call from a friend just to say I understand
But ain't it kind of funny at the dark end of the road
That someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope

Oh I believe there are angels among us
Sent down to us from somewhere up above
They come to you and me in our darkest hours
To show us how to live to teach us how to give
To guide us with the light of love
They wear so many faces show up in the strangest places
To grace us with their mercy in our time of need

Oh I believe there are angels among us
Sent down to us from somewhere up above
They come to you and me in our darkest hours
To show us how to live to teach us how to give
To guide us with the light of love
To guide us with the light of love3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If I had you we'd run like gypsies in the wind
We'd be lovers, we'd be friends
Oh, if I had you
If I had you, we'd count the stars all one by one
We'd make love 'til they were gone
Oh, if I had you
'Cause you light a fire way down in my soul
The flame keeps growin stronger there ain't no control
And there's nothing, no there's nothing, no there's nothing that I wouldn't do
If I had you
If I had you, we'd sail the seven seas as one
We'd never say "It can't be done"
No, if I had you
'Cause you light a fire way down in my soul
The flame keeps growing stronger 'cause there ain't no control
And theres nothing, no there's nothing, I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
If I had you...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Fly away with me tonight
Take me on a one-way flight in your loving arms
And everything's going to be alright
You're the one who took my hand
When no one else could understand
You're the one who moves me
Like nobody else can

Take me down where I want to be
Turn around, this man who lives inside of me
Take me down and love me all night long
Hold me close and make me strong
Take me down, take me down tonight

In your eyes I see a light
It's your emotions glowing bright
So keep the fires burning
And let it warm me through the night
You can be a part of me
'Cause you're what love was meant to be
You and me, baby
We'll set this flame inside free

You don't have to stay forever
Let's just put our hearts together
Share another night in ecstasy
We know that it's feeling better
Every time we get together
Maybe love was meant for you and me

Why should I feel discouraged?
And why should the shadows come?
And why should my heart be lonely
And long for heaven and home?
When Jesus is my portion
My constant friend is He
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
And I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I am free
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
Let not your heart be troubled
His tender word I hear
And resting on His goodness
I lose my doubts and fears
Though by the path He leads us
But one step I may see
His eye is on the sparrows
And I know He watches me
And I sing because I'm happy
And I sing because I'm free
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

By now in New York City, there's snow on the ground
And out in California, the sunshine's falling down
And maybe down in Memphis, Graceland's all in lights
And in Atlanta, Georgia, there's peace on earth tonight

Christmas in Dixie, it's snowing in the pines
Merry Christmas from Dixie to everyone tonight

It's windy in Chicago, the kids are out of school
There's magic in Motown, the city's on the move
In Jackson, Mississippi to Charlotte, Caroline
And all across the nation, it's a peaceful Christmas time

Christmas in Dixie, it's snowing in the pines
Merry Christmas from Dixie to everyone tonight

And from Fort Payne, Alabama
God bless you all, we love ya

Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy till you get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler, roll on. (roll on.)

Well, it's Monday morning, he's kissing momma goodbye
He's up and gone with the sun
Daddy drives an eighteen-wheeler
And he's off on a midwest run
As three sad faces gather round momma
They ask her when daddy's coming home
Daddy drives an eighteen-wheeler
And they sure miss him when he's gone (yeah they do)
Ah, but he calls them everynight
And he tells them that he loves them
And he taught them this song to sing


Well, it's Wednesday evening, momma's waitin by the phone
It rings but it's not his voice
Seems the highway patrol has found a jackknifed rig
In a snow bank in Illinois
But the driver was missing
And the search had been abandoned
Because the weather had everything stalled
And they had checked all the houses and the local motels
When they had some more news they'd call
And she told them when they found him
To tell him that she loved him
And she hung up the phone singing

Momma and the children will be waiting up all night long
Thinking nothing but the worst is coming
With the ringing of the telephone
Oh, but the man upstairs was listening
When momma asked him to bring daddy home
And when the call came in it was daddy on the other end
Asking her if she had been singing the song, singing


Eighteen-wheelerEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Whisper to me softly
Breathe words upon my skin
No one's near and listening
So please don't say goodbye

Just hold me close and love me
Press your lips to mine
Mmm, feels so right, feels so right

Lying here beside you
I hear the echoes of your sighs
Promise me you'll stay with me
And keep me warm tonight

Just hold me close and love me
Give my heart a smile
Mmm, feels so right, feels so right

Your body feels so gentle
And my passion rises high
You're loving me so easy
Your wish is my command
Just hold me close and love me
Tell me it won't end
Mmm, feels so right, feels so right
Feels so right

Oh how you feel so right babyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Life sounds better
Life sounds better
Life sounds better with a southern drawl
Life sounds better
Life sounds better

Here's a song for the southland
Chewin' on Redman
It's been all mornin'
Up in the tree stand
Burgers and hot dogs
Livin' for football
Backwoods battle cry made with a duck call
Life's so simple, like sweet ice tea
Here's our down home recipe

We drive trucks, we drink beer
We shoot whiskey and hunt deer
We say things like yes ma'am and howdy ya'll
Life sounds better with a southern drawl

We got family tradition, good intentions
Get a little crazy, I love our religion
Apple pie, baseball, honky-tonk, dancehall
We mind our manners and we talk real slow
Down here buddy, that's the way it goes

We drive trucks, we drink beer
We shoot whiskey and hunt deer
We say things like yes ma'am and howdy ya'll
Life sounds better with a southern drawl


Country music, mashed potato, nothin' like a ripe tomato
Bible belt to the core, we support our troops at war
Grand Ol' Opry, barbecue, we support Amendment Two
Just about everything is a little better with a twang

We drive trucks, we drink beer
We shoot whiskey and hunt deer
We say things like yes ma'am and howdy ya'll
Life sounds better with a southern drawl
We drive trucks, we drink beer
We shoot whiskey and hunt deer
We say things like yes ma'am and howdy ya'll
Life sounds better with a southern drawl

Life sounds better, life sounds better
Life sounds better, life sounds better
Life sounds better, a lotta, lotta better
Life sounds better, a whole lotta better
Life sounds better, life sounds better, life sounds better
A lotta, lotta better, life sounds better, a whole lotta better
A sure 'nuff a better, life sounds better
Life sounds better with a southern drawl y'allEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We didn't know that times were lean
Round our house the grass was green
It didn't seem like things were all that bad
I bet we walked a thousand miles
Choppin' cotton and pushin' plows
And learnin' how to give it all we had

As life went on and years went by
I saw the light in daddy's eyes
And felt the love in mama's hands
They kept us warm and kept us fed
Taught us how to look ahead
Now lookin' back, I understand

We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced

When Sunday mornings rolled around
We dressed up in hand-me downs
Just in time to gather with the church
Sometimes I think how long it's been
And how it impressed me then
It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work
We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced

We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced

We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We were walking in high cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced
Walkin' in high cottonEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Some glad morning when this life is o'er
I'll fly away
To a home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away (I'll fly away)

I'll fly away, Oh Glory
I'll fly away; (in the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away (I'll fly away)
When the shadows of this life have gone
I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars has flown
I'll fly away (I'll fly away)

Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end
I'll fly away (I'll fly away)

I saw you staring at each other
I saw your eyes begin to glow
And I could tell you once were lovers
But you ain't hiding nothing that I don't know

There's an old flame burning in your eyes
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise
Now that old flame might not be stronger
But it's been burning longer
Than any spark I might have started in your eyes

You said it ended when he left you
You say your love for me is strong
But those old memories still upset you
Well, I might be a memory before too long

The closer you get, the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm falling faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, the further I fall

Brings out the man in me
Do I see a trace in your eyes of love

Because there's something magic
The way that I feel in your arms tonight
