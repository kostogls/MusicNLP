When you came in, the air went out
And every shadow filled up with doubt
I don't know who you think you are
But before the night is through
I wanna do bad things with you
I'm the kind to sit up in his room
Heart sick and eyes filled up with blue
I don't know what you've done to me
But I know this much is true:
I wanna do bad things with you
Ok...
When you came in, the air went out
And all those shadows there, didn't leave any doubt
I don't know who you think you are
But before the night is through
I wanna do bad things with you
I wanna do real bad things with you
(howl)
I don't know what you've done to me
But I know this one thing is true:
I wanna do bad things with you
I wanna do real bad things with you4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well, my ways were always wicked
And I never did believe
That I could ever change
But my angel loves the devil outta me
Never was that much for praying
Then she brought me to my knees
Now there's no shakin' my faith
My angel loves the devil outta me
I'm singin' glory hallelujah, can I get an amen?
Her lovin' feels so good, it oughta be a sin
I was lost but now I'm found, blind but baby, now I see
My angel loves the devil outta me
Well, now she's my kinda heaven
'Cause she knows, knows just what I need
Lord, I swear that I've been saved
My angel loves the devil outta me
I'm singin glory hallelujah, can I get an amen?
Her lovin' feels so good, it oughta be a sin
I was lost but now I'm found, blind but baby, now I see
My angel loves the devil outta me
Show me a man that's a good woman, show me
Show me a man that's a good woman, show me
I'll show you a man who's finally learned how to sing
Show me a man
Show me a man that's a good woman
I'll show you a man who's finally learned how to sing
Sing, sing, I'm singin' glory hallelujah, can I get an amen?
Her lovin' feels so good, it oughta be a sin
I was lost but now I'm found, blind but baby, now I see
My angel loves the devil outta me

I guess I never told you
At least you never heard
Or maybe my heart just got lost
And couldn't find the words
It seems like time's a bandit
It's stolen my last chance
We both heard the music
But didn't dare to dance
And now I see what was meant to be
It slipped right through our hands
All you'll be is a memory
A ghost locked in the past
I'm hummin' 'bout my feelin'
As your love for me grows cold
You and I will surely be
The greatest story never told
It wasn't in an instant
A once upon a time
How could something so priceless
Just turn on a dime?
I've tried so hard to hate you
And I've tried to let you go
I've tried to find a reason
There isn't one I know
Now I see what was meant to be
It slipped right through our hands
All you'll be is a memory
A ghost locked in the past
I'm hummin' 'bout my feelin'
As your love for me grows cold
You and I will surely be
The greatest story never told
I'm hummin' 'bout my feelin'
As your love for me grows cold
You and I will surely be
The greatest story never told
The greatest story never toldEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm bouncin' off the wall like an ol' Jack Rabbitt
My heartbeats racin' outta control
Well I'm in to you like an old bad habit
Well I feel like a pris'ner just got paroled
I gotta have it
I'm an addict
You know that I can never give you up
My hands are shakin'
My body's achin'
For ev'ry single drop of your love
In my condition there's no remission
Baby your my favorite drug
I cain't function
You got somethin'

Well you look so good given' me the jitters
Honey I'm on fire ev'ry time we touch
Like a lifetime chain smoker I'm a no quitter

Crawled from the wreckage and sprung myself a leak
Took down the bottle and poured it in the sink
I crossed myself one time
Raised up and prayed for rain
Hid the compartment of a long-lost Memphis train
You might remember me I was your next of kin
You've gotta help me, babe
I think I'm one of them
There's a god above you, another down below
Come greet the day there's just one thing you oughta know
What happens next, don't think anyone can say
But when it gets you, you'd best get out of the way
You made a promise, babe
To love me to the end
And you can't back out now
Just 'cause I'm one of them
Caine split the atom and he laid it in my bed
I changed the sheets and built a fire there instead
I climbed the ladder straight up into Jacob's room
Sat on his bed and gave myself a talking to
I read Revelations Chapter One until the End
Who's gonna save me now
Looks like I'm one of them
I read Revelations Chapter One until the End
Who's gonna save me now
Looks like I'm one of them
Ow!
Oh!
You gotta save me, baby!
I thought, I thought
I thought you said we was friends!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She didn't smoke last Tuesday
Didn't even take a sip
It's Wednesday night, she's bumming butts
And sinking like a ship
She came to at the tiger mart
An orange in her hand
A hundred miles from anywhere
Her pockets full of sand
Living the good life
In the summertime
Flying so high
Living the good life
He ain't sunk an eight ball
In at least as many years
But all that really kept him safe
Is circumstance and fear
He woke up with a nosebleed
And a pounding in his head
A naked woman twice his age
Lay scattered 'cross the bed
Living the good life
In the summertime
Flying so high
Living the good life
Eighty thousand dollars
For a new Mercedes Benz
Used to ride the market
Like a vulture on the wind
It's funny how 8 cylinders
Don't hardly make no sound
The last he ever heard
Was that garage door going down
Living the good life
In the summertime
Flying so high
Living the good life
Ain't this a good life
In the summertime
We're flying so high
Ain't this a good lifeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

[Verse 1}
Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on thats soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand
{Chorus}
Ive been thinkin bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man
{ Verse 2}
Theres no hurry don't you worry
We can take our time
Come a little closer
Lets go over what I had in mind
Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on thats soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

Preacher says I need a woman washed in the blood
That lead me down that straight and narrow way
Mamma says I need a girl who will settle down
Have a son to carry on my family name
When I look at you its plain to me
You ain't got nothing that I need
But baby you got everything I want
I hear the radio singing about an endless kind of love
There's a good chance you'll be gone before daylight
Man in the mirror says you're gonna be hard to hold
And those strawberry lips might be my death tonight
Well I look at you its plain to me
You ain't got nothing that I need
But baby you got everything I want
Five foot ten, sun-kissed skin
You oughta be a crime
Head to toe you tend my soul
Like a taste of sweet moonshine
Anyone on Earth can see
You're no good for me
But baby you got everything I want
Why do I run my fingers through your hair?
And tell me why can't I get close enough?
Lookin' in those Carolina eyes
Is like staring down the barrel of a gun
Like fruit on that forbidden tree
You ain't got nothing that I need
But baby you got everything ...
Five foot ten, sun-kissed skin
You oughta be a crime
Head to toe you tend my soul
Like a taste of sweet moonshine
Anyone on Earth can see
You're no good for me
But baby you got everything I want
What you got ain't what I need
But darlin' that's alright with me
'Cause baby you got everything I want
Everything I want
Everything I wantEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hey, what 'cha doin' tonight?
What about if I stop by?
We could watch a little movie
Make a little mem'ry
Baby, wouldn't that be nice?
If I make you and you make me
Oh, just a little less lonely
Uh, huh
Now, we could dress up to the nines
Blue jeans would suit me fine
You know we've always been good friends
That'll never have to end
Even if we cross that line
And I'll make you and you'll make me
Oh, just a little less lonely
Hey baby, why don't we give it a try?
Yeah, 'cuz I think you'll like what I've got in mind
Yeah…..yeah
Whoo!
Now we can talk, all night long
Dance to your favorite song
If you got a little crazy
You know it wouldn't faze me
'Cuz baby there ain't nothing wrong
If I make you and you make me
Mmmm, just a little less lonely
Wouldn't it be nice to be
Oh, just a little less lonely?
Uh, huh
Just a little less lonely. (A little less lonely, less lonely)
Just a little less lonely. (A little less lonely, less lonely)

I had to pack it up
I just wasn't worth a dime today
Boss won't miss me much:
Hell, I wasn't really there anyway
I been lost in your arms an' your touch an' your kiss
Since I left you at six a.m
'Cause that's the kinda love I'm in
That's the kinda love I'm in
I was makin' good time:
Couldn't wait to get here to you
Oh, man I was flyin'
When my front went right in a right back blue
And I probably shoulda stopped
Probably looked like a fool tearin' up these $400 rims
But that's the kinda love I'm in
That's the kinda love I'm in
An' nobody's ever wanted nobody
The way I want you
An' there's somethin' 'bout every little thing about you:
There's nothin' I wouldn't do
Wanna stand for you, fall for you, live for you, die for you:
Don't want you out from under my skin
'Cause that's the kinda love I'm in
That's the kinda love I'm in
I can't turn it off
Why would I if I could?
Man, I love the thought
Of you on my mind for good
And bearin' my soul with the truth like this
Might be steppin' out there, too far on a limb
But that's the kinda love I'm in
'Cause nobody's ever wanted nobody
The way I want you
An' there's somethin' 'bout every little thing about you:
There's nothin' I wouldn't do
Wanna stand for you, fall for you, live for you, die for you:
Don't want you out from under my skin

One, two, one, two, three, four
Tonight give me something I can use
We're driving ourselves mad soaking the same ol' blues
Go into the store, take a bottle off the shelf
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
Rush back home, crawl in bed, pour that bottle all over yourself
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
We're gonna get a little sticky, get a little weird
Making my old woman let me know we're still here
Get a little action, I don't care what it is
I know, there's more to life than this
I know, there's more to life than this
Alright, listen, fold up that card table
We're gonna need the extra space
Baby, take off that apron
Throw that apron in the fireplace
Do you know what day it is
(C'mon, c'mon)
Or do I have to tell you again?
(C'mon, c'mon)
It's the second Friday of the month, baby
(C'mon, c'mon)
And I ship come in
(C'mon, c'mon)
We're gonna get a little sticky, get a little weird
Making my old woman let me know we're still here
Get a little action, I don't care what it is
I know, there's more to life than this
Get a little sticky, get a little weird
Making my old woman let me know we're still here
Get a little action, I don't care what it is
I know, there's more, there's more to life than this
There's more to life than this
Turn off that TV, baby
Just turn it off, gonna make our own
Baby, turn it off, open a window
Stick your head out, let 'em know
We're here, there's more to life than this

There's more to life than this

Well you hate the way I shuffle
But you love the way I deal
You don't mind if I borrow
But you'd rather watch me steal
You take what you've forgiven
And you put it in a drug
In case you need it later
Just to even up the score
Chorus:
Oh, oh, how did we get in to this mess?
Oh, I know, gotta get you out
Out of that little black dress
We get up and join the circus
Take this show out on the road (come on, let's go)
Girl if you wanna keep the light on
You got to pay'em what they own (I know, I know)
Yeah you're often planting flowers
Are they ever gonna bloom?
I'm up here with a guitar and another empty room
(chorus)
Come on
Baby you put me in the corner
But girl I haven't done a thing
Yeah you give me all the answers
But I don't know what they mean
You say you'll take me places
Show me things I've never seen
Say baby start the engine and then you hide the keys
Oh, oh, how did we get in to this mess?
Oh, I know, gotta get you, gotta get you, wanna get you out of that
Oh, oh, how did we get in to this mess?
Oh, I know, gotta get you out, out of that little black dress
Wanna see your hair all in a mess
That little black dress, come on
Just let it fall to the floor
You ain't gonna need those high heeled sneakers no more

Heywood was a daddy in 1942
He couldn't read or make his letters
He said "Boy I hope you don't do like I did"
That was my dad he was talking to
So my father grew up stronger
Bigger dreams and bigger plans
The first to go to college
But he can still work hard with his two hands
Thanks to his old man
Yeah he learned to throw a baseball
How to sail a ishing line
He learned about forgiveness
'Cause you just can't waste the time
And the circle goes unbroken
But there's so much left undone
That's just how it is
Between a father and a son
Well I became a daddy
At the age of twenty-three
I didn't know what I was doing
That my daddy would have done in place of me
I felt lost at sea
So I just kept it simple
Took it one day at a time
Followed the foot-steps
Of the men who came before me in my life
We're doing just fine
'Cause you learn to throw a baseball
How to sail a ishing line
And you learn about forgiveness
'Cause you just can't waste the time
And the circle goes unbroken
But there's so much left undone
That's just how it is
Between a father and a son
And the circle goes unbroken
But there's so much left undone
That's just how it is
Oh that's just how it is
Between a father and a son
Between a father and a son
Between a father and a sonEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Half of my mistakes I made stone cold sober
Half of my mistakes I made at closing time
Half the time I never saw it coming until it was over
Yeah, half of my mistakes I made put love on the line
Half of my mistakes I made 'cause I was moving too quickly
Yeah, half of 'em were made 'cause my heart was moving to slow
Nobody can tell you a damn thing if you ain't listening
Half of my mistakes I made because I couldn't let go
And if I had it all to do over
I'd probably win and lose just as much
Spend less time on right and wrong and a lot more time on love
And if I had it all to do over
I'd probably win and lose just as much
Spend less time on right and wrong and a lot more time on love
Half of my mistakes I’d give anything to change how it ended
Half of my mistakes, God I wouldn't change a thing
You can lean too hard on regrets but I don't recommend it
'Cause half the good things in my life came from half of my mistakes
Yeah a lotta good things in my life came from half my mistakes
Half my mistakes.....
Half my mistakes.....
Half my mistakes.....EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

And the Jesus ties that groove me

A big chunk of trouble in a field

You had a moan that kept on sticking
We're both maple syrup sweet

Taste the dust, taste the rust and the sin
Lean into the wind
We ain't comin' back again
You got an itch that needed scratchin'
I got a plan that I been hatchin'
When the moon goes down
We gonna drag this town out in the road
You got the devil in your detail
We been dancing on the third rail

I been up and down this lonely town
Never found what I was needing
Running out of leads and possibilities
Never thought I'd see just what I'm seeing
It took a while to get through
All of my bad luck
Ever since I met you
I feel like I've just struck gold
Baby, when it comes to love
You know you've got the Midas touch
It's gold

Is 24 carat through and through
Just keep on doin' what you're doin'

How you say my name
That magic way, your kisses linger
That sexy laugh
And that look you have
It's all got me wrapped around your finger

Don't wanna close my eyes

Watching you shine like gold

Late at night and all I can do
Is walk these streets and think of you
Time goes by but not for me
So easy to preach, but hard to believe
I'm damned if I do
And damned if I don't want you
To taste your lips, to touch your skin
Pull you close and drink you in
I should let you go but I don't know how
I'm no good for you and I'm nothing without
Yeah, I'm damned if I do
But damned if I don't want you
It's late at night. All I can do
Is walk these streets and dream of you
Yeah, I'm damned if I don't
Damned if I do
But damned if I don't want you

My lips don't move as I scream your name
I want you, my love

Call my name without a sound

Here they come down my street
He's standin' there where I use to be
Look at that stupid grin on his face
Don't he look so out of place?
Poor thing, he can't help himself
Just let him have his turn
But baby, you and I both know
Some gifts can't be returned
He not a permanent thing
The night we met, that's all it took
By the cigarette machine
With the babbling brook
I was lookin' at you
You were lookin' right back
Got down on one knee
And made you laugh
I don't really blame you, girl
For messing with his head
I know that you'll be back before
I see that boy again
