I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today

Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars
Like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther, I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again

I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today

Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for tequila and pretty señoritas
I'd have no reason to stay
Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
Going to lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play
Four days flew by like a drunk Friday night
As the summer drew to an end
They can't believe that I just couldn't leave
And I bid adieu to my friends
Cause my bartender, she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
And I don't know if it's her or the rum

I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today

Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Yes, and all the muchachas, they call me big papa
When I throw pesos their way
Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jaeger
And I'll grab my guitar and play

Adios and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay
The señoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero
Yeah, I got no money to stay
Adios and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay

I'm just going to drive up by the lake
And put my ass in a lawn chair, toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world, a PBR on the way
Life is good today, life is good today10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door 'fore the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
She's answered by the taillights shinin' through the window pane

He said, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said, you're ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'

At a truck stop diner, just outside of Lincoln
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same old light is shinin'
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him

He said, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said, you're ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'
Born for leavin'
Well, it's a windin' road
When you're in the lost and found
You're a lover, I'm a runner
And we go 'round and 'round
And I love you, but I leave you
I don't want you, but I need you
You know it's you that calls me back here, baby

Oh, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
'Cause I'm a ramblin' man
I ain't ever gonna change
I've got a gypsy soul to blame
And I was born for leavin'
Born for leavin'

When I close my eyes I see you
No matter where I am
I can smell your perfume through these whisperin' pines
I'm with your ghost again
It's a shame about the weather
But I know soon we'll be together
And I can't wait 'til then
I can't wait 'til then16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast
To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love


I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love28EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Going to put the the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine going to wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I farted
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way

Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away

Now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be

Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Come on in the water's nice
Find yourself a little slice
Grab a back, pack it light
You never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find the key to paradise10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I got a piece of land out in the countryside
Lay back and smell the sun warm up the Georgia pine
Feels so good to be taking it easy
Why would I ever leave? 'Cause I know

I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good lookin' woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town where it feels like home
I've got everything I need and nothing that I don't
Homegrown
Homegrown

We got a fire goin' down by the riverside
Sip whiskey out the bottle, livin' like we'll never die
Come on and stay a while if you don't believe me
Why would I ever leave? 'Cause I know

I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good lookin' woman with her arms 'round me
Here in a small town where it feels like home

Hometown hero at the bar
Burned out high life super star
You know
Kept a buzz to fill the hole
Loved the lights and stole the show

Someone I used to know
Would stay another round
Someone I used to know
Ran himself in the ground

It’s been a long time comin’
Couldn’t keep on runnin’
Had to hit rock bottom to know
When you keep on losin’
With the path you’re choosin’
And it’s time to let go
Of someone that I used to know

Know, know
Know, know
Someone that I used to know
Rides the high that tears him down
Hates himself and loves the crowd
The king of fools, a heavy crown
He didn’t know he almost drowned

Someone I used to know
Would stay another round
Someone I used to know
Ran himself in the ground

I got a death wish
Her looks can kill
She's got a red dress
Lipstick and heels
Pull me in
Get me hooked like a junkie
You got me feeling so high

You’re such a beautiful drug
I can't get enough
Addicted and I'm dying for a hit of your love
Got a death wish baby, baby
Don't want you to save me, save me

She lets her hair down
And all of mine stand up
Can't help but stare now
Gotta feel that touch
Her kiss, my fix, so sweet
Can't quit those lips are a habit to me
Sweet intoxication and I'm never getting sober
I can tell that the effects are taking over
Pull me in, get me hooked like a junkie
You got me feeling so high tonight
You're such a beautiful drug
I can't get enough
I'm addicted and dying for a hit of your love
Got a death wish baby, baby
Don't want you to save me, save me tonight

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

You're such a beautiful drug
I can't get enough
I'm addicted and dying for a hit of your love
I'm losing it baby
Keep driving me crazy, crazy

Going out of my mind staring at you
Burning up in your fire that I’ve fallen into
Got a death wish baby, baby
Don't want you to save me, save me tonight

I wish you love
And happiness
I guess I wish
You all the best
I wish you don't
Do like I do
And go and fall in love with someone like you
Cause if you fell
Oh, like I did
You'd probably walk around the block like a little kid
But a kid don't know
He could only guess
How hard it is
To wish you happiness
Well I guess love
Is like a Christmas card
You decorate a tree
And throw it in the yard
It decays and dies
And the snowmen melt
Well I knew love
I knew how love felt
I knew love
Oh, and love knew me
When I walked around, love walked with me
But I got no hate
And I got no pride
But I got so much love that I cannot hide
So you drive a Chevy
So you drive a Ford
So you drive around all night till you just get bored
Then you change your mind
For something else to do
Then your heart changes your mind and it changes you
I wish you love
And happiness
I guess I wish
You all the best
I wish you don't
Do like I do
And go and fall in love with someone like you
If you fell
Oh, like I did
You'd probably walk around the block like a little kid
But a kid don't know
He could only guess
How hard it is
To wish you happiness

He was a giant
And I was just a kid
I was always trying
To do everything he did
I can still remember every lesson he taught me
Growing up learning how to be like my old man

He was a lion
We were our father's pride
But I was defiant
When he made me walk the line
He knew how to lift me up
And when to let me fall
Looking back, he always had a plan
My old man

My old man
Feel the callous on his hands
And dusty overalls
My old man
Now I finally understand
I have a lot to learn
From my old man
Now I'm a giant
Got a son of my own
He's always trying
To go everywhere I go
Do the best I can to raise him up the right way
Hoping that he someday wants to be
Like his old man


My old man
I know one day we'll meet again
As he's looking down
My old man
I hope he's proud of who I am
I'm trying to fill the boot of my old man

Can't tell where the sky begins and the water ends
No clouds to hide the sun
Waves playing me a symphony upon the sand
As I lay drifting on the ocean with this bottle in my hand
Sat down on the boardwalk for a little while
Your memory my company
Something 'bout this place had a way to make you smile
You always loved the sound of waves
The wind whistling 'cross my bottle still can’t blow away the sorrow
That tomorrow you won't be here with me
So I raise it up and toast the day we met
Won't forget the way you love me, amazing way you love me

It's bittersweet, you see
You're not here but I can feel you
Every memory is on the tip of my tongue
Close my eyes, see your face, hold on tight to yesterday
And when I wake, it was just a dream
It's bittersweet
Doctor said there's nothing we can do
Took my hand said, "Take me home
To the only place half a chance to take the pain away
Let me feel alive before I go"
You said, "Life is only borrowed
So let's wash away our sorrow
That tomorrow I won’t be here with you
Go and live your life with no regrets
And don’t forget how much I love you
I love you"

It's bittersweet, you see
You're not here but I can feel you
Every memory is on the tip of my tongue
Close my eyes, see your face, hold on tight to yesterday
Praying when I wake, it was just a dream
It's bittersweet
I brought you back just like you wanted
So you don't ever have to leave
And when I poured you across the southern sky
I couldn't help but to cry
I know you finally got your wings
Bitter-bittersweet
Bittersweet
Oh
The wind whistling across my bottle
Still can't blow away the sorrow
That tomorrow you won’t be here with me
So I raise it up and toast the day we met
Won't forget the way you love me, amazing way you love me
It's bittersweet6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I ride east every other Friday but if I had it my way
The day would not be wasted on this drive
And I want so bad to hold you
Son, there's things I haven't told you
Your mom and me couldn't get along

So I'll drive
And I think about my life
And wonder why, That I slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line and I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride

A day might come and you'll realize that if you could see through my eyes
There was no other way to work it out
And a part of you might hate me
But son please don't mistake me for a man that didn't care at all

And I'll drive
And I'll think about my life
And wonder why, That I slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line and I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride

So when you drive
And the years go flying by
I hope you smile
If I ever cross your mind
It was a pleasure of my life
And I cherished every time
And my whole world
It begins and ends with you
On that Highway 20 ride3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Every morning when you come downstairs
Hair's a mess but I don't care
No makeup on and shining so bright
My old sweatshirt never fit so right
Dancing around to the radio
Humming the words that you don't know
Cross out finding an angel off my list
Thinking that it don't get no better than this

You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

Wrapped around me late at night
Pillow talk by candle light
Gonna slow this down and make it last
The best things fly by us so fast

You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Oh, I wanna sing it again

You make loving you easy
You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes
Loving you easy

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

Black dog drinks from the water trying to cool his tongue
Like the king, finds no peace, his work is never done
Night falls, smoke on the water, darkness closes in
Cold white hand in the deep will drown you for your sins

It's a life long expedition
Second guessing your decisions
Trying to find out what's been missing
Pages keep on filling

Crying out "Go and wake the king"
Call to arms for those who kiss the ring
Stand your ground, the walls are coming down
It's do or die! Do or die!

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Mad man, blood on the altar, The Queen will have his head
His ghost will shake those rattling chains long after he's dead
No soul knows his trouble high upon his throne
Loved by few and judged by many, he bears that weight alone

It's a life long expedition
Second guessing your decisions
Trying to find out what's been missing
And the pages keep on filling

Crying out "Go and wake the king"
Call to arms for those who kiss the ring
Stand your ground, yeah the walls are coming down
It's do or die! Do or die!

She's got eyes that cut you like a knife
And lips that taste like sweet red wine
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in a room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees

She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
And every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is

You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
People ask me what it is
I tell them I don't know
There's just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
She's gonna be my wife
She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say

When she loves me I'm on top of the world
Because when she loves me I can live forever
When she loves me I am untouchable

We never spoke a word, but every thought she had, I heard
From across the room
If we were standin' face to face, I couldn't find the words to say
Give me one more move

I don't even know her name

Now I'm fallin' in love as she's walkin' away
And my heart won't tell my mind
To tell my mouth what it should say
We may have lost this battle, live to fight another day

Wise man next to me did say, 'bout the one that got away

Don't you let regret take place of the dreams you have to chase
Ask her to dance, go on son

Roll the dice and have some faith
And don't be fallin' in love as she's walkin' away

Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
I wanna be a castaway
And leave the world behind
Take a tropic holiday
Say goodbye to keeping time
Wasting away down by the coast
Pacifico and chasing lime
Easy living down in paradise
Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
Just like the other one
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight
I'm in an island state of mind
Don't think I’m ever gonna leave
I'd rather stay and watch the waves
Move the sand beneath my feet
Reggae on the radio
Laying low and feeling high
Easy living down in paradise
Pour me another one
Make it a strong one
We're gonna have some fun tonight
Just like the other one
Make it a double rum
We're gonna castaway tonight

Castaway
Ride the waves like we’re young
'Cause time flies by and soon we'll be older
It's better to live in the moment
Than stuck in the past
Fast asleep as the world passes by
Ay ay yo
Where reality is history
Oh yo eh
Come and castaway with me
Ay ay yo
The good times are free and
Nobody can take that away
Oh yo eh
Come and castaway with me
Pour me another one
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been)
Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight
(For a little while I’ll be a castaway
Gonna let the sun shine in)
Just like the other one
(Smiling in the islands, I’ve been)
Make it a double rum
We’re gonna castaway tonight
(For a little while I’ll be a castaway
Gonna let the sunshine in)
Pour me another one

Make it a strong one
We’re gonna have some fun tonight

Gonna let the sunshine in)
Just like the other one

It was in a crystal bottle on his desk
He'd save it for the times to not forget
I missed the way he'd share with me
The things that he held true
While the lessons rolled around his 80 proof
All it took was...

One sip and it blew my mind
Those good ol' boys sure make it right
Knowing smooth whiskey takes some time
Ain't nothing like the real thing
And you can't go back once you get a taste
Everything is second rate
I'm talking genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing

Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing like the...
Real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing baby

I thought I'd been in love a time or two
Didn't know that I was lost till I met you
And I could tell that every other girl was history
Never knew how real could feel till you found me
All it took was...
One kiss, and you blew my mind
An All-American kind of fine
You a know a, good woman is hard to find
Ain't nothing like the real thing
And you can't go back once you get a taste
Everyone is second rate
I'm talking genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing

There ain't nothing like the real thing baby
There ain't nothing like the...

There ain't nothing like the...

You know a, great song is hard to find
The right words and the perfect rhyme
'Cause we, all feel the same inside
We're all looking for the real thing
You know you're not the same once you hear it play
There's nothing else that can replace
What's genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing
I'm talking genuine Made in the USA
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I saw the sun begin to dim
And felt that winter wind blow cold
A man learns who is there for him
When the glitter fades and the walls won't hold
'Cause from then, rubble
What remains can only be what's true
If all was lost, it's more I've gained
'Cause it led me back to you

And from now on, these eyes will not be blinded by the lights
From now on, what's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight, tonight
And let this promise in me start like an anthem in my heart
From now on, from now on

I drank champagne with kings and queens
The politicians praised my name
But those are someone else's dreams
The pitfalls of the man I became
For years and years, I chased their cheers
At the crazy speed of always needing more
But when I stop and see you here
I remember who all this was for
And from now on, these eyes will not be blinded by the lights
And from now on, what's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight
It starts tonight
And let this promise in me start like an anthem in my heart
From now on, from now on, from now on

And we will come back home
And we will come back home, home again
And we will come back home
And we will come back home, home again
And we will come back home
And we will come back home, home again

From now on, these eyes will not be blinded by the lights
And from now on, what's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight
It starts tonight
And let this promise in me start like an anthem in my heart
From now on, from now on, from now on

And we will come back home
And we will come back home, home again
And we will come back home
And we will come back home, home again
From now on, from now on, home again1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

My first best friend was a 6 string
Took him with me everywhere I go
When I was 18, bought a Dodge van
Found a drummer and made the road my home

Ooh, I wouldn't change a thing
It made the man I am today

My roots always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home

Every Friday, you could find me
At Dixie Tavern, playin' with my band
We'd start the show with a round of whiskey
And play our hearts out and wished it'd never end

Ooh, I wouldn't change a thing
It made the man I am today
My roots always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home

We'd get 'em singin' "Don't Stop Believing"
Then follow up with a cold beer on a Friday night
Always dreamin' one day we'd play with
All our heroes we cover every night

Flyin' high all our dreams came true
You've given me wings

And roots, always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home
My roots, always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
My roots, even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only makes you stronger
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only makes you stronger
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only makes you stronger
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only makes you stronger
Don't give up
Hold on a little longer
What don't kill you
Only gives you stronger roots1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
