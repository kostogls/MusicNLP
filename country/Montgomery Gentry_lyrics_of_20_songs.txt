This ain't no temporary, typical, tearful goodbye
This ain't no breakin' up, then wakin' up and makin' up one more time
This is gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone), gone

Gone like a freight train
Gone like yesterday
Gone like a soldier in the Civil War
Bang Bang!
Gone like a '59 Cadillac
Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back
She's gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone), gone
She's gone!

This ain't no 'give it time, I'm hurtin' but maybe we can work it out'
Won't be no champagne, red rose, romance, second chance
This is gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone), gone

Gone like a freight train
Gone like yesterday
Gone like a soldier in the Civil War
Bang Bang!
Gone like a '59 Cadillac
Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back
She's gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone), gone
She's gone!
This is gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone), gone
Gone like a freight train
Gone like yesterday
Gone like a soldier in the Civil War
Bang Bang!
Gone like a '59 Cadillac
Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back
She's gone (gone)
She's gone (gone)
She's gone (gone)
She's gone!
She's gone!
Gone like a freight train
Gone like yesterday
Gone like a soldier in the Civil War
Bang Bang!
Gone like a '59 Cadillac
Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back
She's gone
Long gone, don't be wrong, never comin' back, my baby's gone
She's gone
Wanna get home, sittin' alone, so pack your bags, and now she's gone
Never comin' back, she's gone
No, no, never
No, no, never
No, no, never
No, no, never comin' back

There's a story that my daddy tells religiously
Like clockwork every time he see's an opening
In a conversation, 'bout the way things used to be

Well I just roll my eyes and make a B-line for the door
But I'd always end up starry eyed and cross legged on the floor
Hanging onto every word, man the things I heard

It was harder times and longer days
Five miles to school uphill both ways
We were cane-switch raised and dirt floor poor
Course that was back before the war

Yea your uncle and I made quite a pair
Flying F-15's through hostile air
He went down but they missed me by a hair
He'd always stop right there and say

That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chins held high as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a flying
Or a new born baby crying
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of
Son graduating college, that was momma's dream
And I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned eighteen
Cause when you got a fast car, and think you got everything

I learned real quick those GTO's don't run off faith
I ended up broken down in some town north of L.A
Working maximum hours, for minimum wage

Well I fell in love next thing I know
The babies came and the car got sold
Sure do miss that old Hot Rod
But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs

Dad I wonder if I ever let you down
If you're ashamed how I turned out
Well he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow
Said let me tell you right now

That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
You don't need to make a million just be thankful to be working
If you're doing what you're able
Putting food there on the table
And providing for the family that you love
That's something to be proud of
And if all you ever really do is the best you can
Well, you did it man

That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chins held high as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a flying
Or a new born baby crying
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of

That's something to be proud of
Now that's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of
Now that's something to be proud of1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Don't you dare go runnin' down my little town where I grew up
And I won't cuss your city lights
If you ain't ever took a ride around and cruised right through the heart of my town
Anything you say would be a lie

We may live our lives a little slower
But that don't mean I wouldn't be proud to show ya

Where I come from
There's an old plow boy out turnin' up dirt
Where I come from
There's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
Where I come from
Where a couple of boys fight in the parkin' lot
No, nobody's gonna call the cops
Where I come from

See that door right there, man, I swear that it ain't never been locked
And I guarantee that it never will
That old man right there in the rockin' chair at the courthouse square, I'll tell you now
He could buy your fancy car with hundred dollar bills
Don't let those faded overalls fool ya
He made his millions without one day of schoolin'

Where I come from
There's a pickup truck with the tailgate down
Where I come from
The pine trees are singin' a song of the south
Where I come from
That little white church is gonna have a crowd
And yeah, I'm pretty damn proud
Of where I come from

Where I come from
There's a big ol' moon shinin' down at night
Where I come from
There's a man done wrong, gonna make it right

Where I come from
There's an old plow boy out turnin' up dirt
Where I come from
There's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
Where I come from
Where a couple of boys fight in the parkin' lot
No, ain't nobody gonna call the cops
Yeah, that river runs across that old flint rock

Growin' up I remember one year
My uncle Titus had a bright idear (oh yeah)
He's gonna bottle up his own brew
Figured he could make a million or two
Taste wasn't gonna be his claim to fame (aww naw)
What he was bankin' on was all in the name

Just the thing to get you grinnin' ear to ear
Whether you're from the country or the big ol' city
One things for sure everybody loves Titty's

He had his marketing plan worked up
He's gonna sell 'em all in big ol' jugs (ha ha ha ha)
He wouldn't package 'em in a six pack
He's gonna sell 'em by the pair and call it a rack
And he was sure it was the next big thing (aww yeah)
With Dolly Parton in his ad campaign
Selling

I'm getting older
Finding myself and God getting a little bit closer
And Sober
I'm a little less reckless, little less wild card
Breaking hearts kinda senseless
Yeah, I'm coming around

I might cuss and fight, tell a few lies
Break a few rules, making promises I can't keep
But I've turned the page on wilder days
I'm writing all this down hoping you'll see
I ain't saying I'm perfect, but I'm working on a better me

I say I'm sorry
Sometimes it's the hardest part to tell somebody
But baby I'm sorry
Yeah I've been praying
Coming from me that might sound a little bit crazy
But I swear I'm changing

I might cuss and fight, tell a few lies
Break a few rules, making promises I can't keep
But I've turned the page on wilder days
I'm running all this down hoping you'll see
I ain't saying I'm perfect, but I'm working on a better me yeah
Didn't wanna call you up
Didn't wanna just stop
Wanted to take my time and make sure I got every word right

Yeah, I still cuss and fight
Tell you lies
Break a few rules, making promises I can't keep

Mom got drunk and dad got drunk
At our Christmas party
We were drinkin' champagne punch
And homemade eggnog
Little sister brought her new boyfriend
He was a Mexican
We didn't know what to think of him
'Til he sang Feliz Navidad
Feliz Navidad

Brother Ken brought his kids with him
The three from his first wife Lynn
And the two identical twins
From his second wife Mary Nell
Of course he brought his new wife Kay
Who talks all about AA
Chain smokin' while the stereo plays
Noel, Noel, The first Noel

Carve the turkey turn the ballgame on
Mix Margaritas when the eggnog's gone
Send somebody to the Quik-Pak store
We need some ice and an extension cord
A can of bean dip and some Diet Rite
A box of Pampers, some Marlboro Lights
Hallelujah everybody say cheese
Merry Christmas from the family
Fran and Rita drove from Harlingen
I can't remember how I'm kin to them
But when they tried to plug their motor home in
They blew our Christmas lights
Cousin David knew just what went wrong
So we all waited out on our front lawn
He threw the breaker and the lights came on
And we sang Silent Night
Silent Night o' holy night

Carve the turkey turn the ballgame on
Mix Bloody Marys 'cause we all want one
Send somebody to the Stop 'n Go
We need some celery and a can of fake snow
A bag of lemons and some Diet Sprite
A box of Midol, some Salem Lights
Hallelujah everybody say cheese
Merry Christmas from the family

He works way too much
For way too little
He drinks way too early 'til
Way too late
He hasn't had a raise
Since New Year's Day
In eighty-eight
Gets trampled on by everyone, 'cept
When he comes in here

And he's the product
Of the Haggard generation
He's got a redneck side
When you get him agitated
He got the gold toothed look
From a stiff right hook
He's proud he took
For his right wing stand on Vietnam
Says he lost his brother there

He yells out Johnny Cash
And the band starts to play
A-ring of fire as he walks up
And stands there by the stage
And he says
A-hell yeah!
A-turn it up!
A-right on!
A-hell yeah!
A-sounds good!
Sing that song!
A guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
Life was good and love was easy

She's got an MBA and a plush corner office
She's got a don't mess with me attitude
She'll close a deal
She don't reveal that she can feel
The loneliness the emptiness
'cept when she comes in here

And she's the product of the Me generation
She's got a rock and roll side
When you get her agitated
She got the tattoo there
On her derriere
From a spring break dare in Panama
Where love was all she thought she'd ever need
She yells out to the band
Know any Bruce Springsteen?
Then she jumps up on the bar
And she, and she starts to scream
She says

Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
A-right on!
A-hell yeah!
A-sounds good!
Sing that song!
A guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
Life was good

Can or can't you get my mind off thinkin' 'bout
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Hey, hell yeah!

3:02 - 3:24
Hell yeah

Right on

I have days where I hate my job
This little town and the whole world too
And last Sunday when my Bengals lost
Lord, it put me in a bad mood

I have moments when I curse the rain
But then complain when the sun's too hot
I look around at what everyone has
And I forget about all I've got

But I know I'm a lucky man
God's given me a pretty fair hand
Got a house and piece of land
A few dollars in a coffee can

My old truck's still runnin' good
My ticker's tickin' like they say it should
I've got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovin'
And one more day to be my little kid's dad
Lord knows I'm a lucky man

Got some friends who would be here fast
I could call 'em any time of day
Got a brother who's got my back
Got a mama who I swear's a saint
Got a brand new rod and reel
Got a full week off this year
Dad had a close call last spring
It's a miracle he's still here

But I know I'm a lucky man
God's given me a pretty fair hand
Got a house and piece of land
A few dollars in a coffee can

My old truck's still runnin' good
My ticker's tickin' like they say it should
I've got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovin'
And one more day to be my little kids dad
Lord knows I'm a lucky man

Woh, my old truck's still runnin' good
My ticker's tickin' like they say it should

And even my bad days ain't that bad

There's a for sale sign on a big old rusty tractor
You can't miss it, It's the first thing that you see
Just up the road, a pale blue water tower
With "I Love Jenny" painted in bright green
Hey that's my Uncle Bill there by the courthouse
He'll be lowering the flag when the sun goes down

And this is my town
(Nana na na na)
Yeah this is my town
(Nana na na na)
Hey!

Where I was born
Where I was raised
Where I keep all my yesterdays
Where I ran off cause I got mad

It's where they'll put me in the ground
Yeah this is My town

But come Sunday morning service at the Church of Christ
Well there ain't an empty seat to be found

And this is My town

And if we want a seat we better leave right now

Golden Tee, shuffleboard, pinball, he's got the score
That everybody around here's tryin to beat
He's a six pack up when he walks in
Tells the band crank it up to 10
Then he's up dancin on his seat
Well he's a big mouth, yellin' hey play some free bird
Says give me three steps and nobody gets hurt
Then he takes off his shirt

There's one in every crowd
Brings the party in us out
Good time Charley with a Harley, whiskey bent and hellbound
He's got the next round, but he always drinks for free
There's one in every crowd, and it's usually me
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd
Got a fliptop box of Marlboros
He'll bum a light and steal your girl
Then laugh at you for gettin' all upset, well everybody here knows his name
Makes everybody else look sane
When he's out, as far as you can get
In his mind he's a rock star, crankin' out that air guitar
Til the bartender says fool, get off my bar

There's one in every crowd
That brings the party in us out
Good time charley with a harley, whiskey bent and hellbound
He's got the next round, but he always drinks for free
There's one in every crowd, and it's usually me
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd
He's a hard drinkin man's man
And women love him when they can
He's a bartender's best friend
It ain't a party till he walks in

I'm tired of spinning my wheels
I need to find a place where my heart can go to heal
I need to get there pretty quick
Hey mister what you got out on that lot you can sell me in a pinch
Maybe one of them souped up muscle cars
The kind that makes you think you're stronger than you are
Color don't matter no I don't need leather seats
All that really concerns me is
Speed
How fast will it go
Can it get me
Over her quickly
Zero to sixty
Can it outrun her memory
Yeah, what I really need
Is an open road
And a whole lot of speed
I'd like to trade in this old truck
Cause it makes me think of her and that just slows me up
See, it's the first place we made love where we used to sit and talk
On the tailgate all night long but now she's gone
And I need to move on
So give me
Speed
How fast will it go
Can it get me
Over her quickly
Zero to sixty
Can it outrun her memory
Yeah, what I really need
Is an open road
And a whole lot of speed
Throw me them keys so I can put some miles between us
Tear off that rearview mirror there's nothing left to see here
Let me lean on that gas
Oh she catches up fast
So give me

I heard it through the grapevine
My new neighbor
Don't like my big red barn
A '47 Ford
Bullet holes in the door
Broke down motor in the front yard, ha ha

I got half a mind to paint a plywood sign
And nail it up on a knotty pine tree
Saying I was here first
This is my piece of dirt
And your rambling don't rattle me

Some people care about

Worry 'bout what they say
Let a little gossip
Comin' from a loose lip
Ruin a perfect day

I wear what I want to
Overalls, work boots
Crank my music up loud
Like to sling a little mud
In my four wheel drive
Trek it all into town

Shoot a little eight ball
Down at the pool hall
Drink a beer with my friends (drink a beer with my friends)
Now don't judge me
And I won't judge you
Cause we all get judged in the end

Granddaddy was Irish Cherokee
Ran moonshine from here to Tennessee
Spent half his life in the Montgomery county jail
Grandma, she got drunk and left
All her kids on her mamas front steps
Nobody's heard from her since she hightailed

I come from a long line of losers
Half outlaw, half boozers
I was born with a shot glass in my hand
I'm part hippie, a little redneck
I'm always a suspect
My blood line made me who I am

Daddy never finished school
But he shot one mean game of pool
Took a bullet for stealin' cars down in Birmingham
Mama always went to church
But we soon found out what her reasons were
She got caught at the local motel with the preacher man

A young kid stepped in from the cold
And he ordered up a drink
He said don't look surprised old man I'm older than you think
If I was the talkin' kind I could tell you a thing or two
And since you didn't ask, let me show you my tattoos
He said I got this rose in Memphis in some back old alley dump
Picked this eagle up in Dallas, man I sure was good and drunk
And you know the way I see it, if it gets any worse out there
A guy like me hasn't got a prayer
The old man poured some coffee
He said this one's on me
Sat down his cigarette and rolled up his sleeve
Said take a good look here my friend
You see what these are
Just my ragged old and jagged ordinary scars
He said I got this one in Paris in a war 'fore you were born
And this one when I was half your age workin' on my daddy's farm
And you know the way I see it, son you ain't seen what I've seen
Cause tattoos and scars are different things
He said I've been here for all these years
And what I know is this
If you look and listen close
A man will show you what he is
You know the way I see it, you've been 'round but you're still green
Cause tattoos and scars are different things

Never meanin' no harm

Straigh'nin' the curve
Flat'nin' the hills
Someday the mountains might get 'em
But the law never will

Makin' their way
The only way they know how
That's just a little bit more
Than the law will allow

Cane poles hanging out of a four door window
Bucket full of minnows in the front floorboard
Box full of greasy cold fried chicken livers
A day on the river's what I live for

Got the radio playing and my boat while I float
Take a toke and I listen to Merle
Hot sun, cold one, I'll be a son of a gun
I'm king of the world

They grow big gators in South Louisiana
My neighbors in the swamp take an evening nap
Shoo fly, shoo fly, Polk salad Annie
Listen to the bull frogs hip-hop rap

I got a pretty thing waiting downtown
I'm in love with a green eyed girl
I'm gonna catch me a fish, go home, get a kiss
Why yes I'm king of the world

Got a stringer full of bass and a hookie in my finger
Sun burnt face and a Tylenol buzz
Take the good with the bad and the bad with the better
The weather isn't bad so better not cuss
I got a roof over me and enough to eat
And a Labrador I call Earl
He lays by my feet, looks up at me
Like I'm the king of the world

My old man's backhand used to land
Hard on the side of my head
I just learned to stay out of his way
There been street fights, blue lights, long nights
With the world sittin' on my chest
It just showed me how much I can take
Hard times, bad luck
Sometimes life sucks
That's alright
I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop lovin' me
The bank man, the bossman, the law man
All tryin' to get their hands on me
And I ain't even done a damn thing wrong
I've been way-laid, freight trained, short changed
By bigger and badder men
And all I've got to say is "bring it on"
Hard rain, rough roads, so my life goes
That's alright
I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop loving me

Gotta have you
In my life, by my side
Every day I'm alive
Every night that I'm breathin'

You work all day in the muck and the mire
Dance a little jig and a stomp by the fire
Ain't too much these boots can't do
Might even kick a little sense into you
Well I'm going up cripple creek going in a run
Going up cripple creek to have a little fun
Law man said they found some tracks
People saw them leavin but they never come back
Oh, you don't know me, you don't know, you don't know you don't know
Till you walk a while, a country mile
In my hillbilly shoes
In my hillbilly shoes

Pulled in the driveway, picked up the paper
Found my key and unlocked the door
I walked in, felt like a stranger like I'd never been there before
As I wandered room to room, it was silent as a tomb
Could've heard a teardrop, could've heard a heartbreak
Never saw the flood come even though I felt the rain
Never heard a house sound so loud with memories
Where there used to be a happy home
In the house on the corner of lonely and gone
If she talked about leaving I wasn't listening
If she showed me a sign, well, I never saw
Did she stop believing? Did I stop giving?
Can't put my finger on, what went wrong
Now the quietest noise I'm told is the sound of letting go
Could've heard a teardrop, could've heard a heartbreak
Never saw the flood come even though I felt the rain
Never heard a house sound so loud with memories
Where there used to be a happy home
In the house on the corner of lonely and gone
Whoa, never heard a house sound so loud with memories
Where there used to be a happy home in the house on the corner
In the house on the corner of lonely and goneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
***
His old man was a rebel yeller
Bad boy to the bone
He'd say, "Can't trust that other feller"
He'd judge 'em by the tone of their skin

He was raised to think like his Dad
Narrow mind, full of hate
On the road to nowhere fast
Till the Grace of God got in the way

Then he saw the light and hit his knees
And cried and said a prayer
Rose up a brand new man
Left the old one right there

Here's to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope
Some people change
Against all odds
Against the grain
Love finds a way
Some people change
She was born with her mother's habit
You could say it's in her blood
She hates that she's gotta have it
As she fills her glass up

She'd love to kill that bottle
But all she can think about
Is a better life, a second chance
And everyone she's letting down
She throws that bottle down

Here's to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope
Some people change
Against all odds
Against the grain
Love finds a way
Some people change

Thank God for those who make it
Let them be the light
(Let them be the light)
(Some people change)
Here's to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope
Some people change
(Some people change)
Against all odds
Against the grain
Love finds a way
Some people change
