Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed

Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless, aching need
I say love it is a flower
And you its only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance

It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live

And the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the Spring becomes the RoseEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

How do I get through one night without you?
If I had to live without you
What kind of life would that be?

Oh, I, I need you in my arms, need you to hold
You're my world, my heart, my soul and if you ever leave
Baby, you would take away everything good in my life
And tell me now

How do I live without you? I want to know
How do I breathe without you if you ever go?
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?

Without you, there'd be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There'd be no world left for me

And I, baby, I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you, if you ever leave
Baby, you would take away everything real in my life
And tell me now
How do I live without you? I want to know
How do I breathe without you if you ever go?
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?

Please, tell me, baby
How do I go on if you ever leave?
Baby, you would take away everything, I need you with me
Baby, don't you know that you're everything good in my life?
And tell me now

How do I live without you? I want to know
How do I breathe without you if you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?
How do I live without you?
How do I live without you, baby?
How do I live?11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Under a lovers' sky
Gonna be with you
And no one's gonna be around
If you think that you won't fall
Well, just wait until
'Til the sun goes down

Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling, so right
It will steal your heart tonight

You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it
It's gonna get to your heart

There's no escaping love
Once a gentle breeze
Weaves its spell upon your heart
No matter what you think
It won't be too long (not too long)
'Til you're in my arms
Underneath the starlight, starlight
We'll be lost in the rhythm, so right
Feel it steal your heart tonight

You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you can't
Can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it
No, matter what you do (no matter what you do)
The night is gonna get to you

(Never know
Cannot know)
Don't try, you're never gonna win

Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling, so right
It will steal your heart tonight
You can try
(You can try to resist, try to hide from my kiss but you know)
But you know that you (you know that you)
Can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark (deep in the dark)
You'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight, no, you can't fight it
(You can try) You can try to resist my kiss
But you know, don't you know that you can't?
Can't fight the moonlight deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart (surrender your heart)
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it
It's gonna get to your heart11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I don't need a lot of things
I can get by with nothing
But all the blessings life can bring
I've always needed something
But I've got all I want when it comes to loving you
You're my only reason

You're the hope that moves me
To courage again, oh yeah
You're the love that rescues me
When the cold winds rage
And it's so amazing

I don't know about tomorrow
I just live from day to day
And I don't borrow from the sunshine
'Cause the skies might turn to grey
And I don't worry about the future
'Cause I know what Jesus said
And today I'm gonna walk right beside him
'Cause he's the one who knows what is ahead

There are things about tomorrow
That I don't seem to understand
But I know who holds tomorrow
And I know who holds my hand

And each step is getting brighter
As the golden stairs I climb
And every burden is getting lighter
And all the clouds, they're silver lined
And, I'll bet the sun it's always shining
There no tears will ever dim the eye
And the ending of the rainbow
Where the mountains, they touch the sky
There are many things about tomorrow
I don't seem to understand

Oh, say can you see
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars
Through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched
Were so gallantly streaming
And the rocket's red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
Oh, say does that star spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the braveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Time, sometimes the time just slips away
And your left with yesterday
Left with the memories
I, I'll always think of you and smile
And be happy for the time
I had you with me

Though we go our separate ways
I won't forget, so don't forget
The memories we've made

Please remember, please remember
I was there for you
And you were there for me
Please remember, our time together
The time was yours and mine
And we were wild and free
Please remember, please remember me

Goodbye, there's just no sadder word to say
And it's sad to walk away
With just the memories
Who's to know what might have been?
We'll leave behind a life and time
We'll never know again

Please remember, please remember
I was there for you
And you were there for me
And remember, please remember me


Please remember, please remember
I was there for you
And you were there for me
Please remember, our time together
The time was yours and mine
And we were wild and free
Then remember, please remember me

And how we laughed and how we smiled
And how this world was yours and mine
And how no dream was out of reach
I stood by you, you stood by me
We took each day and made it shine
We wrote our names across the sky
We ran so fast, we ran so free
I had you and you had me

When we can sing with our enemies
Then we will know that times are changing
Won't we?

You know I want the best for you
As you've always wanted for me
And though our eyes may look alike but
They don't see the same thing
Hurt made a great divide
I added to the pain
My way to survive was shutting you out
Oh I was just a child, I no longer recognize
And now I'm seeing you
Maybe the first time

Mother
You did the best you could, the best you can
I know you did the best you could, the best you can
Do you know you did the best you could, the best you can?
Forgive me now, oh I understand

They say we turn into our parents
I guess we know now what they mean
We might be made of broken pieces
But that's not who we have to be
Your mother's mother taught her only how to love
From an empty fearful broken place
Oh, you were just child taught to shoulder the blame
But you're a woman now
You can lift your face
'Cause mother
You did the best you could, the best you can
I know you did the best you could, the best you can
Do you know you did the best you could, the best you can?

Hope your cares are free
And you're right where you heart longs to be
You know that
All these moments are
Like falling stars
You blink they fade into the dark
So hold on tight to Christmas Eve
And we go trust in time
Next year our worlds will realign
Will dance and drink and sing of memories
And for all the lucky ones
Who leave no "I Love You" undone
They'll see a hundred trips around the sun
And know all that their dreams become
Oh, it's Christmas Eve
I may be naive
But you're right where I hoped you would be
Here with me

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
T'was blind, but now I see

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear

Stillness filled the Heavens, on crucifixion day
Some say it rained, I don't know if it's true
Well, I can just imagine ten thousand angels crying
That would seem like rain to me and you

The angels all stood ready to take Him from the tree
They waited for the words from His voice
And when he asked the father why has thou forsaken me
They watched the savior die of his own choice

I've never seen ten thousand angels cry
But I'm sure they did
As they stood by
And watched the savior die

God turned his head away
He couldn't bear the sight
It must have looked like rain
When ten thousand angels cried
As the sun slipped away
The skies turned to grey
And when Jesus gave his all
That's when the tears began to fall
I've never seen ten thousand angels cry
But I'm sure they did
As they stood by
And watched the savior die
God turned his head away
He couldn't bear the sight
It must have looked like rain
When ten thousand angels cried

Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dreams

Alone in the dark

You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song
Rolling at sea
Adrift on the waters
Could it be finally
I'm turning for home
Finally a chance to say, "hey, I love you"
Never again to be all alone
And you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song
