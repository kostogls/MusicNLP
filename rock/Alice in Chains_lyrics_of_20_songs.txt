We chase misprinted lies
We face the path of time
And yet I fight, and yet I fight this battle all alone
No one to cry to, no place to call home

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

My gift of self is raped
My privacy is raked
And yet I find, and yet I find repeating in my head
If I can't be my own, I'd feel better dead

Ooh, ooh

Know me, broken by my master
Teach thee on child, of love hereafter

Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way

Drifting body, its sole desertion
Flying, not yet quite the notion

Ain't found a way to kill me yet
Eyes burn with stingin' sweat
Seems every path leads me to nowhere
Wife and kids, household pet
Army green was no safe bet
The bullets scream to me from somewhere

Got my pills 'gainst mosquito death

Bury me softly in this womb
I give this part of me for you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding rare flowers in a tomb, in bloom

Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved
See my heart, I decorate it like a grave
You don't understand who they thought I was supposed to be
Look at me now, a man who won't let himself be

Down in a hole, feelin' so small
Down in a hole, losin' my soul
I'd like to fly but my wings have been so denied

Down in a hole and they've put all the stones in their place
I've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste
I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth
I will speak no more of my feelings beneath

Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, losin' my soul
I'd like to fly but my wings have been so denied
Bury me softly in this womb
Oh, I wanna be inside of you
I give this part of me for you
Oh, I wanna be inside of you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Oh, I wanna be inside of you
Holding rare flowers in a tomb, in bloom
Oh, I wanna be inside

Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, losin' my soul
Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, out of control
I'd like to fly but my wings have been so denied34EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's alright, there comes a time
Got no patience to search for peace of mind
Layin' low, wanna take it slow
No more hidin' or disguisin' truths I've sold

Every day it's somethin'
Hits me all so cold
You find me sittin' by myself
No excuses, then I know

It's okay, had a bad day
Hands are bruised from breakin' rocks all day
Drained and blue, I bleed for you
You think it's funny, well, you're drownin' in it, too

Every day it's somethin'
Hits me all so cold
You find me sittin' by myself
No excuses, then I know

Yeah, it's fine, we'll walk down the line
Leave our rain and cold, trade for warm sunshine
You, my friend, I will defend
And if we change, well, I'll love you anyway

Empty fossil of the new scene

Angry walls that steal the air
Stomach hurts and I don't care

Candles red, I have a pair
Shadows dancing everywhere
Burning on the angry chair

You insult me in my home, you're forgiven this time
Things go well, your eyes dilate, you shake and "I'm high"
Look in my eyes deep and watch the clouds change with time
Twenty hours won't print my picture milk carton size
Carton size, carton size, carton size

Call me up, congratulations ain't the real why
There's no pressure besides brilliance let's say by day nine
Endless corporate ignorance lets me control time
"By the way", "by the way", "by the way", "by the way"

Once again, you see an in
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid, you kindly gurgle
Out a date for me

Now the body of one soul I adore wants to die
You have always told me you'd not live past twenty-five
I say stay long enough to repay all who caused strife
Once again, you see an in
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid, you kindly gurgle
Out a date for me
Once again, you see an in
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid, you kindly gurgle
Out a date for me

I bear true and an existing witness
To this barrel of monkeys
A self-proclaimed immoral success
Perfected by each whereof
Individually deadly, and equally so
And spread about the surrendered troops
For even thousands of miles
Will not tear apart their communication
Or the lack thereof
Vultures, liars, thieves, each proclaim their innocence
In no suggestion or rhyme
Your weapon is contained
In the wrecking of the keeping the desired effect
The breaking of the spirit thwarts the whole being
Your weapon is guilt
Your weapon is guilt
Your weapon is guilt

I have never felt such frustration
Or lack of self-control
I want you to kill me and dig me under
I wanna live no more

One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
For me

I want to taste dirty, a stinging pistol
In my mouth, on my tongue
I want you to scrape me from the walls
And go crazy like you've made me

One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me

You have the talent to make me feel like dirt
And you, you use your talent to dig me under
And cover me with dirt

What she slipping inside, slow castration
I'm a riddle so strong, you can't break me
Did she come here to try, try to take me?

Did she call my name?
I think it's gonna rain
Oh, when I die

Was it something I said, held against me?
Ain't no life on the run, slowly climbing
Caught in ice so she stares, stares at nothing
I can help her but won't, now she hates me

Did she call my name?
I think it's gonna rain
Oh, when I die

She won't let me hide
She don't want me to cry
Will she keep on the ground, trying to ground me?
Slowly forgive my lie, lying to save me
Could she love me again, or will she hate me?
Probably not, I know why, can't explain me

What does friend mean to you?
A word so wrongfully abused
Are you like me, confused?
All included but you
Alone

The sounds of silence often soothe
Shapes and colors shift with mood
Pupils widen, change their hue
Rapid brown avoid clear blue

Why's it have to be this way?
Be this way, be this way
Be this way, be this way
Be this way

Flowers watched through wide eyes bloom
A child sings an unclaimed tune
Innocence spins cold cocoon
Grow to see the pain too soon

Why's it have to be this way?
Be this way, be this way
Be this way, be this way

Next week I'll be 28

It comes this way (it comes this way)

Brother, try and hope to find

You were always so far away
I know that pain, so don't you run away

Roses in a vase of white
Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves
That fall because my hand is
Pulling them hard as I can

You were always so far away
I know that pain, I won't run away

Pictures in a box at home
Yellowing and green with mold
So I can barely see your face
Wonder how that color taste
You were always so far away
