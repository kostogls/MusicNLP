Had to have high, high hopes for a living

Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision

Mama said, it's uphill for oddities
The stranger crusaders, ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything (High, high hopes)
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down

Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me-eh-eh-eh
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh

Oh, well, imagine
As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor
And I can't help but to hear
No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words
"What a beautiful wedding!
What a beautiful wedding!”, says a bridesmaid to a waiter
"And yes, but what a shame, what a shame
The poor groom's bride is a whore"

I chimed in with a, "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chimed in, "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of

Oh, well, in fact
Well, I'll look at it this way
I mean, technically our marriage is saved
Well, this calls for a toast, so pour the champagne

Do I look lonely? I see the shadows on my face
People have told me I don't look the same
Maybe I lost weight, I'm playing hooky with the best of the best
Pull my heart out my chest, so that you can see it too

I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tangles my neck, how do I live?

The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo, how could I ask for more?
Lifetime of laughter, at the expense of the death of a bachelor

I'm cutting my mind off, feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two, and I just wanna be served
And when you think of me, am I the best you've ever had?
Share one more drink with me, smile even though you're sad

I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tangles my neck, how do I live?
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall

Locked away in permanent slumber
Assembling their philosophies
From pieces of broken memories

If you love me, let me go (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
If you love me, let me go (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)

Cold open


Been trav'lin' in packs that I can't carry anymore
Been waitin' for somebody else to carry me
There's nothin' that's there for me at my door
All the people I know aren't who they used to be
And if I try to change my life one more day
There would be nobody else to save
And I can't change into a person I don't wanna be, so

Swear to God, I ain't ever gonna repent

And every mornin' when I wake up
I wanna be who I couldn't say I'd ever been
But it's so much more than I ever was
If every night I go to sleep knowin'
That I gave everything that I, I had to give
Then it's all I could've asked for
I've been standing up beside everything I've ever said, but

Double bubble disco queen headed to the guillotine
Skin as cool as Steve McQueen, let me be your killer king
It hurts until it stops, we will love until it's not
I'm a killing spree in white, eyes like broken Christmas lights

My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss
I know you need it, do you feel it?
Drink the water, drink the wine

Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed-up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the Fourth of July
Until we feel alright
Until we feel alright
I'm like a scarf trick, it's all up the sleeve
I taste like magic, waves that swallow quick and deep
Throw the bait, catch the shark, bleed the water red
Fifty words for murder and I'm every one of them

My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss

Who are these people?
I just woke up in my underwear
No liquor left on the shelf
I should prob'ly introduce myself
You shoulda' seen what I wore
I had a cane and a party hat
I was the king of this hologram
Where there's no such thing as getting out of hand
Memories tend to just pop up
Drunk pre-meds and some rubber gloves
Five thousand people with designer drugs
Don't think I'll ever get enough
(Don't think I'll ever get enough)

Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise Hell and turn it up
Saying "If you go on, you might pass out in a drain pipe"
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

What are these footprints?
They don't look very human-like
Now I wish that I could find my clothes
Bedsheets and a morning rose
I wanna wake up
Can't even tell if this is a dream
How did we end up in my neighbor's pool
Upside-down with a perfect view?
Bar to bar at the speed of sound
Fancy feet dancing through this town
Lost my mind in a wedding gown
Don't think I'll ever get it now

Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

I'm a scholar and a gentleman
And I usually don't fall when I try to stand
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt
But I make these high heels work
I've told you time and time again
I'm not as think as you drunk I am
And we all fell down when the sun came up
I think we've had enough

Broadway is black like a sinkhole
Everyone raced to the suburbs
And I'm on the rooftop with curious strangers
This is the oddest of summers
Maybe I'll medicate, maybe inebriate
Strange situations, I get anxious
Maybe I'll smile a bit, maybe the opposite
But pray that they don't call me thankless

My Tell-Tale Heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk tie tourniquet

This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

Oscars and Emmys and Grammys
Everyone here is a trophy
And I'm sipping bourbon
The future's uncertain
The past on the pavement below me
Maybe I'll elevate, maybe I'm second rate
So unaware of my status
Maybe I'm overjoyed, maybe I'm paranoid
Designer me up in straight jackets
My Tell-Tale Heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk tie tourniquet

This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home

Hallucinations only mean that your brain is on fire
If it's Lord of the Flies in my mind tonight
I don't know if I will survive
Lighters up if you're feeling me
Fade to black if you're not mine
'Cause I just need a sign or a signal inside

This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me a, roll me a blunt
This is my roaring, roaring 20s

Heaven knows that I'm born too late
For these ghosts that I chase
With these dreams, I inflate, painted skies in my brain
Every day, I'm Carl Sagan in space
To escape this old world, this old world
Some days I lie wide awake 'til the sun hits my face
And I fade, elevate from the Earth
Far away to a place where I'm free from the weight
This old world, this old world

I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
And I don't feel anything
At all

I'm king of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

Some only live to die, I'm alive to fly higher
Than angels in outfields inside of my mind
I'm ascendin' these ladders, I'm climbin', say goodbye
This old world, this old world
And when I fall to rise with stardust in my eyes
In the backbone of night, I'm combustible
Dust in the fire when I can't sleep a wink, I'm too tired
This old world, this old world
I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
I don't feel anything
At all

I'm king of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

Stars are on the ground, you start to believe it

And nobody owes you now, when you're dying in LA
When you're dying in LA, when you're dying in LA
The power, the power, the power
Oh, the power, the power, the power
Of LA

Nights at the chateau, trapped in your sunset bungalow
You couldn't escape it, yeah
Drink of paradise, they told you, put your blood on ice
You're not gonna make it
Every face along the boulevard
Is a dreamer just like you
You looked at death in a tarot card
And you saw what you had to do

But nobody knows you now, when you're dying in LA
And nobody owes you now, when you're dying in LA
When you're dying in LA, when you're dying in LA
The power, the power, the power
Oh, the power, the power, the power
Of LA46EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Climbing out the back door, didn't leave a mark
No one knows it's you, Miss Jackson
Found another victim
But no one's gonna find Miss Jackson, Jackson, Jackson

You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now
You move in circles, hoping no one's gonna find out
But we're so lucky, kiss the ring and let 'em bow down
Looking for the time of your life (No one's gonna find out)
A pretty picture, but the scenery is so loud
A face like Heaven, catching lighting in your nightgown
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown
The party isn't over tonight (In your nightgown)

Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway
I love her anyway, I love her anyway
Out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway

Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Are you nasty? I love her anyway
Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anywy

Way down till the fire finally dies out
You've got 'em wrapped around your finger, watch 'em fall down
There's something beautiful and tragic in the fallout
Let me say it one more time (Tragic in the fallout)

Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway
I love her anyway, I love her anyway
Out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway

Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Are you nasty? I love her anyway

Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her any—
Climbing out the back door, didn't leave a mark
No one knows it's you, Miss Jackson
Found another victim
But no one's going to find Miss Jackson, Jackson, Jackson
I love her anyway

Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, are you nasty?
Are you nasty? I love her anyway

Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway54EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's these substandard motels on the la-la-la-la-la
Corner of 4th and Fremont Street
Appealing only 'cause they're just that unappealing
Any practiced Catholic would cross themselves upon entering
The rooms have a hint of asbestos and maybe
Just a dash of formaldehyde
And a habit of decomposing
Right before your very la-la-la-la eyes

Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

Tonight's tenants range from a lawyer and a virgin
Accessorizing with a rosary tucked inside her lingerie
She's getting a job at the firm come Monday
The Mrs. will stay with the cheating attorney
Moonlighting aside, she really needs his money
A wonderful caricature of intimacy
Yeah, yeah

And not to mention the constable
And his proposition for that “virgin”
Yes, the one the lawyer met with
On "strictly business", as he said to the Mrs
Well, only hours before, after he had left
She was fixing her face in a compact
There was a terrible crash
There was a terrible crash
Between her and the badge
She spilled her purse and her bag
And held a purse of a different kind
Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

There are no
Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things
Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things

Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy


Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things

Kids, you have to remember I'm up here conducting you for a reason, okay? Watch me, watch my fingers. Here we go, ready? Watch me. One and, two and, three and, ready, go!

Dès le premier jour, ton parfum enivra mon amour
Et dans ces instants, j'aimerais être comme toi par moments
Mais depuis ce jour, je n'ai qu'un seul et unique regret...

My wing tips waltz across naive wood floors
They creak innocently down the stairs
Drag melody, my percussive
Feet serve cobweb headaches as a

Matching set of marching clocks
The slumbering apparitions that they've come to wake up

Here I am composing a burlesque
Out of where they rest their necks
Sunken in their splintered cradles
And ramshackle heads, they asked for it
As a girl

You have set your heart on haunting me forever from the start
It's never silent
Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And that one regret is you

How does a heart love if no one has noticed
Its presence, and where does it go?
Trembling hands play my heart like a drum
But the beat's gotten lost in the show

You have set your heart on haunting me forever from the start
It's never silent

Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And I regret never letting you go!
Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume
It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do
Ever since we met, I've got just one regret to live through
And that one regret is you!
Mona Lisa, pleased to please ya... (And that one regret is you!)
Mona Lisa, pleased to please ya... (And that one regret is you!)
Mona Lisa, pleased to please ya... (I've got just one...)
Ahhh...29EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She paints her fingers with a close precision
He starts to notice empty bottles of gin
And takes a moment to assess the sin she's paid for
A lonely speaker in a conversation
Her words are swimming through his ears again
There's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you paid for

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

He senses something, call it desperation
Another dollar, another day
And if she had the proper words to say, she would tell him
But she'd have nothing left to sell him

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

Mona Lisa, wear me out
I'm pleased to please ya
Mona Lisa, wear me out

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I wanna believe
There's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you paid for55EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If all our life is but a dream, fantastic posing greed
Then we should feed our jewelry to the sea
For diamonds do appear to be
Just like broken glass to me
And then she said she can't believe
Genius only comes along in storms of fabled foreign tongues
Tripping eyes and flooded lungs
Northern downpour sends its love

Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely

The ink is running toward the page, it's chasing off the days
Look back at boat feet and that winding knee
I missed your skin when you were east
You clicked your heels and wished for me
Through playful lips made of yarn, that fragile Capricorn
Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
I know the world's a broken bone
But melt your headaches, call it home
Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely

Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely
Sugarcane in the easy morning (Hey moon, hey moon...)
Weathervanes my one and lonely (Hey moon, hey moon...)
Sugarcane in the easy morning (Hey moon, hey moon...)
Weathervanes my one and lonely (Hey moon, hey moon...)

Sugarcane in the easy morning
(Hey moon, please forget to fall down)
Weathervanes my one and lonely
(Hey moon, don't you go down)
Sugarcane in the easy morning
(You are at the top of my lungs)
Weathervanes my one and lonely
(Drawn to the ones who never yawn)
(Sugarcane in the easy morning)
Hey moon, please forget to fall down

Hey moon, don't you go down
You are at the top of my lungs
