OOOOOWW!!

Well is it true what they say about it?
They say it's new but I have to doubt it
And then they tell you everything about it
Had enough
I got some people saying this way
I got some people saying that way
I got some people saying there's no way
Ain't it tough

See the idiot walk
See the idiot talk
See the idiot chalk up his name on the blackboard
See the robot walk
See the robot talk
See the robot write up his name on the ballot

They say, "this is all I need to get by"
The truth is, baby, it's a lie

Well, is it true what they say about it?
You oughta do what I do and doubt it
He won and now he's gonna do something about it
Ain't it sad?
And if you don't wanna feel like a putz
Collect the clues and connect the dots
You'll see the pattern that is bursting your bubble
And it's bad
See the idiot walk
See the idiot talk
See the idiot chalk up his name on the blackboard

They say, "this is all i need to get by"
The truth is, baby, it's a lie
Its a
Its a lie-ie-ie-ie-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

This is what it boils down to

If you review the winning combination
Body at work and a mind on vacation
Who had the brain where it started to sink in?
It was you

You've seen the idiot walk
See the idiot talk
But you never learned nothing and nothing isn't over
See the robot walk
See the robot talk
Still you never learned nothing and nothing isn't over
They say, "this is all I need to get by"
The truth is baby it's a lie1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm on my way
Can't settle down
Stuck in ways of being an ass
And I got a lotta nerve that I'm ready to pass
I'm on my way
Can't settle down
Stuck in ways of sadistic joy
My talent only goes as far as to annoy, I'm on my way

This is my main offender
This is what I've got and it got me saying
Why me?

I'm on my way
I get around
Not all too sure about what I do
I feel I've got to stop a second just to think it through
And so I stop

I'm on my way
Yeah, I get around
Thought it all over and now I spit it out

So did you miss me boys and girls?
I crawled out of the underworld

Dead and gone

Through the thick of the woods and the shimmering glare
The moon up above lights up the air
What the blood red moon brings it should come as no surprise
To a place with a meaning only few understand
The gathering six holding each other's hands
The willow it sings as to offer its advice

One can't stand without the other
And either will not run
The war can't be avoided but it can be won
Another blood red moon
The blood red moon
Another blood red moon
The blood red moon
Another blood red moon

I can sit and watch bad history unfold
I control my own destiny I break up the mold
So what if I'm a witch shouldn't come as a surprise
Through the valley of fear I walk each day
But a circle of six now shows me the way
And now I climb mountains wherever they may rise
But I can't stand without you others
And you are nothing without me
We've been ready all our lives to set the power free
Another blood red moon
The blood red moon
Another blood red moon
The blood red moon
Ooh another blood red moon

But I can't stand without you others
And you are nothing without me
We've been ready all our lives to set the power free
Another blood red moon

So you look for authenticity
But I can see what is bothering me
The kind you want from long way back in time
It's been disposable since '79

I never wanted this to end
Good with transmission but too lazy to send
Not going down no in no history
You're going down because of me

A lot of cause to be alarmed
A solid chance of an incoming harm
Put up with me or I put you away
So I ask what have we learned here today

I never wanted it to stop
So I gave notice and I moved to the top
Your opinion never weighed a ton
And your talking never hurt anyone

And now it's time to see
What you get from me
But full understanding can't be guaranteed
You say we had our fill
But I move for the kill
I keep on doing it till I get everybody everywhere
People are people and they're never scared away
I say
Ten dead but no pun!
So you look for authenticity
Only to find what you wanted in me
You had a function long long time ago
Had a function but the thinking was slow

I never wanted this to end
Good with transmission but too lazy to send
Not going down no in no history
You're going down because of meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You were the whisper in the wind
You hear that I come back again
Thought I was dead and gone but my light's still on, and...
My time is coming
You see, I grew up in a hole
Squeezing diamonds out of coals
I'm the seventh son
I'm the only one, and I'm...
On the rise
I'm electricity starting to hum
I'm burning brighter than the morning sun
When people try
To do as I
I say, "Let them try!"
Praise the lord, my time is coming
I cut a swath through the Poconos
And I paid my dues in the barrios
I have a plan
And they say I can't
But, yes, I can
No more waiting on the sidelines
And no more hanging on the thin line
Got my leather on
And my problems are gone, and
My time is coming
Praise the lord, my time is coming
Praise the lord, my time is coming
So people of the world
You take a bow
Cause I used to be out
But I'm flaming now
So hold on tight
With your knuckles white, cause
My time is coming
Praise the lord, my time is coming
Praise the lord, my time is...
Praise the lord, my time is...
Praise the lord, my time is...

You'll never get it right
They got a hundred lies for you
And when they pass them out
You got to give or take a few
And be just the same
A head in the crowd but behind the game
Oh well, you never can tell

You're such a clever kid
But I see what's wrong with you
It's all you ever did
Take lies and believe them true
Knew it all along
Another act and a truth gone wrong
Oh no, it ain't my Hollywood

I went on strike when the union said "I would"
Had a sign in my hand 'cause the times were no good
All this time all they ever told me to
Was get a little lie to ring a little true
I went on strike when the union said "I would"
Had a sign in my hand 'cause the times were no good
All this time all they ever told me to
Was to get a little more for your little you
And maybe you're alright
And maybe I don't have a clue
Yeah, maybe black is white
And maybe black is white too
But it's all the same
You don't get the picture, you're getting framed
You took the bait and now it's too late

You didn't turn out right
Just look at you
You had the biggest plans
But no way to carry through
It was all an act
And now you can't stick to the facts
Oh no, but it ain't my Hollywood

I went on strike when the union said "I would"
Had a sign in my hand 'cause the times were no good
All this time all they ever told me to
Was get a little lie to ring a little true
You spent your time just like they said you should
Now those marks on your face just don't look any good

Was to get a little more for your little you

Hear them saying that a lot's a lot
You think that is all that matters?
You've done your math well
You've checked the figures
You've done your math, tell
Who is the bigger man
Can't explain it but you've got a hunch
Well, that's always something
Climb up the ladder, step up a notch
Climb up the ladder, can you see what you got?

But if you do it, do it good, Brutus
Real good, like a little man should

Did your homework and you worked the mob
Because it’s all you can do
Tried for a lot still, you have a little
Whatever happened, mister?
You couldn’t figure, out of the rut
Still you can’t get it right
Can’t get a lot for a little?
You keep trying, ended up in the middle
Had an enigma, ended up with a riddle
But if you do it, do it good, Brutus
Real good, like a little man should

Rewind and look at what you got
An ambition but you lost the plot
Judas, Brutus, Quisling, Time has come to do
What's expected of you

Real good
Like a little man shouldEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Waited far too long
For this day to dawn
Marked position with an x and kept floating on
Now I stretch and yawn
All impostors gone
Once again it’s time to reap and sow
I’m a rising tide
Rollercoaster ride
We’re ch-ch-chuggin right into the fun
I won't be denied
So you open wide
Cause I’m only looking out for you
My patrolling days are over
And I ain’t shot nobody since
I fought the big cheese out of office
And showed the hep kids how to dance
And now we’re gonna take a ride on the wiggle and sway
I got my finger on the trigger and it’s time to play
And with every little step I blow your mind away
Forever H-P-A!
What now! It’s going down!
From way up top to the down low
Take a chromosome
Make it monochrome
And I’ll tell you what I’m gonna do
Be a rising tide
Rollercoaster ride
We’re ch-ch-chuggin right into the fun
I won't be denied
So you open wide
Cause I’m only looking out for you
My patrolling days are over
And I ain’t shot nobody since
I fought the big cheese out of office
And showed the hep kids how to dance
And now we’re gonna take a ride on the wiggle and sway
I got my finger on the trigger and it’s time to play
And with every little step I blow your mind away
Forever H-P-A!
My patrolling days are over
And I ain’t shot nobody since
I fought the big cheese out of office
And showed the hep kids how to dance
And now we’re gonna take a ride on the wiggle and sway
I got my finger on the trigger and it’s time to play
And with every little step I blow your mind away
Forever H-P-A!
'Cause my patrolling days are over
And I ain’t shot nobody since
I fought the big cheese out of office
And showed the hep kids how to dance
And now we’re gonna take a ride on the wiggle and sway
I got my finger on the trigger and it’s time to play
And with every little step I blow your mind away
Forever H-P-A!
Cause see I rolled in through the back door when it was my turn for throne
I never wanted to stand on your pedestal man cause I was born to build my own
When they say do or die, I said no way no how, they said I wouldn’t last for long
But I’m still standing in the hurricane’s eye and it’s dancing to my song
Again I rolled in round the back door, no I ain’t got no common sense
So you can bitch and whine, but you best stand aside cause I’m doing it again
Well no I won’t unwind, I won't be dumped behind, I won't be coolly led astray
So on the dotted line, I slit my thumb and sign yours truly, HPA!
My patrolling days are over
And I ain’t shot nobody since
I fought the big cheese out of office
And showed the hep kids how to dance
And now we’re gonna take a ride on the wiggle and sway
I got my finger on the trigger and it’s time to play
And with every little step I blow your mind away
Forever H-P-A!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
