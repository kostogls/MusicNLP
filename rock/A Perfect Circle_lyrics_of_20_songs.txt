Time is money and money's time
We wasted every second dime
On diets, lawyers, shrinks and apps and flags and plastic surgery
Now Willy Wonka, Major Tom, Ali, and Leia have moved on
Signal the final curtain call in all its atomic pageantry
Bravissimo, hip hip hooray
For this fireworks display
Mind and body blown away
What a radiant crescendo
Ticker tape parade
Our hair and skin like
Marilyn Monroe
In an afterwind
Time is money and money's time
We wasted every second dime
On politicians, fancy water and guns and plastic surgery
Like our Prince and Reenie's mom
All the dolphins have moved on
Signaling the final curtain call in all its atomic pageantry
Bravissimo, hip hip hooray
What a glorious display
Melt our joyous hearts away
Under the mushroom cloud confetti
Hip hip hooray
For this fireworks display
Mind and body blown away
What a radiant crescendo
Hip hip hooray
Hip hip hooray
Ticker tape parade
Our hair and skin like
Marilyn Monroe in an afterwind
Time is money and money's time

Behold a new Christ
Behold the same old horde
Gather at the altering
New beginning, new word
And the word was death
And the word was without light
The new beatitude:
"Good luck, you're on your own"

Blessed are the fornicates
May we bend down to be their whores
Blessed are the rich
May we labor, deliver them more
Blessed are the envious
Bless the slothful, the wrathful, the vain
Blessed are the gluttonous
May they feast us to famine and war

What of the pious, the pure of heart, the peaceful?
What of the meek, the mourning, and the merciful?
All doomed
All doomed
Behold a new Christ
Behold the same old horde
Gather at the altering
New beginning, new word
And the word was death
And the word was without light
The new beatitude: "Good luck"

What of the pious, the pure of heart, the peaceful?
What of the meek, the mourning, and the merciful?
What of the righteous? What of the charitable?
What of the truthful, the dutiful, the decent?

Doomed are the poor
Doomed are the peaceful
Doomed are the meek
Doomed are the merciful
For the word is now death
And the word is now without light
The new beatitude:
"Fuck the doomed, you're on your own"10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Dopamine
On dopamine
On dopamine
On dope

We have been overrun by our animal desire
Addicts of the immediate keep us obedient and unaware
Feeding this mutation, this Pavlovian despair

We've become
Disillusioned
So we run
Towards anything glimmering

Time to put the silicon obsession down
Take a look around
Find a way in the silence
Lie supine away with your back to the ground
Dis- and re-connect to the resonance now
You were never an island
Unique
Voice among the many
In this choir
Tuning
Into each other
Lift all higher
Dopamine
On dopamine
On dopamine
On dope

Willingly been re-wired by clever agents within
Looping our reflections, our obsessions draw us in
Fix and fixation, no sentience beyond

We've become
Disillusioned
So we dive like crows
Towards anything glittering

Time to put the silicon obsession down
Take a look around
Find a way in the silence
Lie supine away with your back to the ground
Dis- and re-connect to the resonance now
You were never an island

You're such an inspiration for the ways
That I will never, ever choose to be

Oh, so many ways for me to show you
How your savior has abandoned you

Fuck your God
Your Lord, your Christ, He did this
Took all you had and left you this way
Still you pray, you never stray, you never
Never taste of the fruit
Never thought to question why

It's not like you killed someone
It's not like you drove a hateful spear into his side
Praise the one who left you broken down and paralyzed
He did it all for you
He did it all for you

Oh, so many ways for me to show you
How your dogma has abandoned you
Pray to your Christ, to your God
Never taste of the fruit
Never stray, never break never
Choke on a lie!
Even though He's the one who did this to you
Never thought to question why

Not like you killed someone
It's not like you drove a spiteful spear into his side
Talk to Jesus Christ as if He knows the reasons why
He did it all for you, oh
He did it all for you, woah
He did it all for you14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Threw you the obvious
And you flew with it on your back
A name in your recollection
Down, among a million same

Difficult not to feel a little bit
Disappointed and passed over
When I look right through
To see you naked, but oblivious
And you don't see me

But I threw you the obvious
Just to see if there's more behind
The eyes of a fallen angel
Eyes of a tragedy

Here, I am, expecting just a little bit
Too much from the wounded
But I see, see through it all
See through, see you
'Cause I threw you the obvious
To see what occurs behind
The eyes of a fallen angel
Eyes of a tragedy, oh well

Oh well, apparently nothing
Apparently nothing, at all

You don't, you don't, you don't see me
You don't, you don't, you don't see me

Help me, if you can
It's just that this is not the way I'm wired
So, could you please help me understand why
You've given in to all these reckless dark desires?

You're lying to yourself again, suicidal imbecile
Think about it, you're pounding on a fault line
What'll it take to get it through to you, precious?
I'm over this, why do you wanna throw it away like this?
Such a mess, why would I wanna watch you?

Disconnect and self-destruct
One bullet at a time
What's your rush, now?
Everyone will have his day to die

Medicated drama queen
Picture perfect, numb belligerence
Narcissistic drama queen
Craving fame and all its decadence

Lying through your teeth again, suicidal imbecile
Think about it, you're pounding on a fault line
What'll it take to get it through to you, precious?

Best to keep things in the shallow end
'Cause I never quite learned how to swim

Taken by this seamless vision
I close my eyes

Mistook the nods for an approval

Tilling my own grave to keep me level
Jam another dragon down the hole
Digging to the rhythm and the echo of a solitary siren
One that pushes me along and leaves me so

Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Over you

Someone feed the monkey while I dig in search of China White as Dracula as I approach the bottom

Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Over you

Little angel go away, come again some other day
The devil has my ear today, I'll never hear a word you say
He promised I would find a little solace and some peace of mind
Whatever just as long as I don't feel so

So glad to see you well
Overcome them, completely silent now
With Heaven's help
You've cast your demons out

And not to pull your halo down
Around your neck and tug you off your cloud
But I'm more than just a little curious
How you're planning to go about making your amends
To the dead
To the dead

Recall the deeds as if they're all
Someone else's atrocious stories
Now you stand reborn before us all
So glad to see you well

And not to pull your halo down
Around your neck and tug you to the ground
But I'm more than just a little curious
How you're planning to go about making your amends
To the dead

Damages define our border
Wall and manner forged in flame
Knowing little of your wounding
Share our mending all the same

Weight of words and wars we carry
I'm like you, just like you
Eyes of secret, storm, and story
Show and tell, we'll make it through

Sadness, like a pendulum
Pulls us 'round and to and fro
Onus, fate and undue odium
Armor, anchor, lead, and stone

By the telling, will they become?
Will they all be feathers?

Beware the Contrarian

Soul is out of tune

Metaphor for a missing moment
Pull me in to your perfect circle
One womb, one shame, one resolve
Liberate this will to release us all

Gotta cut away, clear away
Snip away and sever this

And from pulling you down with me here
I can almost hear you scream

One more medicated, peaceful moment
Give me one more medicated, peaceful moment

It's no easy mission, holding on to how I picture you
Showing only bits and pieces

Searching your eyes for a hint or trace

Pay no mind what other voices say

Safe from pain and truth and choice and other poison devils

Isolate and save you from yourself

Of the new world order and
Counting bodies like sheep

Run desire, run, sexual being
Run him like a blade to and through the heart
No conscience, one motive
To cater to the hollow

Screaming feed me, here
Fill me up again
And temporarily pacify this hungering

So grow, libido, throw
Dominoes of indiscretions down
Falling all around in cycles, in circles
Constantly consuming, conquer and devour

'Cause it's time to bring the fire down
Bridle all this indiscretion
Long enough to edify
And permanently fill this hollow

Screaming feed me, here
Fill me up again
