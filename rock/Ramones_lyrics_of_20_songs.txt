Under the arc of a weather stain boards
Ancient goblins and warlords
Come out of the ground, not making a sound
The smell of death is all around
And the night when the cold wind blows
No one cares, nobody knows

I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again

Follow Victor to the sacred place
This ain't a dream, I can't escape
Molars and fangs, the clicking of bones
Spirits moaning among the tombstones
And the night, when the moon is bright
Someone cries, something ain't right

I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
The moon is full, the air is still
All of a sudden I feel a chill
Victor is grinning, flesh rotting away
Skeletons dance, I curse this day
And the night when the wolves cry out
Listen close and you can hear me shout
I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again

Oh no, oh no
I don't want to live my life not again, oh no, oh oh
I don't want to live my life not again, oh no no no

You've got to pick up the pieces
Come on, sort your trash
Better pull yourself back together
Maybe you've got too much cash
Better call, call the law
When are you gonna turn yourself in, yeah?
You're a politician
Don't become one of Hitler's children

Bonzo goes to Bitburg then goes out for a cup of tea
As I watched it on TV somehow it really bothered me
Drank in all the bars in town to understand your foreign policy
Pick up the pieces

(Ba-na-na-na) My brain is hanging upside down
(Ba-na-na-na) I need something to slow me down
(Ba-na-na-na) My brain is hanging upside down
(Ba-na-na-na) And I need something to slow me down
Shouldn't wish you happiness
Wish her the very best
Fifty thousand dollar dress
Shaking after your highness
See through you like cellophane
You watch the world complain
But you do it anyway
Who am I if I'm to say

Bonzo goes to Bitburg then goes out for a cup of tea
As I watched it on TV somehow it really bothered me
Drank in all the bars in town to understand your foreign policy
Pick up the pieces

(Ba-na-na-na) My brain is hanging upside down
(Ba-na-na-na) I need something to slow me down
(Ba-na-na-na) My brain is hanging upside down
(Ba-na-na-na) And I need something to slow me down

If there's one thing that makes me sick
It's when someone tries to hide behind politics
I wish that time could go by fast
Somehow they manage to make it last

(Ba-na-na-na) My brain is hanging upside down

When I'm lying in my bed at night
I don't want to grow up
Nothing ever seems to turn out right
I don't want to grow up

How do you move in a world of fog that's
Always changing things
Makes me wish that I could be a dog

When I see the price that you pay
I don't want to grow up
I don't ever want to be that way
I don't want to grow up

Seems that folks turn into things
That they never want
The only thing to live for is today

I'm gonna put a hole in my T.V. set
I don't want to grow up
Open up the medicine chest
I don't want to grow up
I don't want to have to shout it out
I don't want my hair to fall out
I don't want to be filled with doubt
I don't want to be a good boy scout
I don't want to have to learn to count
I don't want to have the biggest amount
No, I don't want to grow up

Well, when I see my parents fight
I don't want to grow up
They all go out and drinking all night
And I don't want to grow up

I'd rather stay here in my room
Nothing out there but sad and gloom
I don't want to live in a big old tomb on Grand Street

When I see the 5 o'clock news
I don't want to grow up
Comb their hair and shine their shoes
I don't wanna grow up
Stay around in my old hometown
I don't want to put no money down
I don't want to get a big old loan
Work them fingers to the bone
I don't want to float on a broom
Fall in love, get married then boom
How the hell did it get here so soon
No, I don't want to grow upEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

How good it feels to hold you

And though I'm really trying
I think I may start crying
My heart can't wait another day

Kiss me I just got to
Kiss me I just got to say

Baby, I love you
Come on baby

Baby I love, I love only you

I can't live without you
I love everything about you
I can't help it if I feel this way

Well no one ever thought this one would survive
Helpless child, going to walk a drum beat behind
I lock you in a dream, I never let you go
I never let you laugh or smile, not you

Well, I just want to walk right out of this world
''Cause everybody has a poison heart
I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart

Making friends with a homeless torn up man
He just kind of smiles, it really shakes me up
There's danger on every corner but I'm okay
Walking down the street, trying to forget yesterday

Well, I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart

A poison heart
A poison heart
A poison heart, yeah
You know that life really takes its toll
And a poet's gut reaction is to search his very soul
So much their confusion before my eyes
But nothing seems to phase me, and this one still survives

I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
I just want to walk right out of this world
