So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken, shattered I lie
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot, then we can die
Oh, oh, oh
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, don't you know?
You say you don't know
I say: take me out

Don't move, time is slow
I say: take me out


Well, I say you don't know
You say you don't know

If I move, this could die
If eyes move, this could die
I want you to take me out

When you're half way from a dream
Is it hard to work out what is real?
Is the real over there
More vivid than here ever feels?
We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody to love

Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love elevation
Outside, fresh avaricide
But inside our love, you'll be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love celebration
Cop car burn, reason turn
But it'll bring you up, you'll be alright
You'll be alright

Is the Blackpool bright light
Brighter than the light in your home?
Were you born to be loved
But nobody else seems to know?
We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody to love
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love elevation
Outside, fresh avaricide
But inside our love, you'll be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love celebration
Cop car burn, reason term
But it'll bring you up, you'll be alright


We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody
We're all looking for somebody
We're all looking for (All looking for)
Somebody to love

Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love elevation
Outside, fresh avaricide
But inside our love, you'll be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love celebration
Cop car burn, reason turn
But it'll bring you up, you'll be alright

Take your white finger
Slide the nail under the top and bottom buttons of my blazer
Relax the fraying wool, slacken ties
And I'm not to look at you in the shoe
But the eyes find the eyes

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinée, the dark of the matinée
It's better in the matinée, the dark of the matinée is mine
Yes, it's mine

Time every journey to bump into you accidentally
I charm you and tell you of the boys I hate, all the girls I hate
All the words I hate, all the clothes I hate
How I'll never be anything I hate
You smile, mention something that you like
Oh, how you'd have a happy life if you did the things you like

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinée, the dark of the matinée
It's better in the matinée, the dark of the matinée is mine
Yes, it's mine
So I'm on BBC Two now
Telling Terry Wogan how I made it
And what I made is unclear now
But his deference is and his laughter is
My words and smile are so easy now
Yes, it's easy now
Yes, it's easy now

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinée, dark of the matinée
It's better in the matinée, the dark of the matinée
You will find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinée, the dark of the matinée
Better in the matinée, the dark of the matinée is mine
Yes, it's mine7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(Put your ladder down, put your ladder down
Put your ladder down, put your ladder down)
Don’t be concerned
It’s just the way that gravity works 'round here
All slowly rising, falling patiently
Feel no, feel no fear
Cirrus caress you, cumulus kiss you
Raindrops of crystal whisper, "We’ll miss you"
But go
Let go

Always and always and always ascending
The opening line leaves an uncertain ending
Always and always and always ascending
The chords seem to pause, but ahh–

Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Ah, talk to me (Talk to me)
C'mon, talk to me (Talk to me)
Yeah, talk to me (Talk to me)
Ahh, oh
Yeah, wake me up
C'mon wake me up
Waking up dry, waking up dusty
Feeling remorse, feeling thirsty
Bring me a cup, bring me water
We can ascend from this arrangement
We can see fate as entertainment
Bring me a cup, bring me water
Bring me water

Always and always and always ascending
The Shepard misleads so you think you’re transcending
Always and always and always ascending
Pause the progression, but ahh–

Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Ah, talk to me (Talk to me)

Crushed the end within my stride
Said I'm strong now I know that I'm a leaver

So they say you're troubled, boy
Just because you like to destroy
All the things that bring the idiots joy
Well, what's wrong with a little destruction?
And the Kunst won't talk to you
'Cause you kissed St Rollox adieu
'Cause you robbed a supermarket or two
Well, who gives a damn about the prophets of Tesco?

Did I see you in a limousine?
Fling out the fish and the unleavened?
Turn the rich into wine as you walk on the mean

Well, the fallen are the virtuous among us
Walk among us, never judge us
Yeah, we're all

Up now and get 'em, boy
Up now and get 'em, boy
Drink to the devil and death at the doctors

Did I see you in a limousine?
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened?
Well, five-thousand users fed today
Oh, as you feed us, won't you lead us
To be blessed?
So we stole and drank champagne
On the seventh seal, you said you never feel pain
"I never feel pain, won't you hit me again?"
"I need a bit of black and blue to be a rotation"
In my blood, I felt bubbles burst
There was a flash of fist, an eyebrow burst
You've a lazy laugh and a red white shirt
I fall to the floor, fainting at the sight of blood

Did I see you in a limousine?
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened?
You turn the rich into wine, walk on the mean
Be they Magdalene or virgin, you've already been
You've already been, and we've already seen

That the fallen are the virtuous among us
Walk among us, never judge us
To be blessed

La, la-la-la
La, la-la-la
La-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
So I'm sorry if I ever resisted
I never had a doubt you ever existed
I only have a problem when people insist on
Taking their hate, placing it on your name
Some say you're troubled, boy
Just because you like to destroy
You are the word, the word is 'destroy'
I break this bottle, think of you fondly

Did I see you in a limousine?
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened?
To the whore in a hostel and the scum of a scheme
Turn the rich into wine, walk on the mean
It's not a jag in the arm, it's a nail in the beam
On the barren Earth, you scatter your seed
Be they Magdalene or virgin, you've already been
You've already been, you've already seen
That the one who, one who, one who, one who
One who, one who, one who, one who
Yeah, you've already been, you've already seen

Eyes boring a way through me
Paralyse, controlling completely
Now there is a fire in me
A fire that burns

This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn it, I'll burn it, I, I, I'll burn it down

Eyes burning a way through me
Overwhelm, destroying so sweetly
Now there is a fire in me
A fire that burns

This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
Then I'm, I'm out of control and I burn
Oh, how I burn for you
Burn, oh, how I burn for you
Burn, how I burn
How I burn, oh, how I


This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn it, I'll burn it, I, I, I'll burn it down1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I’m a lazy boy

I’m a lazy boy, I’m a lazy boy
Never getting up in time
I enjoy being a lazy boy
Lying in your bed
Thinking of how a lazy boy loves you

Am I gonna get up? Am I gonna get up, get up? Never
Am I gonna get up? Am I gonna get up, get up? Never
Am I gonna get up? Am I gonna get up, get up? Never
Am I gonna get up? Am I gonna get up, get up? Never

I’m a lazy boy, I’m a lazy boy
Always be a lazy boy
I’m a lazy boy, yes, a lazy boy
Lazy in the evening boy
Ah, and a lazy boy loves you


Am I gonna get up? Am I gonna get up, get up? Never
Am I gonna get up? Am I gonna get up, get up? Never
Am I gonna get up? Am I gonna get up, get up? Never
Never, never, never
I’m a lazy boy, I’m a lazy boy
Always be a lazy boy
I’m a lazy boy, yes, a lazy boy
Lazy in the morning boy
I’m a lazy boy, I’m a lazy boy
Such a lazy, lazy, boy
I’m a lazy boy, yes, a lazy boy
Lazy in the evening boy
I’m a lazy boy, what a lazy boy
Yes, he is a lazy boy
Ah, and a lazy boy loves you2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

As I glance once upon the foam
Forty feet beneath my feet
The coldest calm falls through the molten veins
Cooling all the blood to slush, congeals around again

Oh-oh, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la
Oh, and forty feet remain

Salt scales upon my drying arms
Burn my back beneath the sun
But I am cold beneath the burning rays
Looking down, looking down, down, down again

Oh-oh, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la
Oh, and forty feet remain


La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Oh, and forty feet remain5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
