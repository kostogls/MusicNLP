Is it worth it? Can you even hear me?
Standing with your spotlight on me
Not enough to feed the hungry
I'm tired, and I felt it for a while now
In this sea of lonely
The taste of ink is getting old, it's
Four o' clock in the fucking morning
Each day gets more and more like the last day
Still I can see it coming
While I'm standing in the river drowning
This could be my chance to break out
This could be my chance to say goodbye
At last, it's finally over
Couldn't take this town much longer
Being half-dead wasn't what I planned to be
Now I'm ready to be free

So here I am, it's in my hands
And I'll savor every moment of this
So here I am, alive at last
And I'll savor every moment of this

Don't you think I'm pretty
When I'm standing top the bright-lit city?
And I'll take your hand and pick you up
And keep you there so you can see it
So long as you're alive and care
I promise I will take you there
We'll drink and dance the night away
We can drink and dance the night away
So here I am, it's in my hands
And I'll savor every moment of this
So here I am, alive at last
And I'll savor every moment of this, I'll savor every moment of this

As long as you're alive, here I am
I promise I will take you there
As long as you're alive, here I am
I promise I will take you there

Don't you think I'm pretty
When I'm standing top the bright-lit city?
And I'll take your hand and pick you up
And keep you there so you can see it
As long as you're alive and care
I promise I will take you there
So long as you're alive and care
I promise I will take you there

So here I am, it's in my hands
And I'll savor every moment of this
So here I am, alive at last, and I'll savor every moment of this
Savor every moment of this, savor every moment of this!

So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me
Off guard, red handed, now I'm far from lonely
Asleep, I still see you lying next to me
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me, ahh

I need something else, would someone please just give me
Hit me, and knock me out and let me go back to sleep?
I can't laugh all I want, inside I still am empty
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me, ahh

I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

I guess I remember every glance you shot me
Unharmed, I'm losing weight and some body-heat
I squoze so hard, I stopped your heart from beating
So deep that I didn't even scream, fuck me, ahh
I'll be just fine

And it's all in how you mix the two
And it starts just where the light exists

It's a feeling that you cannot miss
It burns a hole
Through everyone that feels it

Well, you're never gonna find it
If you're looking for it
Won't come your way, yeah
Well, you'll never find it
If you're looking for it

Should've done something, but I've done it enough
By the way your hands were shaking
Rather waste some time with you

And you never would have thought, in the end
How amazing it feels just to live again

It's a feeling that you cannot miss
And it burns a hole
Through everyone that feels it
Well, you're never gonna find it
If you're looking for it

Small, simple, safe price
Rise the wake and carry me with all of my regrets
This is not a small cut that scabs, and dries, and flakes, and heals
And I am not afraid to die
I'm not afraid to bleed and fuck and fight
I want the pain of payment
What's left, but a section of pygmy-size cuts
Much like a slew of a thousand unwanted fucks
Would you be my little cut?
Would you be my thousand fucks?
And make mark leaving space for the guilt to be liquid
To fill and spill over and under my thoughts
My sad, sorry, selfish cry out to the cutter
I'm cutting trying to picture your black, broken heart
Love is not like anything
Especially a fucking knife

Look at me, you can tell
By the way I move and do my hair
Do you think that it's me or it's not me?
I don't even care
I'm alive, I don't smell
I'm the cleanest I have ever been
I feel big, I feel tall, I feel dry
Dry
Just look at me, look at me now
I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake
Just look at me, look at me now
I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake

Do I drink? Do I date?
I've got perfect placement
All my ink satisfied in your eyes
I'm the biggest fan I've got right now
I made sure that I look how I wanted to look
The people around me
The people surround me
I feel big, I feel tall, I feel dry
Dry

Just look at me, look at me now
I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake
Just look at me, look at me now
I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake
Just look at me, look at me now
I'm a fake, I'm a fake
Just look at me, look at me now
I'm a fake, I'm a fake
My stomach hurts now
And all tied off in lace
I pray, I beg for anything
To hit me in the face
And this sickness isn't me
And I pray to fall from grace
The last thing I see is feeling
And I'm telling you I'm a fake
I'm telling you I'm...

Just look at me, look at me now
I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake, I'm a fake

He wears his heart safety-pinned to his backpack
His backpack is all that he knows
Shot down by strangers whose glances can cripple
The heart and devour the soul

All alone, he turns to stone
While holding his breath half to death
Terrified of what's inside
To save his life, he crawls like a worm from a bird
(All alone) Crawls like a worm from a bird

Don't tell on me, don't tell on me
No, don't you tell on me, please
It's okay, don't tell on me, please...

Must've been out of his mind (Out of his mind)
Mid-day delusions of pushing this out of his head
May be out of his mind (Out of his mind)

And you won't call me back
And it's fucked up
But at the same time it just made me want you even worse
For a while, I was cleaner than now
Then I started to destroy myself
With the things that I love now the things that I hate
Until it finally broke me

You almost always pick the best times to drop the worst lines
You almost made me cry again this time
Another false alarm, red flashing lights
Well, this time I'm not going' watch myself die
I think I made it a game to play your game and let myself cry
Buried myself alive on the inside, so I could shut you out
And let you go away for a long time… God!
I guess it's okay I puked the day away
I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way
And if you want me back, you're gonna have to ask
I think the chain broke away and I felt it the day
That I had my own time
I took advantage of myself and felt fine
But it was worth the night I caught an early flight
And I made it home
I guess it's okay I puked the day away
I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way
And if you want me back, you're gonna have to ask
Nicer than that, nicer than that
My foot on your neck, I finally have you
Right where I want you, right where I want you
Right where I want you, right where I want you
I guess it's okay I puked the day away
I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way

Just baptized

It called me, I should have known
As the fever sweat through the dream
Told mamma that I couldn't go
So I could stay home just to watch him dancing
And you could not tell me then
Like you could never, ever tell me now
That this is not who I am

Plans were made while my back was turned
Said Baby, that is no way to live
Showed me that carrot on a string but just a little too late
The bite from the taste and the smell of the sick somehow reminds me to be myself
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again

"Wanna be starting something" taught me to sing
Or maybe kiss, kiss Molly's lips
On a plain he will always live
And in a round he will always be dancing
Imagine where I'd be now
On these four legs I stand proud
It's the only way I know how to give
Plans were made while my back was turned
Said Baby, that is no way to live
Showed me that carrot on a string but just a little too late
The bite from the taste and the smell of the sick somehow reminds me to be myself
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again

Through the down
Glorified by what is ours
We've fallen in love

And sharper!
Found a box of sharp objects, what a beautiful

Seemed to stop my breath
My head on your chest waiting to cave in
From the bottom of my...
Hear your voice again
Could we dim the sun and wonder where we've been?
Maybe you and me, so kiss me like you did
My heart stopped beating, such a softer sin

I'm melting
I'm melting
In your eyes
I lost my place
Could stay a while
And I'm melting
In your eyes
Like my first time
That I caught fire
Just stay with me
Lay with me now

Never caught my breath
Every second I'm without you, I'm a mess
Ever know each other
Trust these words are stones
My cuts aren’t healing
Learning how to love
I'm melting
I'm melting
In your eyes
I lost my place
Could stay a while
And I'm melting
In your eyes
Like my first time
That I caught fire
Just stay with me
Lay with me now

You can stay and watch me fall
And of course I'll ask for help
Just stay with me now
We could take our heads off, stay in bed
Just make love, that's all
Just stay with me now

I'm melting
I'm melting
In your eyes
I lost my place
Could stay a while
And I'm melting

To whom it may concern
And all the tragic we've been through
No matter where I go
I keep on running into you
Blink of an eye
Feels like forever
Same as it ever was
Same as whatever
Before the yellow fades to blue

I'm shaken
I'm shaken
I'm shaken
I'm shaken

Can't bring myself to cut ties
I know you better than anyone
Blessed with this curse my whole life
Won't let me shake the shadow
Paradise lost in your eyes
I know you better than anyone
Blessed with this curse my whole life
Won't let me shake
I'm shaken
I'm shaken

Found the key but couldn't open the cell
This selfishness was part of saving myself
From you now I hold the disease
Planted the poisonous seed
Tried not to eat from the tree
Will I survive?
It's so hard to tell

Can't bring myself to cut ties
I know you better than anyone
Blessed with this curse my whole life
Won't let me shake the shadow
Paradise lost in your eyes
I know you better than anyone
Blessed with this curse my whole life
Won't let me shake

Life’s greatest questions have always been
Who am I? Where did I come from?
Why am I here? Where am I going?
You are about to see, and hear
One of the most significant messages given to us from God
Get down!
Get down!

I'm lying to myself and this dagger's my excuse
I'm a pawn, I should have paid up
And I left an hour late, I was laid up
I must abuse myself
I'm against all that I've made up
Set in stone the sun will come
And I hate the light
You know I hate the light

To me it looks so pretty burning

Burn the sun
Burn the light
Take take take take take take it away
Take my hand
Take my life
Take take take take take take it away
I must have caught something
In the heat of all these dances
I'm a worm with no more chances
And I've lost all doubt in a chemical romance
I can't stop itching over thoughts of tarnished hope
Kinda funny lonely feeling I'm not in love
You know it's not love

To me it looks so pretty burning

Burn the sun
Burn the light
Take take take take take take it away
Take my hand
Take my life
Take take take take take take it away
Burn the sun
Burn the light
Take take take take take take it away
Take my hand
Take my life
Take take take take take take it away
Brothers and sisters, I'm right here with you
‘Cause everyone's got one
A story to kill me
I'm so apathetic in my resentment
Living, loving, knowing not
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my... life
Take my heart
Take my mind
Take my lungs
Take my... Life!

When the shirt came off, it was all in time
When a m-m-m-minute turned into a mile
And then I broke that grin, and I cut it out
And you got all turned on by the taste of your sin
When I mentioned blue, all you thought was color
When you mentioned drugs, all I thought was sober
When your pants came off and I turned you over
When you mentioned blue

Kill
Smile
Cut it out for me this time
Smile, haven't seen him smile in a little while
Keep the mask aligned
Get it up in time
There's a space between valleys
And try and catch a vibe
Make a circle square
A rectangle curve
Use a smile as a noun and I think like a verb
Run quick switch sides
Spill the filled up cancer
And the room is shaking
Now you're changing places
And I switched my pace
And my breathing races when you mention blue
Kill

Cut it out for me this time
Smile, haven't seen him smile in a little while

To immortality almost, we wanted to write a song. It was like if I had five minutes to hold Tregen's hand, and if he had five minutes to hold his dad's hand, what would it be? What could we possibly say in those (what would you say?) moments?
I think I caught it in the chorus. I would say, "All I want to say to you is that your love never leaves me alone, and now you're right here. Hold my hand. Every single song I ever sing is for you."
It feels so good. This is as close as I'll get you know? He is right here
(Let's do it. He's right here too.)
Love you, bro
Love you too
(Ready? Alright.)
----------------------------------------------

First I was afraid of you
I knew you were afraid of me too
I did not know what to say
I saw your eyes closed and I knew
Though worlds apart your love it keeps the distance quite imaginary

All I want to say to you
Is that your love never leaves me alone
And now you’re right here; hold my hand;
Every single song I ever sing is for you
Is for you
Is for you
While I have your ear I need you to know
And though it sounds cliché
You made me the man that I am today
It would be more than disrespectful if I did not sing it loud

All I want to say to you
Is that your love never leaves me alone
And now you’re right here; hold my hand;
Every song I ever sing is for you
Is for you
Is for you

Breath
You’re keeping me worn
Like a squire
The quiet war
Suspicious acoustics
Leave cored empty spaces
Tracing my love escaped mercy’s said blessings to carnage; to taste it: A chance just to take it in

All of it
All of it
All of it
Just so many words
All I want to say to you
Is that your love never leaves me alone
And now you’re right here; hold my hand;
Every song I ever sing is for you
Is for you
Is for you
And now you’re right here; hold my hand;
Every song I ever sing is for you
Is for you
It's for youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

From the way that you acted
To the way that I felt it
It wasn't worth my time
And now it's sad cause all I missed
Wasn't that good to begin with
And now I've started you begging
Saying things that you don't mean
It isn't worth my time
A line's a dime a million times
And I'm about to see all of them
 x3
Goodbye to you, goodbye to you
You're taking up my time
You call my name when I wake up
To see things go your way
I'm coughing up my time
Each drag's a drop of blood, a grain
A minute of my life
It's all I've got just to stay down
Why the fuck am I still down?
I'm hoarding all that's mine
Each time I let just one slip by
I'm wasting what is mine

My time x3
 x2
I'm about to see a million things
I thought I'd never seen before and I
I'm about to do all of the things I've dreamed of
And I don't even miss you at all (Fuck you!)

See all those people on the ground, wasting time
I try to hold it all inside, but just for tonight
Top of the world, sitting here wishing
The things I've become, but something is missing
Maybe I, (fuck) what do I know

And now it seems that I have found, nothing at all
Want to hear your voice out loud, slow it down, slow it down
Without it all, I'm choking on nothing
It's clear in my head, that I'm screaming for something
Knowing nothing is better than knowing it all

On my own

The cup is not half empty as pessimists say
As far as he sees nothing's left in the cup
A whole cup full of nothing for him to indulge
Since the voice of ambition has long since been shut up

A singer, a writer, he's not dreaming now of going nowhere
He gave heed to nothing, and all that he was is just a tragedy

So he voyages in circles and succeeds getting nowhere
And submits to the substance, that first got him there
There, there, there

In violent frustration he cries out to God or just no one
Is there a point to this madness, and all that he was is just a tragedy

He feels alone
His heart in his hand, he's alone
He feels alone
I feel…

Then on that last day he breaks
And he stood tall, and he yelled, and he yelled
(Why world, why world, hate you, hate you, bye world)
In violent frustration he cries out to God or just no one
Is there a point to this madness, and all that he was is just a tragedy2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
***
As we trudge along through the mud and we tried to call it home
But we weren't alright, not at all, not for one, for one, for one second

Never have been one to write it down, now I think I can
I know I'm stronger now, who's looking South?
Not me, I'm not looking back, done denying the truth to anyone
Cause I'm alive

You showed me how you seemed to find a hole
But I just laughed and smiled begged and rolled my eyes
Even cried and denied the truth to you
Just like the truth to me mostly lied
I'm not going to look back x4
White it out glittering wax butterflies

I'm not going to look back x71EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It felt so heavy in my hands
Looking scary through your window
It wasn't really what I planned
I didn't think it'd be so simple

Blow me away
You wanna blow me away
Away, away

What if you found a gun?
Would you use it like I did?
Put a bullet in my head
I don't think you could
No, it isn't in your blood
The little boy inside my head
What if you found a gun?

Look what I did, I made a mess
Blood on my hands is sentimental
Could be that I was just depressed
It's never ever gonna end, no
Blow me away
You wanna blow me away
Away

What if you found a gun?
Would you use it like I did?
Put a bullet in my head
I don't think you could
No, it isn't in your blood
The little boy inside my head
What if you found a gun?

Imagine if you found it
Yeah, imagine if you found it
Like, wonder what that would sound like
I wanna hear that blow my mind
Into my hands, oh
Oh, I wanna hear that blow my mind

What if you found a gun?
Would you use it like I did?
Put a bullet in my head
I don't think you could
No, it isn't in your blood
The little boy inside my head
What if you found a gun?
See, I am the reason for
All the things that you do
See, I am the reason that
There is a killer in you
See, I am the reason that
You do what you do
Fuck all of the reasons that
There's a killer in you
Fuck the, the killer in you
Fuck the, the killer in youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
