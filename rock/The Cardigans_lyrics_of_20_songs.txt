Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know and
Maybe there is nothing that I can do
To make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought just to stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do

So I cry, and I pray, and I beg

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
So I cry and I beg for you to
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care about anything but you
Lately I have desperately pondered
Spent my nights awake and I wonder
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay
Reason will not lead to solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

So I cry, and I pray, and I beg

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
So I cry and I beg for you to
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care about anything but you
(Anything but you)
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
I know that you need me
I can't care about anything but you27EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I don't know what you're looking for
You haven't found it baby, that's for sure
You rip me up, you spread me all around
In the dust of the deed of time

And this is not a case of lust, you see
It's not a matter of you versus me
It's fine the way you want me on your own
But in the end it's always me alone
And I'm losing my favourite game
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my baby, losing my favourite game

I only know what I've been working for
Another you so I could love you more
I really thought that I could take you there
But my experiment is not getting us anywhere

I had a vision I could turn you right
A stupid mission and a lethal fight
I should've seen it when my hope was new
My heart is black and my body's blue
And I'm losing my favourite game
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my favourite game
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my baby, losing my favourite game

I'm losing my favourite game (losing my favourite game)
You're losing your mind again (I tried)
I tried but you're still the same (I tried)
I'm losing my baby
You're losing a saviour and a saint8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hey, what did you hear me say
You know the difference it makes
What did you hear me say
Yes, I said it's fine before
But I don't think so no more
I said it's fine before

I've changed my mind
I take it back

Erase and rewind
Cause I'll be changing my mind

Cause I'll be changing my mind
I've changed my mind

So where did you see me go?
It's not the right way, you know
Where did you see me go?
No, it's not that I don't know
I just don't want it to grow
It's not that I don't know

I've changed my mind
I take it back

Cause I'll be changing my mind

For twenty-seven years I've been trying
To believe and confide in
Different people I've found
Some of them got closer than others
And some wouldn't even bother
And then you came around
I didn't really know what to call you
You didn't know me at all
But I was happy to explain
I never really knew how to move you
So I tried to intrude through
The little holes in your veins
And I saw you
But that's not an invitation
That's all I get
If this is communication
I disconnect
I've seen you, I know you
But I don't know
How to connect
So I disconnect
You always seem to know where to find me
And I'm still here behind you
In the corner of your eye
I'll never really learn how to love you
But I know that I love you
Through the hole in the sky
Where I see you
And that's not an invitation
That's all I get
If this is communication
I disconnect
I've seen you, I know you
But I don't know
How to connect
So I disconnect
Well this is an invitation
Its not a threat
If you want communication
That's what you get
I'm talking and talking
But I don't know
How to connect
And I hold a record for being patient
With your kind of hesitation
I need you, you want me
But I don't know
How to connect
So I disconnect
I disconnect2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hey baby come around
Keep holding me down
And I'll be keeping you up tonight
A four letter word got stuck in my head
The dirtiest word that I've ever said
It's making me feel alright

For what it's worth I love you
And what is worse I really do
For what it's worth I'm going to run, run, run
Till the sweetness gets to you
And what is worse I love you

Hey please baby come back
There'll be no more loving attacks
And I'll be keeping it cool tonight
The four letter word is out of my head
Come on around get back in my bed
Keep making me feel alright

For what it's worth I like you
And what is worse I really do
Things has been worse and we had fun fun fun
Till I said I love you
And what is worse I really do
For what it's worth I love you
And what is worse I really do, ahhhh...

Man, I've had a few
But they wouldn't quite blow me like you
You gave me your name and signed
With a halo around my eye

And it hit me like never before
That love is a powerful force
Yes, it struck me that love is a sport
So I pushed you a little bit more

Love, you're news to me
You're a little bit more than I thought you'd be
A mole in my well-fed lawn
You're a nightmare beating the dawn

And it hit me like never before
That love is a powerful force
Yes, it struck me that love is a sport
So I pushed you a little bit more

Blue, blue, black and blue
Red blood sticks like glue
True love is cruel love
Red blood's a power fuel
Sweet love, tasty blood
My heart over floods
Oh you hit me
Yeah, you hit me really hard
Man, you hit me
Yeah you hit me right in the heart

Lord, I've had my deal
But I never quite knew how it feels
When love makes you wake up sore
With fists that are ready for more

And it hit me that love is a game
Like in war no one can be blamed
Yes, it struck me that love is a sport
So I pushed you a little bit more

Blue, blue, black and blue
Red blood sticks like glue
True love is cruel love
Red blood's a power fuel
Sweet love, tasty blood
My heart over floods
Man, you hit me
Yeah you hit me really hard
Baby, you hit me
Yeah you punched me right in the heart
And then you kissed me
And then you hit me
And then you kissed me
And then you hit me
Oh, you haunt me with your violent heartbeat at night
Oh, you strike me with your silence baby, tonight
Why you haunt me with your violence baby, come hit me
You haunt me with your violent heartbeatEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I came home in the morning and everything was gone
Oh, what have I done?
I dropped dead in the hallway
Cursing the dawn
Oh come on, sun, why must I burn?
I'm just trying to learn

I stared into the light to kill some of my pain
It was all in vain, 'cause no senses remained
But an ache in my body
And regret on my mind
But I'll be fine

'Cause I live and I learn
Yes, I live and I learn
If you live, you will learn
And I live and I learn

Got kicked in the head
So I started a fight
'Cause I knew I was right
But I learned I was wrong
I remember a slaughter
I remember I fought for the money I'd brought
I got blistered and burned
And lost what I'd earned
But I lived and I learned
Yes, I lived and I learned

I got, I got it now
I got, I got it now
(She’s got, she’s got it now)
I got, I got it now
(She’s got it now)
I got, I got it now
(She’s got, she’s got it now)

I came to on a corner
With some help from a man
And goddamn, I don’t seem to have learned
That a lady in need is guilty indeed
So I paid and got laid in return
And I don't know what I've learned

Well, you get what you give
And hell yes, I lived
But if you live as you learn
I don't think I can learn
Oh, with the sun in my eyes
Surprise, I'm living a life
But I don’t seem to learn
No, I don't think I can learn2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Till I go and kill the bottle

Break your heart and raise a glass or ten

Oh it's healing, bang bang bang
I can hear your cannons call
You've been aiming at my land
Your hungry hammer is falling

And if you want me, I'm your country

I'm an angel bored like hell
And you're a devil meaning well
You steal my lines and you strike me dumb
Come raise your flag upon me

And if you want me, I'm your country
If you win me, I'm forever, oh yeah

'Cause you're the storm that I've been needing
And all this peace has been deceiving
I like the sweet life and the silence
But it's the storm that I believe in

Come and conquer and drop your bombs
Cross my borders and kill the calm
Bear your fangs and burn my wings
I hear bullets singing
And if you want me, I'm your country
If you win me, I'm forever, oh yeah

'Cause you're the storm that I've been needing
And all this peace has been deceiving

Sick, tired and homeless
With no one here to sing for
Tired of being weightless
For all these looking good boys

You can always say my attic has its charm
You can always say you did no major harm
You can always say that summer had its charm
And that you did no major harm
Oh, spare me if you please

Sick, tired and sleepless
With no one else to shine for
Sick of all my distress
But I won't show I'm still poor

You can always say my attic has its charm
You can always say you did no major harm
You can always say that summer had its charm
And that you did no major harm

Nothing is complete
Nowhere to belong
Symptoms are so deep

Here on my own

There's a monster growing in our heads
Raised up on the wicked things we've said

A great divide between us now
Something we should know

There's something to remember
And something to forget
As long as we remember
There's something to regret
Something we should know

There's a mountain higher than we knew
It's high but such a bitter view

A great divide between us now
Something we should know

There's something to remember
And something to forget
As long as we remember
There's something to regret
A great divide between us now
On different sides of a great divide

There's something to remember
And something to forget
As long as we remember
There's something to regret

I am iron man

Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all?
Or if he moves will he fall?

Is he live or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

Oh, iron man

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Now the time is here
For iron man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Plan his vengeance
That he will soon unfold
No, nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
And nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge
Oh

Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron man lives again

So you're trying to do what they did
Your friends that turn to liquid
And got lost in the sea
Now you're drowning me
With your talk of four-leaf clovers
You turn to rocks and omen
To beat the ambient harm
That is bruising your karma

Oh I wish my arms were wider
I wish that I could hide you
So you can rest and repair

Without the blanket of sorrow
The thick and the grey
Your blanket of woe
Is so heavy and stained
And it only weighs you down

So you thought that getting sober
Would mean your life was over
I don't think it's that bad
I don't think it's that sad
Just you sleep a little, baby
Leave the world alone and later
If you wake up alive
That old blanket of sorrow
Could be feathers and down
Your blanket of woe
Would leave you alone
And I can love you 'til you drown

Come to me let's drown
Come baby let's drown
In feathers and down1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You in brown checked suit
Said my dress was very cute
I found you found me
Dancing in this melody
Heavenly!

We were swinging on so nice
Bubbly pink champagne on ice
Nancy, Jacques Clouseau and Claire
I believe they all were there
Having the time of their lives

You had Rose's lime
Mixed with vodka, I had wine
People having fun
Cocktails in the evening sun
Give me one!

I wonder what it's like seeing through your eyes
You've offered me to have a try but I was always late
The filters that I use give me an excuse
I take away what's real, I feel it and it blows my fuse

I hang around for another round
I'm hanging around for another round
I'm hanging on to the same old song
I hang around for another round
Until something stops me

I wonder what it's like walking by your side
To think before I talk and to move at the same speed as you walk
I wanna have a way to keep me in your state
I'm watching from above, I love it but it's not for me

I hang around for another round
I'm hanging around for another round
I'm hanging on to the same old song
I hang around for another round
