You know it's the place I need
But you got me walking circles like a dog on a lead
And the doctors say I'm crazy, that I'm eight miles thick
I'm like the taste of macaroni on a seafood stick
And you got me switched on, baby, like electric eel
And I'm tight with Axel Foley, that's just how I feel
Like a grapefruit and a magic trick, the prodigal son
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking, I walk so quick

And it just don't mean a thing
We've been waiting far too long
We'll play it out again
This is just my serenade

You're in love with a psycho
You're in love with a psycho
And there's nothing you can do about it
I got you running all around it
You're in love with a psycho
You're in love with a psycho
And there's nothing you can do about it
You never gonna be without it
Jibber jabber at the Bargain Booze
And reciting Charles Bukowski, I got nothing to lose
And I wait for you to follow me to share my chips
But you're walking, you're walking, you walk, you walk so quick

Nobody's gonna take you there
I stick around for the thousand yard stare
I go to sleep in a duffle bag
I'm never up, never down, down, down, down

Hey, you're in love with a psycho
You're in love with a psycho
And there's nothing you can do about it
I got you running all around it
You're in love with a psycho
You're in love with a psycho
And there's nothing you can do about it
You're never gonna be with--

Maybe this way we'll find a solution
Maybe this way we'll find a solution
But we're far too lost to find it
You're in love with a psycho
You're in love with a psycho
And there's nothing you can do about it
I got you running all around it
You're in love with a psycho
Tu amor es muy loco
And there's nothing you can do about it
You never gonna be without it1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

King Pin on a cutback
King Pin on a cutback
With sunken eyes
Big cheese in a bedsit
Big cheese in a bedsit
A shit, disguise

Stick and move, said you want to try me
You should've left it just where you found it
I see you dreaming, thinking what it could be
You'll have to trust me, just don't believe me

Reap what you sow
Comeback Kid
Says hello
Here, here we stand
Side by side
Don't let go (of my hand)

Sasquatch in a bin bag
Sasquatch in a bin bag
It's no surprise
Nosebleed in a pound shop
Nosebleed in a pound shop
Spitting flies

Stick and move, said you want to try me
You should've left me just where you found me
Say goodnight, I'm 'bout to hypnotize you
Here it comes I just thought I'd warn you

Reap what you sow
Comeback Kid
Says hello
Here, here we stand
Side by side
Don't let go (of my hand)

Back when you know you shoulda sent to do it on a mission
You were the only one who said you'd stay if you could have it
I guess you want it, guess you want it, guess you want it
I guess you want it, guess you want it, guess you want it
I still don't know if you do want it, do you want it, do you?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it, do you?
Reap what you sow

Wow!
You're telling me about this, I tell you about about that
Stop talking shit you walk into another trap
When all the time you know
You know my name, you know my name, you know my name
Just settle down, you're losing the plot
It took you a lifetime to get where you got
If I had it all, I'd be dead in a week
If I had my way, be king for a day

Wow!
What's your band called mate? What, what's your band called mate?
I'm sorry, oh I'm sorry, but it's far too late
Trying to start a war
I heard it all before
Now go fetch me a milkshake, don't forget the straw

Now I don't have the time to listen to this
Don't know by now, then the point you have missed
Look what you've got
It's love that it's not
Don't care what they say, be king for a day, be king for a day
We got the night, we got the world
Into the future I give you my word
Open your eyes into the light, into the light

Wow!
You smell of hotel soap, trying to tell your joke
Over and over just blowing smoke
Industry standard time after time
The higher the mountain, the higher I climb

What is the point in trying to pretend?
In single file we queue till the end
Look what you've got
It's love that it's not
Don't care what they say, be king for a day, be king for a day
Take all you fuckers and blow you away

We got the night, we got the world
Into the future I give you my word
Open your eyes into the light, into the light

Free from love, free from life
Free from you I'm untouchable
Free from pain, free from ego
Free to rave I am rising
I'm rising up, I'm rising up, I'm rising up, I'm rising
Wow!
You're telling me about this, I tell you about about that
Stop talking shit you walk into another trap
When all the time you know
You know my name, you know my name, you know my name
Be king for a day, be king for a day

We got the night, we got the world
Into the future I give you my word
Open your eyes into the light, into the light

King for a day4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Summer is here once again
So I'm told
But you won't catch me in my shorts
I'd rather just sit in this bar and drink all day
Knowing that you'll wander in through the door, door

There's been so much time wasted without you by my side
Remember how we danced off our heads
Under streetlights such a mad ride
Running from our friends to kiss you in the alleyways by the riptide
There was only us in our world
And the music it never died, never died, never died

Summer is here once again
And there you are
I see you're alone so I make my move
Give me the eyes the ones that lit the fuse
The eyes that could lift up my feet off the ground, ground, ground

There's been so much time wasted without you by my side
Remember how we danced off our heads
Under streetlights such a mad ride
Running from our friends to kiss you in the alleyways by the riptide
There was only us in our world
And the music it never died, never died, never died
Come on now, come on now
Come on let's get together
Come on now, come on now
Come on let's get together

There's been so much time wasted without you by my side
Remember how we danced off our heads
Under streetlights such a mad ride
Running from our friends to kiss you in the alleyways by the riptide
There was only us in our world
And the music it never died, never died, never died
There's been so much time wasted without you by my side

One, take control of me?
You're messing with the enemy
Said it's two, it's another trick
Messing with my mind, I wake up
Chase down an empty street
Blindly snap the broken beats
Said it's gone, with the dirty trick
It's taken all these days to find ya

Ha ha-ha-ha ha-ha
I tell you, I want you
Ha ha-ha-ha ha-ha
I tell you, I need you

Friends, take control of me
Stalking cross the gallery
All these pills got to operate
The colour quits and all invade us
There it goes again
Take me to the edge again
All I got, is a dirty trick
I'm chasing down all wolves to save ya

Kill me if you dare
Hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself right on this train
I'm the underdog
Live my life on a lullaby
Keep myself riding on this train
Keep myself riding on this train

Love in technicolor, sprayed out on walls
Well I've been pounding at the pavement
'Til there's nothing at all
I got my cloak and dagger
In a bar room brawl
See the local loves a fighter
Loves a winner to fall

Feels like I'm lost in a moment
I'm always losing to win
Can't get away from the moment
Seems like it's time to begin

Kill me if you dare
Hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself right on this train
I'm the underdog
Live my life on a lullaby
Keep myself riding on this train
Keep myself riding on this train
It don't matter
I won't do what you say
You've got the money and the power
I won't go your way
I can't take for the people
They don't matter at all
And I'll be waiting in the shadows
'Til the day that you fall

Feels like I'm lost in a moment
I'm always losing to win
Can't get away from the moment
Seems like it's time  to begin

Kill me if you dare
Hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself right on this train
I'm the underdog
Live my life on a lullaby
Keep myself riding on this train

Tell me if you're down
Throw your weapons to the ground
Keep myself right on this train
Paper on the wire
Sold your soul for another one
Keep myself riding on this train
Keep myself riding on this train9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss
I'd broke my wrist
It all kicked off
I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind
'Cos love's hard to find

La la la la
Maybe the days we had are gone
Living in silence far too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

Turning slowly
Looking back, see
No words can save this
You're broken and I'm pissed
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope some day that we will meet again
Running wild
Giving it everyone, now that's all done
'Cos we burnt out, that's what you do
When you have everything, it can't be true

La la la la
Maybe the days we had are gone
Living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
The last stand
Let go of my hand

Turning slowly
Looking back, see
No words can save this
You're broken and I'm pissed
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope some day that we will meet again
You go your way and
I'll go my way
No words can save us
This lifestyle made us
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope some day that we can meet againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Stevie, where you going with that gun?
Who you wanna shoot down?
Who you trying to kill?

You've been watching too much TV
It's playing with your memories
It's trying to break your heart

Just calm down, take your medication
It numbs you to the world
Not my world

Live to fight another day
Live to fight again
And all the kids they say
Live to fight another day
Live to fight again, again, again, again

There's no life underneath your finger
I dreamt a little bigger
I'm sick and tired of this
If you show us what we can't have
What do you expect when
We take it back from you

'Cause it's no joke, no joke
I wanna open up your eyes wide, eyes wide
I feel it coming but you can't hide, can't hide

This is a call Tom at Nowkay Avenue;
I just wanna log on when he tells me, okay?

Too much information
Well I said you're good for nothing
Come on to the back
I said your needles count for something
Guess I'd better sell you now
Guess I'd be around
Singing for your questions
But you've stolen all of my answers
Too much entertainment drove
And that's not all the color
Tell me that you've seen a ghost
I'll tell you what to fear the most

Stop!
I said it's happening again!
We're all wasting away!
We're all wasting away!

Too much information
Well I said you're good for nothing
Stitch your part of counterfeit
I said you're far out here
Taking at the roads
Where you're taken for the simple codes
Swimming with the fishes
While the serpent waves his tongue
With a belly full of splinters
Now you see that I'm the one
Tell me that you've seen a ghost
I'll tell you what to fear the most

Stop!
I said it's happening again!
We're all wasting away!
We're all wasting away!

Old green fairy, what you’ve done to me
I see Lucy in the sky telling me I’m high
I went out for some milk three days ago
I met Dali in the street, he knocked me off my feet

Oh, oh, oh (Ah)

Now I start to see that all’s not well
There’s policemen in my bed telling me I’m dead
If only I could show them what I’ve seen
I’ll have to take you down below where insects run the show

Sound and vision turning inside out
The lines make you look older then you’re gone

And everyday I got someone bringing me down
I got the eyes of a madman, I’m chasing round
How does it feel to live your life where nothing is real?
So just send me down the river

The neighbours say that I need locking up
Well they wouldn’t be the first to want me in a hearse
No one sleeps for I am still awake
Pass me over La Fée Verte, I’ll give you all a scare
Dogs in handbags, everyone’s a star
You look behind your eyelids then you’re gone

And everyday I got someone bringing me down
I got the eyes of a madman, I’m chasing round
How does it feel to live your life where nothing is real?
So just send me down the river

I’m not gonna wait for tomorrow
I just look back and wait for a sign
And I’m not gonna celebrate my freedom
So just send me down the river
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na

And everyday I got someone bringing me down
I got the eyes of a madman, I can't look round
How does it feel to live your life where nothing is real?
So just send me down the river8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

A fearless rescue from everyone
Who made you the master?
The lady caster?
I found you looking for a good time
I was out in exile
Perfecting my style

Hit me, harder
I'm getting re-wired
I flip the switch that makes you feel electric
Even, faster
Than before
Gonna light em' up with you
Gonna light em' up with you
Try light em' up

Try to keep up, you scatter brain
She will enter, through your vein
Who was your creator?
The one who made you?
The flame I need to heat the silver
You bring Gods to their knees
Pick out the bad seeds
Relieve the Generals from their duty
Hit me, harder
I'm getting re-wired
I flip the switch that makes you feel electric
Even, faster
Than before
Gonna light em' up with you
Gonna light em' up with you

It tastes so bitter
There's no retreat, for I surrender

You're aiming backwards, of this I'm sure
Have you had enough?
Are you feeling rough?
Does your skull hurt?

Face check I walk this beach
I'm frying in the heat in the cauldron stir me
Chomp down my diamond teeth I ain't got
The simple things in life I feel like
You have got to witness
This is your last retreat
My last repeat

All my friends are as sharp as razors
Cut you down if you touch the faders
High class girls hung in elevators
Now we have got the floor

Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
You can't miss me I'm still alive
Snake skin shoe-d, I'm pleading homicide
Come on and feel this I'm still alive
Joker meet you on the other side

Banshie I hear you call
We need to raise the dead, we need to raise the people
Cut throat this blood runs thick
It is true the simple things in life have been lost
You have got to witness
We are the last beatniks
The lost heretics
All my friends are as sharp as razors
Cut you down if you touch the faders
Listen up all you masqueraders
Now we have got the floor
Now we have got the floor

Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose (yeah)
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose (yeah)
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose (yeah)
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
You can't miss me I'm still alive
Snake skin shoe-d, I'm pleading homicide
Come on and feel this I'm still alive
Joker meet you on the other side
(This is your last...)
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
(This is your last...)
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose
Get loose get loose, Get loose get loose1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We're just looking for some action
Just looking for some action, over here
Everybody in the place now
We're giving you the chance to disappear
To disappear, to disappear, to disappear

Broken bottles, leather biscuits
I see no way of getting outta here
I can't hear you, better use a speak and spell
It's such a lovely way of getting out of it

We're just looking for some action
Just looking for some action, over here
Everybody in the place now
We're giving you the chance to disappear
We're just looking for some action
Just looking for some action, over here
Everybody in the place now
We're giving you the chance to disappear
To disappear, to disappear, to disappear

Give up get down get your flashlight
Everybody down into the basement
Give up get down, until the sunlight
They'll be sweeping you up off the pavement
Give up get down get your flashlight
Everybody down into the basement
Give up get down, until the sunlight
They'll be sweeping you up off the pavement
Tollbooth parking Ford Fiesta
Got me licking on your '99
Satsumas crawling with your ski boots on
I said I've never met anybody as high as you

We're just looking for some action
Just looking for some action, over here
Everybody in the place now
We're giving you the chance to disappear
We're just looking for some action
Just looking for some action, over here
Everybody in the place now
We're giving you the chance to disappear
To disappear, to disappear, to disappear

Give up get down get your flashlight
Everybody down into the basement
Give up get down, until the sunlight
They'll be sweeping you up off the pavement
Give up get down get your flashlight
Everybody down into the basement
Give up get down, until the sunlight
They'll be sweeping you up off the pavement
Give up get down get your flashlight
Everybody down into the basement
Give up get down, until the sunlight
They'll be sweeping you up off the pavement
Give up get down get your flashlight
Everybody down into the basement
Give up get down, until the sunlight
They'll be sweeping you up off the pavement
Give up get down get your flashlight
Give up get down get your flashlight
Give up get down get your flashlight
Give up get down get your flashlight1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
