I was born long ago
I am the chosen I'm the one
I have come to save the day
And I won't leave until I'm done
So that's why you've got to try
You got to breathe and have some fun
Though I'm not paid I play this game
And I won't stop until I'm done

But what I really want to know is
Are you going to go my way?
And I got to, got to know

I don't know why we always cry
This we must leave and get undone
We must engage and rearrange
And turn this planet back to one
So tell me why we got to die
And kill each other one by one
We've got to hug and rub-a-dub
We've got to dance and be in love

But what I really want to know is
Are you going to go my way?
And I got to, got to know
Are you going to go my way?

I've been searching for you
I heard a cry within my soul
I've never had a yearning quite like this before
Know that you are walking right through my door

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?

A sacred gift of heaven
For better worse, wherever
And I would never let somebody break you down
Until you cried, never

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
At every time I've always known
That you were there
Upon your throne
A lonely queen without her king
I longed for you
My love forever


All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?

You are the flame in my heart
You light my way in the dark
You are the ultimate star
You pick me up from above
Your unconditional love
Takes me to paradise

I belong to you
And you
You belong to me too
You make my life complete
You make me feel so sweet

You make me feel so divine
Your soul and mind are entwined
Before you, I was blind
But since I've opened my eyes
And with you there's no disguise
So I could open up my mind
I always loved you from the start
But I could not figure out
That I had to do it every day
So I put away the fight
Now I'm gonna live my life
Giving you the most in every way

For the planet, for the people
For every living thing upon this world, yeah
For destruction and the hatred (oh, the hatred)
Is about to take us down for good

What's in all those trails, up there, in the sky?
Why has all the food become modified?
Pushing all your drugs just to keep us high
While the media propagates the lie

Check mate you're done and then you were gone

A life that can't be beat
Yet still I feel this heat

Mr. Cab Driver, you're never gonna win
Mr. Cab Driver won't stop to pick me up
Mr. Cab Driver, I might need some help
Mr. Cab Driver only thinks about himself
Here we go

Mr. Cab Driver
Mr. Cab Driver
Mr. Cab Driver
Mr. Cab Driver

Mr. Cab Driver don't like the way I look
He don't like dreads, he thinks we're all crooks
Mr. Cab Driver reads too many story books
Mr. Cab Driver pass me up with eyes of fire
Mr. Cab Driver thinks we're all one-sixty-fivers
Mr. Cab Driver, fuck you, I'm a survivor
Ah yeah, one more time, uh-huh
Let me in, oh

My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars
And you're the only one that could take me this far
I'll be forever searching for your love

I walked away but I was wrong
You're the one that keeps me strong
You're the fire that keeps me warm
How will I get through this storm?

At night, I pray before I sleep in hope of finding you
I've opened up my heart, I want you to come through
I close my eyes, I'm searching for your love

I walked away but I was wrong
You're the one that keeps me strong
You're the fire that keeps me warm
How will I get through this storm?

Yes, yes
I got the bounce Lenny
Check me out
Brooklyn's Bad Boy back again
Feet hit the ground running and my back's to the wind
Angels on my shoulders, head in the clouds
No I'm not rapping I'm just thinking out loud
My karma's my armor, my charm and wit
Is like a leather bomber, I'm warm and shit
And I did bad for good but when you're trapped in the hood
You do worse for less, homie earth's a test
Only God can judge me, my heart isn't ugly
But the thoughts that I drop is heavy, try to budge me
Momma loved me, Pop left me
Still the homies call me Lucky Lefty
I'm flashy and deadly, deceptively smart
I make hustling heaven and pimping an art
Long as I know that I'm blessed and I'm loved in depth
I can walk through water and not get wet, I'm that fresh!

I walked away but I was wrong
You're the one that keeps me strong
You're the fire that keeps me warm
How will I get through this storm?

There you have it
Young Hov, Lenny Kravitz
Not your average
Get your umbrella
It's raining macs and broads
All grace to God
I walked away but I was wrong
You're the one that keeps me strong
You're the fire that keeps me warm
How will I get through this storm?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You’re, making it feel that everything is alright
You’re my sunflower, you’re my sunflower
In a world that’s crumbling, all around us everyday
You are, all the inspiration that I need to find my way
How long I’ve been yearning, for the day I find my one true love
Now that you are here my darling, I want you to stay (I want you to stay)

You’re, making it feel that everything is alright
You’re my sunflower, you’re my sunflower
You’re, making it feel that everything is alright
You’re my sunflower, you’re my sunflower

Whenever you call me, I’ll be there with no delay, my love
Even when I’m miles away girl, my heart will be there (I’ll be right there)
Any conversation that you want to have, you’ll have my ear
You can tell me all your secrets, they’ll be safe my dear

You’re, making it feel that everything is alright
You’re my sunflower, you’re my sunflower
You’re, making it feel that everything is alright
You’re my sunflower, you’re my sunflower
I’m not that good with words, but I’m a try my best
Look, I don’t wanna ever make you mad girl
I just wanna have you see you know the things young men are hesitant to have girl
A little you a little me and someone else, good lord that’s a winner right there
But we really got a story to tell, it can’t finish right there
I used to wonder what my old girl doing right now
Ever since you came into my life
Everytime I think it’d be good to call her
I just think about you and it’d make me think twice, ah yeah
Yeah, I know we’ve been through a couple things
You know a couple things, what are we to do
But you make me feel good, cause you love me for me and you love me for you
Come on

You’re, making it feel that everything is alright (it’s gon be alright)
You’re my sunflower, you’re my sunflower
You’re, making it feel that everything is alright
You’re my sunflower, you’re my sunflowerEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
