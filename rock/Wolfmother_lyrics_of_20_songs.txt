I said the joker is a wanted man
He makes his way all across the land
I see him sifting through the sand
So I'll tell you all the story
'Bout the joker and the thief in the night
He's always laughing in the midst of power
Always living in the final hour
There is always sweet in sour
So we are not goin' home

Can you see the joker flying over
As she's standing in the field of clover
Watching out everyday?
I wonder what would happen if he took her away

What you see well you might not know
You get the feelin' comin' after the glow
The vagabond is moving slow
So I'll tell you all the story
'Bout the joker and the thief in the night
All the people that he see in the night
Hold their dreams up to the light
The wilder beast is searching for sight
And we are not going home
Can you see the joker flying over
As she's standing in the field of clover
Watching out everyday?
I wonder what would happen if he took her away

I said the joker is a wanted man
Makes his way all across the land
See him sifting through the sand
So I'll tell you all the story 'bout the joker and the thief
I said, I'll tell you the story 'bout the joker and the thief
I said, tell the story 'bout the joker and the thief in the night12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

This is a song about the innocence lost
Oh girl I don't know all the reasons why
I found the answer lookin' in your eye
I go out walking all day long
Take away this lonely man soon he will be gone

'Cause I'll tell you everything about living free
Yes I can see you girl, can you see me?

You don't need to know what I do all day
It's as much as I know watch it waste away

'Cause I'll tell you everything about living free
Yes I can see you girl, can you see me?

Go and see the sorcerer look into the ball
You may find the answer written on the wall
The left one was a dancer can you see the answer, oh!

Put her in a mansion on top of the hill
Please don't make her do things against her will
I found something special I don't know why
Looking into her pretty little eye
'Cause I'll tell you everything about being free4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It seems the competition is riding on her tail
It seems that they were hoping she, hoping she would fail
The town has come to raise our guns to the sun
But she will prove herself worthy
She will be the one

She will be victorious
And won't get the battle loss
Always-a mysterious
Cause she will be victorious

It seems that they are plotting out, plotting out destruction
With the things that they have made around their own construction
And can't you see that we are all the masters of our destiny?
And she won't be called the victim of your faded memory

She will be victorious
And won't get the battle loss
Always-a mysterious
Cause she will be victorious

Don't you ever get tired and feel like giving up?
Don't you ever feel like, like you've had enough?
Don't you ever get tired of wondering what's wrong or right?
Don't you ever get tired and feel like giving up?
It seems that I just thought they could take their sweet time
Sippin' cocktails in the sun, enjoying the sunshine
She can't wait to unleash, unleash all her rage
With an electric guitar and blow them off the stage

She will be victorious
And won't get the battle loss
Always-a mysterious
Cause she will be victorious

Cause she will be victorious1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Have you been to the carnival
I would like to see you
There's a whole lot of people there
Who would like to be you
With the white unicorn, across her shoulder
Makes you think that she might of been
Someone whose older, ahh yeahhh

And I know it's on your mind
We've been drinking on the wine
That we drank from the serpents vine
Now we live in another time

We could live together

She lives on the borderline
That they call hazel
And the tent that she lives in has the name of her lover

And I know it's on your mind
We've been drinking on the wine

Sister can you tell me when the day turns to night
She left without a word and wondered inside
How many day's must I still wonder why
And see her face in every passer by

I fell down in the desert, baby, yeah
Well, I had nothing but a piece of paper, oh yeah
I had to write something down
And I found myself alone
Then I let go of everything into another dimension

The purple haze is in the sky
See the angel's wicked eye
All these things we must try
Until we see the reasons why, oh yeah

Lightning crash on the hill tonight, yeah
And I got a feeling everything is gonna be alright
Then a horse came running to me
Said, we're gonna go to the sanctuary
Then a storm began to blow into another dimension

The purple haze is in the sky
See the angel's wicked eye
All these things we must try
Until we see the reasons why, yeah yeah

They were drumming with the golden bones
Building dreams in front of their homes

I saw the colossal landscape
Of which I never was a part
It was a magical day
Of which Id never seen before

The first time I saw colossal girl

Such glowing mountains before us
Pillars of life all fade away
Of all the things I need to say girl
All of these words are in my way

The first time I saw colossal girl

Well, she's running to the hills again
Can you tell me if she'll ever return?
She must be mother natures child
'Cause she's runnin' to the call of the wild
She's talkin' to the trees again
Tellin' me that she's one of them
Lookin' at the bird in the tree
Though she's never gonna notice me, no
Oh is my love a confession
Will I just put it back today?
If I had a love to give you
Would you still throw it all away?

The first time I saw colossal girl

Can you remember the first time we met
Living together in colossal times
Some things are given with no reason why
Living together all of the time
I'm just a gypsy with wondering eyes
I'll tell you secrets that send you to sleep
All I can give you is all of my love
These are the things I can give you to keep, oh

When the time is right and the night is bright
We will see the things we've come to find
I've been searching for just a little more
But the days girl just slip away
And the red sunset that we just met girl
I can see forever

Come and see the Mind's Eye
We can find it if we try
Come and see the Mind's Eye
Transfixed upon the why
Come and see the Mind's Eye
We can find it if we try

Well they say it's right if it feels alright
When your love burns up in the mire
So I burnt a fire for a lost desire
See it burning higher

They came from 10,000 feet
On a possibility street
It was the law of the land
Turned castles into the sand
When it's only kingdoms a turning
When I've got to find out some learning
Even the people so small
Wanna see the tyrant fall
Oh yeah

You could be

Another torture tale

Watching the factories burning
Even the mountain so tall
Will see the tyrant fall

Well we always seem to worry
Life's becoming such a flurry
Can't you see that there's light in the dark
Nothing is quite what it seems in the city of dreams
Rainbows tinted with gold
All the stories we've been told
Still her love is yours to behold
Nothing is quite what it seems in the city of dreams

You say it's not the real world
Though it seems so real to me
And I know that we're never turning back
Can you see what I see
I had a vision
Of festive days
She's like an eagle
In the misted haze

Sit and wonder at the sky
Watch the river flowing by
Now it ends and we're here at the start
Nothing is quite what it seems in the city of dreams

Oh break my chains girl
Show me to the land
Where people live together

Can you tell me if it's just a feeling?
I see the light shining in your eyes
Is it love just in disguise?

I saw the light shine out today
I saw the light shine out today
And it told me that, that you're not the one for me
That you're not the one for me

Can you hear the ancient calling?
I see the empires we built are falling
All we have is a human touch, ah
The clock is ticking even as we rush, ahEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When you're far away, when you're far away?
The nights are long, well, it's something that you never seen
But it's hard to say, but it's hard to say
Don't listen to the words they say
They can take it or leave it anyway
Just let it go another day
Step down from the mountainside
Well, I see that you're doing fine
When you're far away, when you're far away
Well, you tell me that you're coming down
Well, it's good to see that you're back around
But it's hard to say, I was far away
Don't listen to the words they say
They could never believe you anyway

In the pouring rain
Just to see your face again
Pretty Peggy
I used to know
Where have you gone, where did you go?

Take my hand
Give me a chance
Can I have you just for one dance?
They say I am
But a foolish man
Can I be your fool and take your hand?

We will stand tall
We will never fall
Pretty Peggy
We could have it all

Roses are red
Violets are blue
I will take them all
And give them to you
I will stand here
In the pouring rain
Just to see your face again
Take my hand
Give me a chance
Can I have you just for one more dance?
They say I am
But a foolish man
Can I be your fool and take your hand?

Could it be what you see
Many things are extraordinary?
Every time when I look at you
Well, I seem to find another thing behind the story
Every time when I look at you
Well, I seem to find another dream behind the glory

And now it seems no time at all
The sundial wonders
How could you see nothing at all?

Took a walk in the park
I work another round in the after hour
Sometimes people like
To take away all of your love and power
Every time when I look into
Well, I seem to find another scene behind the story
Every time when she looks at you
Well, I seem to find another dream behind the glory

Oh my friend, don't get caught in yesterday
All the things, we've heard have left and made their way
Lower your guns even if love has turned to spite
We may find the enemy waiting inside
Light the candle to see what may unfold
If you listen to the sound within your mind
You may find the answer flowing in the tide
Say goodbye to your sorrow
And hello to tomorrow
Well, I hear the fiddler's call
Say that love is here for all
So I wrote her a letter
And I tried to forget her
Well, I don't know if I'll go
Can you hear the river flow?

Oh sister, can you tell me if it's gonna be okay?

Calling out without a sound

And she drank from the craft

Her eyes are the opening to a soul
Spirits lie where secrets can be told
Yeah, make her an offer, your fortune can be sold

Say hello to all those wayward eyes

How does it feel to have yearned?
The gift that she gave was given to be given away

Tell me every word you say
