Let it never be said
The romance is dead
Cause there's so little else
Occupying my head
There is nothing I need
Except the function to breathe
But I'm not really fussed
Doesn't matter to me

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Know what you're doing, doing, to me?
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby

Due to lack of interest
Tomorrow is canceled
Let the clocks be reset
And the pendulums held
'Cause there's nothing at all
Except the space in-between
Finding out what you're called
And repeating your name
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Know what you're doing, doing, to me
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby

Could it be, could it be
That you're joking with me?
And you don't really see you and me
Could it be, could it be
That you're joking with me?
And you don't really see you and me

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Know what you're doing, doing, to me

Do you, do you, do you, do you

Watching the people get lairy
It's not very pretty I tell thee
Walking through town is quite scary
It's not very sensible either
A friend of a friend he got beaten
He looked the wrong way at a policeman
Would never have happened to Smeaton
An Old Leodensian

La...la la la la la
Ah...la la la la la

I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot

I tried to get to my taxi
The man in a tracksuit attacks me
He said that he saw it before me
And wants to get things a bit gory
Girls scrabble round with no clothes on
To borrow a pound for a condom
If it wasn't for chip fat they'd be frozen
They're not very sensible
La...la la la la la
Ah...la la la la la

I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot

And if there's anybody left in here
That doesn't want to be out there
Ah...

Everyday I love you less and less
It's clear to see that you've become obsessed
I got to get this message to the press
That everyday I love you less and less
And everyday I love you less and less
I've got to get this feeling off my chest
The doctor says all I need is pills and rest
Since everyday I love you less and less

Unless, unless, I know, I feel it in my bones
I'm sick, I'm tired of staying in control
Oh yes, I feel, a rat upon a wheel
I got to know what's not and what is real
Oh yes, I'm stressed, I'm sorry I digress
Impressed, you dressed to S.O.S

Ooh, and my parents love me (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Ooh, and my girlfriend loves me, ooh (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)

Everyday I love you less and less
I can't believe once you and me did sex
It makes me sick to think of you undressed
Since everyday I love you less and less
And everyday I love you less and less
You're turning into something I detest
And everybody says that you're a mess
Since everyday I love you less and less
Unless, unless, I know, I feel it in my bones
I'm sick, I'm tired of staying in control
Oh yes, I feel, a rat upon a wheel
I got to know what's not and what is real
Oh yes, I'm stressed, I'm sorry I digress
Impressed, you dressed to S.O.S

Ooh, and my parents love me (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Ooh, and my girlfriend loves me (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)

Time on your side that will never end
The most beautiful thing you can ever spend
But you work in a shirt with your name tag on it
Drifting apart like a plate tectonic

It don't matter to me
Cause all I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar

Too much time spent dragging the past up
I didn't see you not looking when I messed up
Settling down in your early twenties
Sucked more blood than a backstreet dentist

It don't matter to me
Cause all I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar

Oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
Great rulers make for greater glory
The only thing growing is our history
Knock me down I'll get right back up again
I'll come back stronger than a powered up Pac-Man

It don't matter to me
Cause all I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar

Oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
Oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home

I'm a record collection, a dedicated section
I'm a memory of everything you've ever seen and ever done
I'm a subtle seduction, I am out of corruption
I'm a God enlightened, cleaned up, heightened reenactment of your day
I'm a hidden agenda, hidden in a credenza
In the darkest corner of the room inside the room inside your head
Uh-huh, inside your head
Inside your head, inside your head, uh

Sit back and relapse into the world we built for you
Where everything you'll need is on its way now
Make yourself at home, my extraordinary friend
Where everything is okay in the end

Thinking of a number
Whispered in our gun
Trouble hidden, pass it on
Zero, zero, zero, one
Play us one more number
Give us one more song
Tell us one we've heard before
Zero, zero, zero, more
Architecturally speaking, 50 gram is a weakling
I'm a city planner with a stammer who cut down New York, New York
From the tip of a rhino, fuck it if I know
I'm the unexpected, twist your endless laundry list of heinous crimes
Take a vital suggestion, rig an election
I'm the hidden top line of the tune that's on a loop inside your mind
Uh-huh, inside your mind
Inside your mind, inside your mind, uh

Sit back and relapse into the world we built for you
Where everything you'll need is on its way now
Make yourself at home, my extraordinary friend
Where everything is okay in the end

Thinking of a number
Whispered in our gun
Trouble hidden, pass it on
Zero, zero, zero, one
Play us one more number
Give us one more song
Tell us one we've heard before
Zero, zero, zero, more
On an endless corridor behind each hidden door
Infinity at one more never-ending bidding war
Send us your details, my extraordinary friend
Everything is okay if you

Sit back and relapse into the world we built for you
Where everything you'll need is on its way now
Make yourself at home, my extraordinary friend
Where everything is okay in the endEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I can prove anything, I'll make you admit again and again
That I can prove anything the way that it's writ again and again

And it's only cause you came here with your brothers too
If you came here on your own you'd be dead
It's only cause you follow what the others do
It's no excuse to say you're easily led

You could choose anything and you choose to lose again and again
And you could do anything but why should you do anything again

And it's only cause you came here with your brothers too
If you came here on your own you'd be dead
You're winding yourself up until you're turning blue
Repeating everything that you read

So here we go with a letter, can you fix it for me?
Because we need entertainment to keep us all off the streets
So tonight you'll sleep softly in your beds

You could try anything and no one would know apart from you and me
You could stop anything, it starts with just one and turns to two then three
And it's only cause you came here with your brothers too
If you came here on your own you'd be dead
You'll raise a glass until you raise a fist or two
And get a shopping basket wrapped round your head

So here we go with a letter, can you fix it for me?
For twenty-four hours drinking to keep us all off the streets
So tonight you'll sleep softly in your beds

So this is the age of the train
All aboard for the labour exchange
My mind is running away with me
I'm a shop worn sales campaign
Trapped behind yellow cellophane
My mind is running away with

Everything I ever learned
Comes knocking at my head
What you thought was way too much is not enough

They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
What you make on the factory floor
You take straight to the company store
They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
'Til they can't break your will anymore
You are contractually tied to death's door

I never left the town I was made in
Whicker's World, I'm Michael Palin
My mind is running away with me
I record every one of my failings
By tying bread bags onto the railings
My mind is running away with
Everyone you ever loved
Comes knocking down your door
What you thought was way too much is not enough

They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
What you make on the factory floor
You take straight to the company store
They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
'Til they can't break your will anymore
You are contractually tied to death's door

Not enough, not enough
I want wider than this island
Not enough, not enough
I want brighter than a diamond
Everything you've ever known
Is in these city walls
What you thought was way too much, is not enough, it's not enough
And when you thought it's way too much it's not enough

They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
What you make on the factory floor
You take straight to the company store
They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
'Til they can't break your will anymore
You are contractually tied to death's doorEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I know cause I've seen it
It was great and I want it
There's no point in sitting
Going crazy on my own
Do you know what
I was put here in the world for
Could you tell me
In three words or more?

It's the only way of getting out of here
It's the only way of getting out of here

Take a lesson
From the ones who have been there
My brain is not damaged
But in need of some repair
Hold on to the basics
But we can't change all our tactics
There's no point sitting
Going crazy on your own
It's the only way of getting out of here
It's the only way of getting out of here

This is the modern way
Faking it everyday
Taking it as we come
We're not the only ones
Is that what we used to say
This is the modern way?

I know where I'm going
And that we are ever knowing
I will stop at nothing
Just to get what I want

It's the only way of getting out of here
It's the only way of getting out of here

Taking it as we come

Standing beside you

We're coming home

Light a fire
We're coming home
We'll write it down
We'll write it all down
And we're dancing on the finest line
Between the chance of the time of our lives
Wishing you were done
Oh no
Gotta run

And we're choosing not to make that choice
And we lose our shoes and voice
But we have alot of fun on the way
Wanna play?
Gotta come

Open, totally broken when you tumble through the dark
Hold me, hold me closer 'til you're breaking up don't leave
Fold it, fold it over eight times then start again

I was your world, I was okay
I was the light that shone on every day
I was your world, I was okay
I wasn't like that for you always

But if we've only got one parachute
If we've only got one parachute

Look alive
Pick a side
Draw a line in the sand
You're just the band

They treat us like we're extras in an epic
They treat us like we're mud on their boots
They leave us on the stretchers when the credits roll
Retreating safely to institutes
Where dinner party military forces
Toast themselves with the blood of us all
Smashing regimes between courses
Chanting "education, education, and war"

We're gonna need a lot more cannons
We're gonna need a lot more cannons
If you wanna be home by Christmas
If we're gonna be home by Christmas

I know there is another way
If you wanna see their face again
I know they feel the same way over there
They're making all the difficult decisions
Politicians and children first
Followed by their personal physicians who say
You will be happy if you expect the worse
Armed with paper straws and a bible
Lamps are going out across department stores
You will be issued with a rifle on arrival chaps
For education, education, and war

We're gonna need a lot more cannons
We're gonna need a lot more cannons
If you wanna be home by Christmas

Show us the way to go
Save our souls
Show us the way back home
Save our souls

Get behind the man in front

The Occupation
The Occupation
The occupation of Damnation Eternal
Decreed by Commander in Chief
Won by the infantry, led by the Colonel
Came at costs that would beggar belief
As they marched upon the inferno
And the inﬁdels dropped to their knees
Millions of civilians crammed in pavilions
Came to watch it on big screen TVs
The population of Damnation Eternal
Went from millions to thousands to one
The survivor then wrote in his journal
"Why on Earth did it take them so long?"
Within weeks we constructed a pipeline
Within years we'll have run the place dry
It'll just about last us our lifetime
So it's hip hip hoorays and high ﬁves
On the factory ﬂoor there's a whisper
We built cannons before it began
But the engines still pumping its piston
And the turbine still whirring its fan
The assembly line spits out the surplus
Into purpose built lead lined white vans
Rockets stockpile as ministry workers
Fill their pockets with all that they can
Secret meetings are held in the senate
What to do with this excess supply
There's a plan to abandon the planet
One V.I.P at a time
So we get up each day and have breakfast
Read the news and the weather forecast
As we sit and we open our letters
And we pray that it won't be our last2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I tell you what it's going to be like
I saw you on the bus and that was that
There's more to this than passing by
There's more to this than meets the eye
I tell you what it's going to be like
I saw you on the bus, I saw your shoes
They fell apart some time ago
I'll buy some more in five years
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing
I tell you what it's going to feel like
You lost a limb, and you can feel it itch
You leave, at night, not by my side
'Cause I'm not there to hold you too tightly
I tell you what it's going to be like
No, you can never hold my hand in public
They can't know or understand
That you and me are now together
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing
Oh, oh
You can have it all, if that's all right
And I will give it all to you 'cause you'd never fight me for it
You can have it all, if that's all right
And know that you can have it all
If it's all right, oh, oh, oh
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Ooh, ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah, la la
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah, la la
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing
Oh, oh
You can have it all, if that's all right
And I will give it all to you 'cause you'd never fight me for it
You can have it all, if that's all right
And I will give it all to you 'cause you'd never fight me for it
You can have it all, if that's all right
And I will give it all to you 'cause you'd never fight me for it
You can have it all, if that's all right
And know that you can have it all
If it's all right, oh, oh, oh2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If it's coming then we'll take it as it comes
And if it's going then we'll wave it goodbye
Waiting for a train that never comes
You're waiting for a brain that never knows

We break it down, into its parts
We toured around, and break our hearts
We laugh along with all of the jokes (Ha ha)
We raced along and stayed so close
Oh through it all (yeah)
We stay together
We stay together

I know that
My love got no other love
My love got no other love
She got
She got a lot
My love got no other love
My love got no other love
She got a home
And there's a light on that will never go out
And when the night's gone, not a shadow of a doubt
About you
About you
And there's a time bomb and it's gonna go off
Then we'll disarm it 'cos I'm so better off with you
Here with you, yeah
We break it down, into its parts
We risk it all through prison bars
We laid  it down, there to rest
And hold it down, until it's drowned
But more than that
We stay together
(We stay together)
We stay together
(We stay, we stay)
 x2

(We, we stay together)
(We, we stay together)
(We stay, we stay, we stay)
(We stay, we stay, we stay)
(We stay together)
(We stay, we stay)
(We stay, we stay)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Just wait
For happy ever after in a never ending summer, can't wait
Passing every mirror just to check you're looking slimmer, lost weight
99 problems, and every single one with a flake
How can you be so sad when everyone around you is okay?

Can't wait
Can't wait

Like ripping off a plaster: be quicker, do it faster, don't wait
Skippin' every meal, now can you feel it gathering pace?
Everyone is famous, line up and take a number, just wait
How can you be cryin' when everyone around you is...

Laughin' all the time, singin' as they go
Lookin' like an ad, drinkin' Diet Coke
Everybody dance, let's breakdown tonight
Making up the lies, keeping up the show
Checkin' out the boys, wearin' summer clothes
Get it while you can
Let's breakdown tonight
I'll just wait
Can't wait
Can't wait

Gimme, gimme, gimme celebrity bikini clickbait
Gimme Stacey Solomon, show me her abdominal plate
Where is my forever? I was promised I was special take take
How can it be normal when everyone around you is...

Laughin' all the time, singin' as they go
Lookin' like an ad, drinkin' Diet Coke
Everybody dance, come on over, let's breakdown tonight
Making up the lies, keeping up the show
Checkin' out the boys, wearin' summer clothes
Get it while you can
If you wanna, let's breakdown tonight

National Breakdown is starting today
Due to lack of interest, it's delayed
Now your 15 minutes turned into 8
I'll take hell now
Give em hell now and heaven can wait
Happy ever after in a never ending summer, just wait
How come you're so sad when almost everyone around is...

Laughin' all the time, singin' as they go
Lookin' like an ad, drinkin' Diet Coke
Everybody dance, come on over, let's breakdown tonight
Making up the lies, keeping up the show
Checkin' out the boys, wearin' summer clothes
Get it while you can
If you wanna, let's breakdown tonight
I'll just wait

Let's breakdown tonight, I'll just wait, wait, wait, wait
Let's breakdown tonight, I'll just wait, wait, wait, wait
Let's breakdown tonight, I'll just wait, wait, wait, wait
Let's breakdown tonight, I'll justEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
