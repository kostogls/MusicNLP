Happy New Year, first of all
I hope we have about a million, or two million more of them
If we can get over this summer; hehehe
I'd like to dedicate this one to, uh
The draggy scene that's going on
All the soldiers that are fighting in Chicago and Milwaukee and New York
Oh yes, and all the soldiers fighting in Vietnam
I'd like to do a thing called "Machine Gun"

Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart

Evil man make me kill you
Evil man make you kill me
Evil man make me kill you
Even though we're only families apart

Well I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer
You know what I mean?
Hey, and your bullets keep knocking me down
Hey, I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer now
Yeah, but you still blast me down, to the ground
The same way you shoot me down, baby
You'll be going just the same
Three times the pain
And your own self to blame
Hey, machine gun


I ain't afraid of your mess no more, babe
I ain't afraid no more
After awhile your, your cheap talk won't even cause me pain
So let your bullets fly like rain
Because I know all the time you're wrong baby
And you'll be going just the same

Yeah, machine gun
Tearing my family apart
Yeah, yeah, alright
Tearing my family apart

Don't you shoot him down
He's about to leave here
Don't you shoot him down
He's got to stay here
He ain't going nowhere
He's been shot down to the ground
Oh where he can't survive no, no
Yeah, that's what we don't want to hear anymore, alright
(No bullets)
At least here, huh huh
(No guns, no bombs)
Huh huh
No nothing, just let's all live and live
You know instead of killing20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me
Just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between
The moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she is going to come back tomorrow

And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm going to be by your side"

Sure enough this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel she said unto me
"Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you are going to be my man
You are going to rise"
And then she took me high over yonder

And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Forever I will be by your side"

Oh uh
I see fingers, hands, and shades of faces
Reaching up and not quite touching the promised land
I hear pleas, and prayers, and a desperate whisper saying:
"Oh Lord, please give us a helping hand"
Yeah, yeah

Way down in the background
I can see frustrated souls of cities burning
And all across the water vapor
I see weapons barking out the stamp of death
And up in the clouds I can imagine UFO's jumping themselves
Laughing they saying
Those people so uptight, they sure know how to make a mess

Back in the saloon my tears mix and mildew with my drink
I can't really tell my feet from the sawdust on the floor
But as far as I know
They may even try to wrap me up in cellophane and try and sell me
Brother sell me, and don't worry about looking at the storm

Lord, I feel the ocean swaying me
Washing away all my pain
See where I used to be wounded
Remember the scar?
Now you can't see a thing
And I don't feel no pain, no, no

Singing about the Valleys of Sunrise
Green and blue canyons, too
Singing about Atlantis love songs
The Valleys of Neptune is rising, rising, rising

Mercury liquid, emerald's shining
Now showing me where I came from, baby
Honey sun, turquoise bed he lays in
On the burning edge horizon
I'm sailing on a bluebird's mission
Bubbles and curls and tiptoes in the foam
See the wind make love to all the ocean
Tidal waves spread, and the message got home
And the message got home

Singing about the Valley of Sunsets...
Purple and gold... the Armies of the Lord
Before ancient Egypt, there were moon trips...
The Valleys of Neptune is arising -
Look out east coast, but you're going to have a neighbor
A rebirth land, home of the praying handsâ€‹
We know there were kinds, so much older
And they shall rise, and tell us much more the truth of man
I see visions of sleeping peaks erupting
Releasing all hell that will shake the Earth from end to end

And this isn't bad news, good news, or any news
It's just the truth, better save your souls while you can
Singing about the New Valleys
Of the Sunrise... Rainbow clean
The world is gonna be...
Singing about getting ready for the new tide...
The Valleys of Neptune is arisingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah, roll around
Thirty years they've been married
And now they're old and happy and they settle down
Settle down, yeah
Twenty years they've been married

You know they're having fun

So you, you say you wanna be married

Oh! Got to change
That was the good side, baby
Here comes the bad side
Ten years they've been married
A thousand kids run around hungry
'Cause their mother's a louse
Daddy's down at the whiskey house
That ain't all
For three years they've been married
They don't get along so good
They're tired of each other, you know how that goes
She got another lover, same old thing
So now you're seventeen
Running around, hanging out, and having your fun
Life for you has just begun, baby
And then you come saying
So you, you say you want to be married
Oh baby, trying to put me on a chain
Ain't that some shame?
You must be losing your, weak little mind
I ain't ready yet, baby, I ain't ready

Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things don't seem the same
Actin' funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky
Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm comin' up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me
Help me
Help me
Oh, no, no
Hammerin'
Talkin' 'bout heart 'n' s-soul

If everybody's still around, fluff and ease, if
So far out my mind
Something's happening, something's happening

"Hey, look out for my glass up there, man
That's my drink, man, that's my drink, alright
Make it a double, or eh
Somebody has to sing
Some body will sing?
Somebody will sing, right?
I don't know"
You all pass me that bottle
And I'll sing you all a real song
Yeah
Let me get my key, ahem
Well, I'm looking through Harlem
My stomach squeal just a little more
A stagecoach full of feathers and footprints
Pulls up to soap box door
Now a lady with a pearl handled necktie
Tied to the driver's fence
Breathes in my face
Bourbon and coke possessed words
"Haven't I seen you somewhere in hell
Or was it just an accident?"
(You know how I felt then, and so)
Before I could ask "Was it the East or West side?"
My feet they howled in pain
The wheels of a bandwagon cut very deep
But not as deep in my mind as the rain
And as they pulled away, I could see her words
Stagger and fall on my muddy tent
Well I picked them up, brushed them off
To see what they say
And you wouldn't believe
"Come around to my room, with the tooth in the middle
And bring along the bottle and a president"
And eh sometimes it's not so easy, baby
Especially when your only friend
Talks, sees, looks and feels like you
And you do just the same as him
(Gets very lonely up this road, baby)
(Yeah, hmmm, yeah)
(Got more to say)

Well I'm riding through LA (huh)
On a bicycle built for a fool
And I seen one of my old buddies
And he say, "You don't look the way you usually do"
I say, "Well, some people look like a coin-box"
He says, "Looks like you have got no coins to spare"
And I laid back and I thought to myself, and I said this
I just picked up my pride from underneath the pay phone
And combed this breath right out of my hair

And eh sometimes it's not so easy
Especially when your only friend
Talks, sees, looks and feels like you
And you do just the same as him
I just got out of a Scandinavian jail
And I'm on my way straight home to you
But I feel so dizzy, I take a quick look in the mirror
To make sure my friend's here with me too
And you know good well I don't drink coffee
So you fill my cup full of sand
And the frozen tea leaves on the bottom
Cherry lipstick around the broken edge
And my coat that you let your dog lay by the fire on
And your cat he attacks me from his pill-box ledge
And I thought you were my friend too
Man, my shadow comes in line before you

I'm finding out that it's not so easy, baby
Especially when your only friend
Talks, sees, looks and feels like you
And you do the same just like him

(Lord it's so lonely here, hmmm, yeah)
Yeah!
(Pass me that bottle over there)
Yeah, yeah, okay4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Shoot down some of those airplanes
Especially the ones that your flying too low

Come on back up with me
We've all been up through the night time baby
Now let's read the rays of reality

With the power of soul
Anything is possible

Anything you wanna do

Flying too much today
It's so groovy to float around sometimes
Even a jelly fish will tell you that
I said floatation is groovy
And he said
And a jelly fish will agree to that
Yeah, but that old jelly fish
Been floating around so long
Lord he hasn't got a bone in his jelly back
Floating every day and every night
Riding high is a risk
Sometimes the wind isn't right

Anything is possible
With the power of you
Anything you wanna do

Anything is possible
With the power of you
Anything you wanna do
