Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
By now, you shoulda somehow realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you
By now, you should've somehow realised what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (Saves me)

Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Slowly fade away

So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock 'n' roll band
Who'll throw it all away
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say


So, Sally can wait

Her soul slides away

So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, don't look back in anger

How many special people change?
How many lives are living strange?
Where were you while we were getting high?

Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?

Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky

Wake up the dawn and ask her why
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye

Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannonball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova

'Cause people believe
That they're gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning 'round, we don't know why
Why? Why? Why? Why?

Oh yeah

Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone?

Maybe I just wanna fly
Wanna live, I don't wanna die
Maybe I just wanna breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

I said maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone?
Maybe I will never be
All the things that I wanna be
Now is not the time to cry
Now's the time to find out why
I think you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

I need to be myself
I can't be no-one else
I'm feeling supersonic, give me gin and tonic
You can have it all, but how much do you want it?
You make me laugh
Give me your autograph
Can I ride with you in your BMW?
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine

You need to find out
'Cause no-one's gonna tell you what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you want to say
But before tomorrow

'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody can ever hear him call
Nobody can ever hear him call

You need to be yourself
You can't be no-one else
I know a girl called Elsa, she's into Alka-Seltzer
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train
And she makes me laugh
I got her autograph
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter
She's sniffing in a tissue selling the Big Issue
When she finds out
No-one's gonna tell her what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you want to say
But before tomorrow

'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody can ever hear him call
Nobody can ever hear him call16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday
I've got a lot of things to learn
Said I would and I'll be leaving one day
Before my heart starts to burn

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Times are hard when things have got no meaning
I've found a key upon the floor
Maybe you and I will not believe in
The things we find behind the door

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows
Yeah, nobody knows, the way it's gonna be
If you're leaving will you take me with you?
I'm tired of talking on my phone
There is one thing I can never give you
My heart will never be your home

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows
Yeah, nobody knows, the way it's gonna be

The way it's gonna be, yeah
Maybe I can see, yeah
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away (hey, hey)

Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be

Slide away and give it all you've got
My today fell in from the top
I dream of you and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now

Hold me down all the world's asleep
Need you now you've knocked me off my feet
I dream of you and we talk of growing old
But you said, "Please don't!"

Slide in baby, together we'll fly
I've tried praying but I don't know what you're saying to me

Now that you're mine
We'll find a way of chasing the Sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning we don't know what to do
Two of a kind
We'll find a way to do what we've done
Let me be the one who shines with you
And we can slide away
Slide away
Slide away

Slide away and give it all you've got

Slide in baby, together we'll fly

Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning we don't know what to do
We're two of a kind
We'll find a way to do what we've done

All your dreams are made
When you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade
Today's the day that all the world will see
Another sunny afternoon
Walking to the sound of my favorite tune
Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon

Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to rest your mind
You know you should so I guess you might as well

Yeah, we're on, haha

I would like to leave this city
This old town don't smell too pretty and
I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind
And when I leave this island
I'll book myself into a soul asylum
'Cause I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind

So here I go
I'm still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that were mine anyway
You're half the world away
Half the world away

Half the world away
I've been lost, I've been found but I don't feel down
And when I leave this planet
You know I'd stay but I just can't stand it and
I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind
And if I could leave this spirit
I'll find me a hole and I'll live in it and
I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind

Here I go
I'm still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that were mine anyway
You're half the world away
Half the world away

I've been lost, I've been found but I don't feel down

Some might say that sunshine follows thunder
Go and tell it to the man who cannot shine
Some might say that we should never ponder
On our thoughts today 'cause they hold sway over time

Some might say we will find a brighter day
Some might say we will find a brighter day

'Cause I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
You made no preparation
For my reputation once again
The sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain
It was overflowing gently
But it's all elementary my friend


Some might say they don't believe in heaven
Go and tell it to the man who lives in hell
Some might say you get what you've been given
If you don't get yours I won't get mine as well
Some might say we will find a brighter day
Some might say we will find a brighter day

'Cause I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
That made no preparation
For my reputation once again
The sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain
And my dog's been itching
Itching in the kitchen once again

Take the time to make some sense
Of what you want to say
And cast your words away upon the waves
Sail them home with acquiesce
On a ship of hope today
And as they land upon the shore
Tell them not to fear no more
Say it loud and sing it proud today
And then

Dance if you wanna dance
Please brother take a chance
You know they're gonna go
Which way they wanna go
All we know is that we don't know
How it's gonna be
Please brother let it be
Life on the other hand
Won't make us understand
We're all part of a masterplan
Say it loud and sing it proud today

I'm not saying right is wrong
It's up to us to make
The best of all the things that come our way
'Cause everything that's been has passed
The answer's in the looking glass
There's four and twenty million doors
On life's endless corridor
Say it loud and sing it proud
And they
Will dance if they wanna dance
Please brother take a chance
You know they're gonna go
Which way they wanna go
All we know is that we don't know
How it's gonna be
Please brother let it be
Life on the other hand
Won't make you understand
We're all part of a masterplan

She's in a family full of eccentrics
She's done things I never expected
And I need more time
She's got a sister
And God only knows how I've missed her
And on the palm of her hand is a blister
And I need more time

We don't get on with one another
But I quite fancy her mother
And I think that she likes me

In fact she's got 'bout a dozen
She's got one in the oven
But it's nothing to do with me

A cold and frosty morning there's not a lot to say
About the things caught in my mind
And as the day was dawning my plane flew away
With all the things caught in my mind

I do wanna be there when you're... coming down
I do wanna be there when you hit the ground

So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and today
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right

Damn, my situation, and the games I have to play
With all the things caught in my mind
Damn, my education, I can't find the words to say
With all the things caught in my mind
I do wanna be there when you're... coming down
And I do wanna be there when you hit the ground

So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and today
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time

The feelings that are wrong

Say that you'll stay

Sittin' on my own, chewin' on a bone
A thousand million miles from home
When something hit me
Somewhere right between the eyes
Sleepin' on a plane, you know you can't complain
You took your last chance once again
I landed, stranded
Hardly even knew your name

I wanna talk tonight
Until the morning light
'Bout how you saved my life
You and me see how we are
You and me see how we are

All your dreams are made of strawberry lemonade
And you make sure I eat today
You take me walking
To where you played when you were young
I'll never say that I won't ever make you cry
And this I'll say, I don't know why
I know I'm leavin'
But I'll be back another day

Is it my imagination
Or have I finally found something worth living for?
I was looking for some action
But all I found was cigarettes and alcohol

You could wait for a lifetime
To spend your days in the sunshine
You might as well do the white line
'Cause when it comes on top
You gotta make it happen
You gotta make it happen
You gotta make it happen
You gotta make it happen

Is it worth the aggravation
To find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for?
It's a crazy situation
But all I need are cigarettes and alcohol

You could wait for a lifetime
To spend your days in the sunshine
You might as well do the white line
'Cause when it comes on top

The fool on the hill and I feel fine

Look into the wall of my mind's eye
I think I know, but I don't know why
The questions are the answers you might need
Coming in a mess, going out in style
I ain't good looking but I'm someone's child
No-one can give me the air that's mine to breathe

I met my maker, I made him cry
And on my shoulder he asked me why
His people won't fly through the storm
I said "Hey, listen up man, they don't even know you're born"

All my people right here, right now
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)
All my people right here, right now
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)
All my people right here, right now
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't really care for what you believe
So open up your fist or you won't receive
The thoughts and the words of every man you'll need
So get up off the floor and believe in life
No-ones ever gonna ever ask you twice
Get on the bus and bring it on home to me

I met my maker I made him cry (yes you did)
And on my shoulder he asked me why
His people won't fly through the storm
I said "Listen up man, they don't even know you're born"

All my people right here, right now
They know what I mean (yeah, yeah)
All my people right here, right now
They know what I mean (yeah, yeah)
All my people right here, right now
They know what I mean (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All my people right here, right now
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)
All my people right here, right now
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)
All my people right here, right now
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
