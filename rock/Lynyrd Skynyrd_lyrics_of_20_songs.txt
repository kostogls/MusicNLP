Turn it up

Big wheels keep on turnin'
Carry me home to see my kin
Singin' songs about the southland
I miss Alabamy once again
And I think it's a sin, yes

Well I heard Mr Young sing about her (Southern man)
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around, anyhow

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

In Birmingham they love the governor (Boo! Boo! Boo!)
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you?
Tell the truth
Sweet home Alabama

Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
Here I come, Alabama


(Ah-ah-ah, Alabama

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two (Yes, they do)
Lord, they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue
Now how 'bout you?

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
Sweet home Alabama (Oh, sweet home, baby)
Where the skies are so blue (And the governor's true)
Sweet home Alabama (Lordy)

If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be traveling on, now
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see

But if I stay here with you, girl

And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Bye, bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah yeah
Though this feeling I can't change

'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame
But, if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same

Mama told me when I was young
"Come sit beside me, my only son
And listen closely to what I say
And if you do this, it'll help you some sunny day, ah yeah"

(Be a simple man)

Oh, take your time, don't live too fast
Troubles will come and they will pass
You'll find a woman, yeah, and you'll find love
And don't forget, son, there is someone up above

And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby, be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can?

Forget your lust for the rich man's gold
All that you need is in your soul

All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied

I was cutting the rug down at a place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you-know-who
He said, "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow
What you trying to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you"
I said, "Excuse me"

I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shaking like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, and mean, and
Big and bad, Lord, a-pointing that gun at me
"Oh wait a minute, mister, I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble with you
And I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you"

"Oh won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see-a me no more
For sure"

Well the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you, son, well, it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well he turned and there screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door

"Oh won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see-a me no more
Show me the back door"3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well I used to wake the mornin'
Before the rooster crowed
Searchin' for soda bottles
To get myself some dough
Brought 'em down to the corner
Down to the country store
Cash 'em in and give my money
To a man named Curtis Loew

Old Curt was a black man
With white, curly hair
When he had a fifth of wine
He did not have a care
He used to own an old dobro
Used to play it 'cross his knee
I'd give old Curt my money
He'd play all day for me

Play me a song
Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well I got your drinkin' money
Tune up your dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
To ever play the blues
He looked to be sixty
And maybe I was ten
Mama used to whoop me
But I'd go see him again
I'd clap my hands, stomp my feets
Try to stay in time
He'd play me a song or two
Then take another drink of wine

Play me a song
Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well I got your drinkin' money
Tune up your dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
To ever play the blues
Yes, sir


On the day old Curtis died
Nobody came to pray
Ol' preacher said some words
And they chucked him in the clay
Well he lived a lifetime
Playin' the black man's blues
And on the day he lost his life
That's all he had to lose
Play me a song
Curtis Loew, hey Curtis Loew
I wish that you was here
So everyone would know
People said he was useless
Them people all are fools
'Cause Curtis you're the finest picker
To ever play the blues3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money

They're gonna take me out to California gonna make me a superstar
Just pay me all my money, mister, maybe you won't get a scar

Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' For MCA

Life is so strange when it's changing, yes indeed
Well I've seen the hard times and the pressure's been on me
But I keep on working like the working man do
And I've got my act together, going to walk all over you

Gimme back my bullets
Put 'em back where they belong
Ain't fooling around cause I done had my fun
Ain't gonna see no more damage done
Gimme back my bullets

Sweet talking people done ran me out of town
And I drank enough whiskey to float a battleship around
But I'm leaving this game one step ahead of you
And you will not hear me cry because I do not sing the blues


Been up and down since I turned seventeen
Well I've been on top, and then it seems I lost my dream
But I got it back, I'm feeling better everyday
Tell all those pencil pushers, better get out of my way

Two feets, they come a creepin'
Like a black cat do
And two bodies are layin' naked
A creeper think he got nothin' to lose

So he creeps into this house, yeah
And unlocks the door
An' as the man's reaching for his trousers
He shoots him full of 38 holes

Mister Saturday Night Special
Got a barrel that's blue and cold
It ain't good for nothing but puttin' men six feet in a hole

Big Jim's been drinking whiskey
And playing poker on a losing night
An' pretty soon, Ol' Jim starts a-thinkin'
Somebody been cheatin' and lyin'
So Big Jim commence to fighting
I wouldn't tell you no lie
Big Jim done pulled his pistol
Shot his friend right between the eyes

Got a barrel that's blue and cold
It ain't good for nothing but puttin' men six feet in a hole

Hmm, and that's the Saturday Night Special
For twenty dollars, you can buy yourself one, too
Here it come

Oh, lemme tell you all about it

Hand guns are made for killing
They ain't no good for nothing else
And if you like to drink your whiskey
You might even shoot yourself

So why don't we dump 'em, people, to the bottom of the sea?
Before some old fool come around here
Wanna shoot either you, or me
Mister Saturday Night Special
You got a barrel that's blue and cold
You ain't good for nothing but puttin' men six feet in a hole

It's a Saturday Night Special
And I'd like to tell you what you can do with it, too

There ain't no place I ain't never gone
But its kind of like the saying that you heard so many times
Well there just ain't no place like home
Did you ever see a she-gator protect her young
Or a fish in a river swimming free
Did you ever see the beauty of the hills of Carolina
Or the sweetness of the grass in Tennessee

And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes

Do you like to see a mountain stream a-flowing
Do you like to see a youngun with his dog
Did you ever stop to think about, well, the air your breathing
Well you better listen to my song

All I can do is write 'em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes

Talking 'bout his brand new mission
Liked his plans, but they came undone when he got around with God and guns
I don't know how he grew up
But it sure wasn't down at the hunting club
Cause if it was he'd understand a little bit more about the working man

God and guns
Keep us strong

Was founded on

If we let them take our God and guns
