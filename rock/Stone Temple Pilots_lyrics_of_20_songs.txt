And I feel that time's a wasted go
So where ya goin' 'til tomorrow?
And I see that these are lies to come
So would you even care?

And I feel it
And I feel it

Where ya goin' for tomorrow?
Where ya goin' with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

And I feel, so much depends on the weather
So is it rainin' in your bedroom?
And I see, that these are the eyes of disarray
So would you even care?

And I feel it
And she feels it
Where ya goin' for tomorrow?
Where ya goin' with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it

Where ya goin' for tomorrow?

Forward yesterday
Makes me wanna stay
What they said was real
Makes me wanna steal
Living under house
Guess I'm living, I'm a mouse
Alls I gots is time
Got no meaning, just a rhyme

Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be, half the man I used to be
Feeling uninspired
Think I'll start a fire
Everybody run
Bobby's got a gun
Think you're kinda neat
Then she tells me I'm a creep
Friends don't mean a thing
Guess I'll leave it up to me

Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
Guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be, half the man I used to be
(Half the man)
(Hey-yeah!)

Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
Guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be

Waiting on a Sunday afternoon
For what I've read between the lines
Your lies
Feeling like a hand in rusted shame
So do you laugh or does it cry
Reply?

Leaving on a Southern train
Only yesterday you lied
Promises of what I seemed to be
Only watched the time go by
All of these things you said to me

Breathing is the hardest thing to do
With all I've said and all that's dead for
You
You lied
Goodbye

Leaving on a Southern train
Only yesterday you lied
Promises of what I seemed to be
Only watched the time go by
All of these things I said to you20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Driving faster in my car
Falling farther from just what we are
Smoke a cigarette and lie some more
These conversations kill
Falling faster in my car

Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today, no conversation
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long
To wait too long, to wait too long

Too much walking, shoes worn thin
Too much tripping and my soul's worn thin
Time to catch a ride it leaves today
Her name is what it means
Too much walking, shoes worn thin

Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today, no conversation
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long
To wait too long
To wait too long

Don't cut out my paper heart
I ain't dying anyway
Take a look at Eiffel towers
Never trust them dirty liars
Sipping lemon yellow booze
Old lead-belly sings the blues
All dressed up on wedding day
Keep on tripping anyway

I am, I am, I said I'm not myself
But I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
So keep your bankroll lottery
Eat your salad day, deathbed motorcade

Fake the heat and scratch the itch
Skinned up knees and salty lips
I'll breathe your life, Vicks vapor life
And when you binge, I purge alike, let go
It's harder holding on
One more trip and I'll be gone
So keep your head up, keep it on
Just a whisper, I'll be gone
Take a breath and make it big
It's the last you'll ever get
Break your neck with diamond noose
It's the last you'll ever choose
I am, I am I said I'm not myself
But I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
Hold me closer, closer, Let me go
Let me be, just let me be

I am, I am, I said I'm not myself
But I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
So keep your bankroll lottery
Eat your salad day, deathbed motorcade

One time a thing occurred to me
What's real and what's for sale?
Blew a kiss and tried to take it home

Isn't you, isn't me
Search for things that you can't see
Going blind, out of reach
Somewhere in the vasoline

Two times and it has rendered me
Punch drunk and without bail
Think I'd be safer all alone

Flies in the vasoline we are
Sometimes it blows my mind
Keep getting stuck here all the time

Isn't you, isn't me
Search for things that you can't see
Going blind, out of reach
Somewhere in the vasoline
You'll see the look and you'll see the lies
You'll eat the lies and you will


Flies in the vasoline we are
Sometimes it blows my mind
Keep getting stuck here all the time

Isn't you, isn't me

Can you see like a child?
Can you see what I want?
I wanna run through your wicked garden
Heard that's the place to find you
'Cause I'm alive, so alive now
I know the darkness blinds you

Can you see without eyes?
Can you speak without lies?
I wanna drink from your naked fountain
I can drown your sorrows
I'm gonna burn, burn you to life now
Out of the chains that bind you

Can you see just like a child?
Can you see just what I want?
Can I bring you back to life?
Are you scared of life?

Burn, burn, burn
Burn your wicked garden down
Burn, burn, burn
Burn your wicked garden to the ground
Can you feel pain inside?
Can you love? Can you cry?
I wanna run through your wicked garden
Heard that's the place to find you
'Cause I'm alive, so alive now
Out of the dark that blinds you

Can you see just like a child?

Our bed we live, our bed we sleep
Making love and I become you
Flesh is warm with naked feet
Stabbing thorns and you become me

Oh, I'd beg for you
Oh, you know I'll beg for you

Pick a song and sing a yellow nectarine
Take a bath, I'll drink the water that you leave
If you should die before me
Ask if you can bring a friend
Pick a flower, hold your breath
And drift away

She holds my hand, we share a laugh
Slipping orange blossom breezes
Love is still and sweat remains
A cherished gift, unselfish feeling

Oh, I'd beg for you
Oh, you know I'll beg for you
Pick a song and sing a yellow nectarine
Take a bath, I'll drink the water that you leave
If you should die before me
Ask if you can bring a friend
Pick a flower, hold your breath
And drift away

She tells me things, I listen well
Drink the wine and save the water
Skin is smooth, I steal a glance
Dragon flies are gliding over

Oh, I'd beg for you
Oh, you know I'll beg for you

Take a bath, I'll drink the water that you leave

Find you in the dark
Read you like a cheap surprise
Without shame
Sell me out, and frame your name

I can hear when the pig whispers sweetly
Jealousy is the weapon you kill me
Keep a dime for a truth you might tell

You towed the line, and I know it was mine
Couldn't hide, write a wave, ride a lie
Let me know, can I, friend, ask you why?

Rolling back the days
With my friend I love to play
The "little one"
Superman with silver gun

I can hear when the pig whispers sweetly
Jealousy is the weapon you kill me
Keep a dime for a truth you might tell
You towed the line, and I know it was mine
Couldn't hide, write a wave, ride a lie

Take a piece of my life

I got a picture of a photograph
Of a wedding in a shell
It's just a burning ancient memory
I never kiss and tell

So turn it up and burn it
There's a hole in your head
There's a hole in your head
(Where the birds can't sing along)

Does anybody know how the story really goes?
How the story really goes
Or do we all just hum along

Sell your soul and sign an autograph
Big bang baby, it's a crash, crash, crash
I wanna cry, but I gotta laugh
Orange crush mama is a laugh, laugh, laugh

Spin me up, spin me, spin me out
Station to station send me up and out
Is this what life and love is all about?
I think I think so
We used to see in color
Now it's only black and white
Yeah, it's only black and white
('Cause the world is color blind)

She lives in a bungalow
She kills me with rose-garden thorns
She waits for me
My love is unusual
It's painted with roses and thorns
With her I'm complete

She lives by the wall
And waits by the door
She walks in the sun
To me

Visions of Mexico seduce me
It goes to my head so carefully
Memories of candles and incense
And all of these things remember these

She lives by the wall
And waits by the door
She walks in the sun
To me
She comforts me when
The candles blow out
The cake has grown mold
But the memories are sweet
The laughter's all gone
But the memories are mine
The Mexican princess
Is out of my life

She lives by the wall
And waits by the door
She walks in the sun
