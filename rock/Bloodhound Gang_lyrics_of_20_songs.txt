Ha-Ha! Well now, we call this the act of mating
But there are several other very important differences
Between human beings and animals that you should know about
(I'd appreciate your input)

Sweat baby, sweat baby, sex is a Texas drought
Me and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts
Yes, I'm Siskel, yes, I'm Ebert and you're getting two thumbs up
You've had enough of two-hand touch, you want it rough, you're out of bounds
I want you smothered, want you covered, like my Waffle House hash browns
Come quicker than FedEx, never reach an apex, just like Coca-Cola stock, you are inclined
To make me rise an hour early, just like Daylight Savings Time

Do it now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it again now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Getting horny now

Love, the kind you clean up with a mop and bucket
Like the lost catacombs of Egypt, only God knows where we stuck it
Hieroglyphics, let me be Pacific: I wanna be down in your South Seas
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean means "Small Craft Advisory"
So, if I capsize on your thighs high tide, B-5, you sunk my battleship
Please turn me on, I'm Mister Coffee with an automatic drip
So show me yours, I'll show you mine, "Tool Time," you'll Lovett just like Lyle
And then we'll do it doggy style so we can both watch "X-Files"

Do it now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it again now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Getting horny now


You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it again now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel

Fish don't fry in the kitchen

Vulcanize the whoopee stick in the ham wallet
Cattle prod the oyster ditch with the lap rocket
Batter dip the cranny ax in the gut locker
Retrofit the pudding hatch, ooh, la, la – with the boink swatter

If I get you in the loop when I
Make a point to be straight with you then
In lieu of the innuendo in the end know my intent though
I Brazilian wax poetic so hypothetically
I don't wanna beat around the bush

Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo
Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo

Marinate the nether rod in the squish mitten
Power drill the yippee bog with the dude piston
Pressure wash the quiver bone in the fish wrinkle
Cannonball the fiddle cove, ooh, la, la – with the pork steeple
If I get you in the loop when I make a point to be straight with you then
In lieu of the innuendo in the end know my intent though

Hello, my name is Jimmy Pop and I'm a dumb white guy
I'm not old or new, but middle school, fifth grade, like junior high
I don't know mofo', if y'all peeps be bugging, givin' props to my ho, 'cause she fly
But I can take the heat, 'cause I'm the other white meat known as 'Kid Funky Fried'
Yeah, I'm hung like planet Pluto, hard to see with the naked eye
But if I crashed into Uranus, I would stick it where the sun don't
Shine
'Cause I'm kind of like Han Solo, always stroking my own Wookiee
I'm the root of all that's evil, yeah, but you can call me Cookie
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let the motherfucker burn
Burn, motherfucker, burn
Yo, yo, this hardcore ghetto gangster image takes a lot of practice
I'm not black, like Barry White, no, I am white, like Frank Black is
So, if man is five and the devil is six, then that must make me seven
This honkey's gone to Heaven
But if I go to hell, well then, I hope I burn well
I'll spend my days with JFK, Marvin Gaye, Martha Raye, and Lawrence Welk
And Kurt Cobain, Kojak, Mark Twain and Jimi Hendrix's poltergeist
And Webster, yeah, Emmanuel Lewis, 'cause he's the Antichrist
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire

Tried to O.D. on the Cold-Eeze
Golden Girls got me sweatin' to the oldies
Hanging out like double-Ds, sip Long Island Iced Teas
Wrote to Mayor McCheese, "Send a Shamrock Shake, please!"
Three o' clock on the dot, time to cruise for eighth graders
Rather tape the Weather Channel so that I can watch it later
Reruns of Rerun! So, what's happening?
Dee's knocked up and Rog's on crack again
Deepthroat a whole Nutty Buddy
Make whoopie to a batch of Silly Putty
Made a Spam and Colgate sandwich and ate it
Go through National Geographic and draw panties on the natives
So I like to dance naked in front of my pets
But my cat was inattentive, so I sent him UPS
Playing spin the bottle with my mom
I watch COPS with no pants on
Must've blown a fuse, nothing's going on
Lamer than the Pope, climb the walls like King Kong
Buggin' out like Tori Spelling's eyes
Deader than the parents on A Party of Five
Luciano Pavarotti on a treadmill
Not going nowhere, slim chance we will
Less hip than Bo Jackson, bored like wood
Dick around like Frankie Goes to Hollywood

Relax, don't do it, when you wanna go to it
Relax, don't do it, when you wanna cum
Relax, don't do it, when you wanna go to it
Relax, don't do it, when you wanna cum

Nowhere to go, I can't wake up late
Just sit around and wait for my Old Spice to activate
Stalemate jail-bait in my so-called-life imprisonment
Amazing what a good breakfast pickles make, isn't it?
I like to pretend I'm speed reading
Never lose the sight of the thrill of sneezing
Don't need a shower today, just some Brut by Faberge
Smell the ass of my jeans--clean, they'll do another day
And I recycle; I sniff my own farts
I dial the wrong number, hope a conversation starts
I mean, I might as well be listening to Journey
Givin' myself a mullet, hook the Flowbee to the Kirby
Make a prank call pretending I'm a mime
Get stuck in traffic just to pass the time
Sent a letter in the mail, in Braille, to Jonny Quest
"Send me back my Etch-A-Sketch!"
Must've blown a fuse, nothing's going on
Lamer than the Pope, climb the walls like King Kong
Buggin' out like Tori Spelling's eyes
Deader than the parents on A Party of Five
Luciano Pavarotti on a treadmill
Not going nowhere, slim chance we will
Less hip than Bo Jackson, bored like wood
Dick around like Frankie Goes To Hollywood

Relax, don't do it, when you wanna go to it
Relax, don't do it, when you wanna cum
Relax, don't do it, when you wanna go to it

I'm mighty tighty whitey and I'm smugglin' plums
When you wanna cum

When you wanna cum
I'm mighty tighty whitey and I'm smugglin' plums
When you wanna cum

Fuck Guns 'N' Roses without Slash
A real man never uses hair product unless he's black
Toilet Paper is for queers
Gargling after a blowjob is how they make light beer

You can't have no fun with an unloaded gun
My Dad says that's for pussies

Ain't gonna lift the seat to whizz
Just 'cos it's called Men's Gymnastics doesn't mean it is
This Fairtrade coffee tastes like gay
Now seems like a good time to out Matthew McConaughey

You can't have no fun with an unloaded gun
My Dad says that's for pussies

Libraries, back-up parachutes and the Versailles Treaty
Seatbelts, hurricane warnings and anti-freeze
Rogaine, helmets, CPR and Kenny G
Wheelchairs, Ghandi, rehab, braille and harmonies
John Wayne would never use a surge protector!

You can't have no fun with an unloaded gun
My Dad says that's for pussies
You can't have no fun with an unloaded gun

You can't have no fun with an unloaded gun

I was lonelier than Kunta Kinte at a Merle Haggard concert that night I strolled on into Uncle Limpy's Hump Palace lookin' for love. It had been a while
In fact, three hundred and sixty-five had come and went since that midnight run haulin' hog to Shakey Town on I-10. I had picked up this hitchhiker that was sweatin' gallons through a pair of Daisy-Duke cut-offs and one of those Fruit of the Loom tank-tops
Well, that night I lost myself to ruby red lips, milky white skin and baby blue eyes. Name was Russell

Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'
Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'
Well, I find it's quite a thrill
When she grinds me against her will
Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'

Well, faster than you can say "shallow grave", this pretty little thing come up to me and starts kneadin' my balls like hard-boiled eggs in a tube sock. Said her name was Bambi and I said, "Well that's a coincidence darlin', 'cause I was just thinkin' about skinnin' you like a deer."
Well, she smiled, had about as much teeth as a Jack-O-Lantern, and I went on to tell her how I would wear her face like a mask as I do my little kooky dance. And then she told me to shush. I guess she could sense my desperation
'Course, it's hard to hide a hard-on when you're dressed like Minnie Pearl

Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'
Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'
Well, I find it's quite a thrill
When she grinds me against her will
Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'

So, Bambi's goin' on about how she can make all my fantasies come true. So I says, "Even this one I have where Jesus Christ is jackhammering Mickey Mouse in the doo-doo hole with a lawn dart as Garth Brooks gives birth to something resembling a cheddar cheese log with almonds on Santa Claus's tummy-tum?"
Well, ten beers, twenty minutes and thirty dollars later, I'm parkin' the beef bus in tuna town if you know what I mean. Got to nail her back at her trailer. Heh. That rhymes
I have to admit it was even more of a turn-on when I found out she was doin' me to buy baby formula
Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'
Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'
Well, I find it's quite a thrill
When she grinds me against her will
Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'

Day or so had passed when I popped the clutch, gave the tranny a spin and slid on into the Stinky Pinky Gulp N' Guzzle Big Rig Snooze-A-Stop. There I was browsin' through the latest issue of Throb when I saw Bambi starin' at me from the back of a milk carton. Well, my heart just dropped
So, I decided to do what any good Christian would:
You can not imagine how difficult it is to hold a half gallon of moo juice and polish the one-eyed gopher when you're doin' seventy-five in an eighteen-wheeler. I never thought missing children could be so sexy
Did I say that out loud?

Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'
Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'
Well, I find it's quite a thrill
When she grinds me against her will

Dog will hunt, I'm the front-end loader
Travoltin' over, so try my slam on for size
Drive stick with that kung-fu grip
Let the banana split and watch it go right to your thighs
Cop a feel, Copperfield style
Abracadabra that bra, do you think I can pull it off?
Wanna bang around? Just jot me down on your to-do list
Under "put out like a fire", 'cause

When you're tick-tockin' them?
Serious Levis? So tight, can't be classified
That's why I'm here to fill that opening
Make a seasoned pass to mount that ass
And bob hope that I might one night stand a chance
Let's go feng shui the fuck around my digs like a superball
Bring that sunny side up, and
I got somethin' and it goes thumpin' like this

My last girlfriend didn't like me, thought she might be
Most likely a dyke, she just didn't excite me
Lefty? Yeah, but that was alright
She was hotter than the sun but she just wasn't that bright
My mistake, she was more flaky than a leper colony
I think a wooden clothespin would have been much better company
Ass like a donkey acting funky, gave her "L" now she's a flunky
So my love for her died quicker than a batch of Sea Monkeys,
Early bird gets the worm, spread your legs or spread the word
So what if I'm not the smartest peanut in the turd?
I'm white, which goes with everything but I can come in any color
And I'm looking for the kind of girl that reminds me of my mother
But it's hard to find a girl with a viper tattooed on her tushy
And how many girls do you know that can play the harmonica with their pussy?
Like 'em easy, hot and sweet like a Rice Krispie Treat, gee
You know what I really want in a girl? Me

I need to find a new vagina
Any kind of new vagina
It's hard to rhyme a word like vagina
Calvin Klein, kind of, North Carolina

Women are like dog doo, hear me through, don't interrupt
It's just the older that they are, the easier they get to pick-up
I'd fill the generation gap, clean the cobwebs from her rafters
Old hens would rather put out than be put out to the pasture
No, age just ain't a gauge, I like my girls like my cheese
Preferably for me, fat-free American singles only
I want my next chick anorexic, the winner is the thinner
Won't have to take her skinny ass out to a fancy dinner
Like Sizzler, she got a beef? We'll chew the fat
If I forget to put the seat up, I can put up with her crap
Let her lash out and crack the whip, but not in bed, I don't play rough
No, I can't be tied down with a girl that wants me tied up
Just independent like NOFX, smart like Janeane Garafolo
She'd use big words to make fun of me so that I would never know
Bestow upon me all her wisdom of the Dewey Decimal System, gee
You know what I really want in a girl? Me
I need to find a new vagina
Any kind of new vagina
It's hard to rhyme a word like vagina
Kevin Kline, kind of, South Carolina

You must die! I alone am best!

I hope ya flip some guy the bird
He cuts you off and you're forced to swerve
In front of the Beatles' tour bus
A Bookmobile and a Mack truck
Hauling hazardous biological waste
The light turns red you have no brakes
And Hard Copy gets it all on tape
So you can see the look on your face

... Die Die Die Die Die Die Die
... Die Die Die Die Die Die Die

I hope your Pinto begins to spin
Takes out a disabled Vietnam Veteran
Mows down a Nobel Peace Prize Winner
And maybe some orphans having Christmas dinner
Perhaps even the British Royal Family
And the Rabbi that's clutching the bottle-fed puppy
And we can't forget the newlyweds
And those Jerry's Kids are as good as dead
I hope this helps to emphasize
I hope this helps to clarify
I hope you die

I hope your cellmate thinks he's God
But C.N.N. refer to him as "Bowling Ball Bag Bob"
Serving time again for abuse of a corpse
Only this time the victim's a Clydesdale horse
While he masturbates to photos of livestock
He does the "Silence of the Lambs" dance to Christian Rock
Eats feces and quotes from Deliverance,
And fights with his imaginary playmate Vince

... Die Die Die Die Die Die Die
... Die Die Die Die Die Die Die

I hope he grins like Jack Nicholson
And forces you to play a game called Balls On Chin
And whatever happens next is all a blur
But you remember "fist" can be a verb
And when you finally regain consciousness
You're bound and gagged in a wedding dress
And the prison guard looks the other way
'Cause he's the guy ya flipped the bird the other day
I hope this helps to emphasize
I hope this helps to clarify
I hope you die

... I hope you die!2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely
Someone calls on me
And every now and then I spend my time at rhyme and verse
And curse those faults in me

And then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
Then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
And does she want to give me kicks and be my steady chick
And give me pick of memories
Or maybe rather gather tales from all the fails and tribulations
No one ever sees
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
Sweet as the punch

When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks whose sickness
Is the games they play
And when the masquerade is played the neighbor folks make jokes
At who is most to blame today

And then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
Then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
And does she want to set them free, and let them see reality
From where she got her name
And will they struggle much, when told that such a tender touch of hers
Will make them not the same
And when the morning of the warning's passed the gassed and flaccid kids
Are flung across - the stars
The psychodramas and the traumas gone the songs are left unsung
And hung upon - the scars

And then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
Then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
And does she want to see the stains, the dead remains of all the pains
She left the night before
Or will their waking eyes, reflect the lies, and make them realize
Their urgent cry for sight no more

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
Sweet as the punch2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The morn that I was born my old man beat up the doctor
He clocked the doctor cause the doctor said I looked like Chewbacca
The doctor said, "Sir, you're misled, sir, which infers you mistook me
I did not mean your lovely wife was shacking up with a wookie
What I mean is Wolverine is less hairy than your son
He looks like Chewie (Baba Booey Baba Booey)
And a Hong Kong Phooey all in one
To put it mild your new-born child's completely nutty fu-fu looking
I'd shove him back into the oven until he is done cooking."

But why's everybody always pickin' on me?
Cause my fifteen year-old cousin has less acne
But why's everybody always pickin' on me?
Ain't brushed them teeth since 1983
But why's everybody always pickin' on me?
Cause you got the grooming habits of a chimpanzee
But why's everybody always pickin' on me?
Cause you're white but you got a nose like Bill Cosby

Why's everybody always pickin' on me?
Always pickin' and rippin' apart poor ol' Jimmy Pop Ali
I got a schnoz like the Cos' but there's a lot more wrong with you
So back me up Bill (Yeah, and you're ugly too!)
So what if I brush my teeth with a piece of cheddar cheese
Or wear a fish net shirt by Chams with my Sergio Valentia jeans
And my mirror never lies but it always verifies
I got more cheese and pepperoni than a homemade pizza pie
You compare me to a Mon chichi but I don't understand
Why I'm scorned like I'm deformed like the Elephant Man
And yea I took my mom to the prom but hey she asked me first
But at least this time I didn't find my date in the back of a hearse
About as popular with the girls with Englebert Humperdink
And that might be cause everybody calls me Shrinky Dink
I know I'm known as Polaroid I'm not a total retard
It's cause I'm done in sixty seconds and you'll still want it enlarged
But why's everybody always pickin' on me?
Cause you wore velour flares until the late Eighties
But why's everybody always pickin' on me?
Cause you run like a girl and sit down to pee
But why's everybody always pickin' on me?
Cause your only school chum was the lunch lady
But why's everybody always pickin' on me?
You took your mom to the prom but still got lucky

Like that episode where Gilligan gets sick of being teased
And he breaks into the professor's lab and makes some LSD
Peaks, freaks, and eats the skipper's brains then beats ginger with coconuts
As Mr. Howell and Lovey burn alive inside of their grass hut
Oh, he'll kill again, that Gilligan, they he should of let him be
And like a postal clerk I'll go berserk if you don't stop teasing me
See the trick is only pick on those that can't do you no harm
Like the drummer from Def Leppard's only got one arm
The drummer from Def Leppard's only got one arm
The drummer from Def Leppard's only got one arm
The drummer from Def Leppard's only got one arm
The drummer from Def Leppard's only got one arm

Ain't brushed them teeth since 1983
But why's everybody always pickin' on me?
Cause you got the grooming habits of a chimpanzee
But why's everybody always pickin' on me?
Cause you're white but you got a nose like Bill Cosby
But why's everybody always pickin' on me?
Cause ya wore velour flares until the late Eighties
But why's everybody always pickin' on me?
Cause you run like a girl and you sit down to pee
But why's everybody always pickin' on me?
Cause your only school chum was the lunch lady
But why's everybody always pickin' on me?
Cause no one likes you monkey boy3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Where to begin? They call me tropical storm Jim
Here's your really local forecast, there's a warm front moving in
Pin drop, yeah you heard it when I moon walked in the room
While around the water cooler at the Legion of Doom
They're shouting "Why's the new guy with the sweet moves talking that smack?"
Well I'm the kind of crazy made from the shit of a bat
I swing like hell but know full well that I won't win the fight
But big man I'm the beta male that's gonna ruin your night

My rhymes score dimes ain't nothing you can do
It's hard to clap with your dick in your hand dude
I write the songs that girls like to dance to
I write the songs that girls like to dance to

I write the songs that girls like to dance to
I write the songs that girls like to dance to

What? Who me? Who am I? Well I'm just awesome
Like watching someone else getting kicked in the balls
And DJs hit pause when I waltz in, my thoughts enthrall crowds for hours
And it would come as no surprise if I had magical powers, poof
Buy me beers, cheers, here's to blood, sweat and Tears for Fears
Yes I get stupid like a baby with pierced ears
So drop me like them panties drop when I drop knowledge
Danger was my middle name but I changed it in college
My rhymes score dimes ain't nothing you can do
It's hard to clap with your dick in your hand dude
I write the songs that girls like to dance to
I write the songs that girls like to dance to
My rhymes score dimes ain't nothing you can do
It's hard to clap with your dick in your hand dude
I write the songs that girls like to dance to
I write the songs that girls like to dance to

I'm going to Africa
Yes ma'am I'm a brick
Was President Lincoln okay? Mittens?
There's a dog in the vent
Chicken necks?
I pick Ken Griffey Jr
I fell out 2 times
I'm pedaling backwards
This snowflake tastes like fish sticks
We're a totem pole
Dying tickles
I heard a Frankenstein lives there
She's touching my special area
Go banana

Ralphie (Ralphie)
Get off (get off)
The stage (the stage)
Sweetheart (sweetheart)
Oh say can you rock?
I'm a pop sensation
I'm a pop sensation
Salmon gutter
I'm Idaho
You smell like dead bunnies
That's where I saw the leprechaun
Fun toys are fun
Chocolate microscopes
You're not it
That is so 1991
I bit my tongue

Raise your hand if you like American bitches
Locked in girl on girl kisses
Well, I do
You're just mad you can't score American bitches
So you're blowing up shit, which
Just goes to prove

That eighteen year old bombs are dynamite
Yes, eighteen year old bombs are dynamite
(What kind of a man sits Indian style?)

Camping with your bros, as your playoff beard grows
Ain't gonna get your wack ass laid
Camping with your bros, as your playoff beard grows
Ain't gonna get your wack ass laid

Trust me holmes, you would kill for American bitches
And the freedom of tits if
You only knew, who-hoo


Come to Infidelphia
And fall in love with the unholy
My boy knows this stripper that looks just like Angelina Jolie

Just
Don't bring up
What that club
You belong to does...
Dungeons & Dragons


Where I come from bras are booby traps
And soft targets have a bikini wax

A is for "Apple"
B is for "Balloons"
C is for "Crayons"
D is for "Drum"

Like my scrotum, here it is in a nutshell

One thousand nine hundred and seventy-two
That's the year I got here when my dear mother's water blew
Not really realizing the prize that's been begot to her
The bona fide lo-fi high-octane philosopher
Genius with a penis, the few the proud, the me
I liked me so much, I had to buy the company
Soul for sale, sold to Satan for a hell of a lot of luck
I'm hard to come by, like a straight guy working at Starbucks
Thank the thinkers that think they thunk the thoughts that theorized
Idolized or despised, bet I'm getting recognized
Mount Rushmore it? No, ignore it, can't rock with no big head
Half the people want me, half the people want me dead
I am the Angel of Def with my rhymes against humanity
Teeter-tottering between brilliance and insanity
The one part the Führer, the one part the Pope,
It's the inevitable return, baby, of the Great White Dope
Conclusions you drew, proportions you blew
Lost son of Iggy: false, bigger nose than Ziggy: true
Yes my name is Jimmy Pop, no, my pop's name is Dick
Don't admit to kick it slick, you thick derelict critic
Put down for missed notes, put up with misquotes
Don't want the whole story? Should have bought the Cliff Notes
Like Fingerpainting 101, give me no credit for having class
One thumb on the pulse of the nation, one thumb in your girlfriend's ass
Written on, written off, scoff callin' me a joke
I don't think that I'm a sell-out, but I do enjoy Coke
I struck gold but never took it for granted, that's how I planned it, so can it
Around the planet, fans demand it and you'll never understand it
When I die, no lie, plan on mass pandemonium
They may display my brain in a pickle jar at the Smithsonian
The one part the Führer, the one part the Pope
It's the inevitable return, baby, of the Great White Dope

One part the Führer, one part the Pope
The inevitable return of the Great White Dope
One part the Führer, one part the Pope
The inevitable return of the Great White Dope
One part the Führer, one part the Pope
The inevitable return of the Great White Dope
One part the Führer, one part the Pope
The inevitable return of the Great White Dope
One part the Führer, one part the Pope
The inevitable return of the Great White Dope
One part the Führer, one part the Pope
The inevitable return of the Great White Dope
One part the Führer, one part the Pope
The inevitable return of the Great White Dope
One part the Führer, one part the Pope
The inevitable return of the Great White Dope

Yo, Bloodhound Gang and Rob Van Winkle together on this track
Stop as we drop this bomb
Blow up this place like another Vietnam
Heavy like a Tyson blow to the dome
Back up son give me room give me room
To set it off like this don't give it up
I'm all up in you 'til you just can't get enough
Real hard to the bone you want more?
I sneak up on you like a sniper at your back door
Phat flavor for your brain you know the time
So check the wrath it's for real cause I'm gonna get mine
Roll up on you like Eastwood
Blowin' up fifteens as I'm ridin' through your neighborhood
I spreads butter like Parkay
Real smooth with the flow and even when I parlay
Do what you feel and check the skill
I'm in your grill peep this I got the raw deal
In your Jeep Cherokee or Land Cruiser
When you're rollin' through the hood you want use a
Track like this all up in your eardrum
So check the E.Q. and let them speakers hum
And gets crazy like Prozac
Hype enough to start a party and illy as a heart attack
Round one round two knock out
Straight to your head like my round never lights out
Tah rah tah rah tah rah boom dee
Tah rah tah rah tah rah boom dee a

Jimmy Jimmy y'all Jimmy damn Jimmy yea
Gimme the mic Rob so I can take it away
Got more lines than the welfare office
Are you upset you'll never get to be as clever as this?
Spreadin' quicker than your mom have a feel but don't cop it
Yeah I stole your beat but that's cause you dropped it
Crude as oil unrefined but slick
I'm gonna get you from behind like a gay convict
Cause my name ain't Quasimodo but I still got a hunch
That like the Jim Jones cult I'll take you out with one punch
You're Spiro Agnew and I'm the Dick you answer to
You're sweatin' like a watermelon at a Baptist barbecue
Sneakin' up like celery yeah I'm stalkin'
I squeak like Stephen Hawking yeah but I'm walkin'
Nose to ground so this Bloodhound will sniff and follow it
I hope you choke on your pride when I make you swallow it
Screamin' like a Mimi when you see me comin' near ya
Like a Kenny Loggins' record no one's ever gonna hear ya
Like a game of Hide and Seek it's all over if I see ya
Cause you're yellower than tinkle and you'll be runnin' like diarrhea

I'm quite the sped, I never shred
Not cool
(Not cool)
But my bros all call me Itch
(With the silent B)
But that spells Bitch
(Fits you perfectly)
Chaz Bono dickbag, word fuck tick, not cool
(Not cool)
And I smell like regret and tequila
(What's that even mean?)
I have no idea
(You're livin' the dream)

Hey you, you dance like those assholes I see
In old Molly Ringwald movies
I think you're as uncool as me
Hey you, you dance like those assholes I see
In old Molly Ringwald movies
I think you're as uncool as me
And I dance!

They don't think you're all that cool
They like you for your step-dad's pool
They don't think you're all that cool
But your vampire fiction rules
I'm such a tit, I say dumb shit
Not cool
(Not cool)
And my friends think that I like men
(That's because you do)
Don't even listen to them
(No one's judging you)
John Goodman gut, slow kid haircut
Not cool
(Not cool)
Do you like Renaissance fairs?
(Where'd you get that scarf?)
Tis what thy lord doth wear
(I'll be in the car)

Hey you, you dance like those assholes I see
In old Molly Ringwald movies
I think you're as uncool as me
Hey you, you dance like those assholes I see
In old Molly Ringwald movies
I think you're as uncool as me
And I dance!

They don't think you're all that cool
They like you for your step-dad's pool
They don't think you're all that cool
But your vampire fiction rules
Dancin' with myself, in the dark, on the ceiling
Dancin' with myself, in the dark, on the ceiling
And I dance!

They don't think you're all that cool
They like you for your step-dad's pool
They don't think you're all that cool
But your vampire fiction rules

Let's go to Civil War reenactments
Throw some back and yell "too soon!" at them

Times New Roman you know the type
Calling me Public Enemy, but don't believe the hype
Tough guy like the one in Star 80 wanna bait me
Hook line sinker now your lady wanna date me
Gave your girl a little wink so you make a big stink
Shoulder's got a chip so you flip like a Tiddlywink
Know what I think? I think you might be Darwin's missing link
Get all bent out of shape when the heat is on just like a Shrinky Dink
Bet I can take a hint better than I can take a hit
Completely incompatible though I'm a pussy and you're a dick
How can you hold a grudge when you can't even hold a job?
Should have known butter but you're not corn on the cob
I choose to use a song for a weapon not a sword struck a chord
If I wanted to see stars I'll watch the Academy Awards
That's why I ran like a Flock Of Seagulls why make-up like Mary Kay?
You must've given up on hair plugs cause now you're going toupee

All in all you're just another dick with no balls
All in all you're just another dick with no balls

Mama said talk this out and resolve
Don't wanna be involved so gimme a call when you evolve
Doggy paddle to the shallow end of the gene pool
Half with it, half-wit, half-finished high school
Give you a piece of my mind but I know you want it splattered
Heard you like your women like you like your shrimp you like 'em battered
Wife beater perfectly fitting apparel
Where's your brother Daryl? Where's your other brother Daryl?
Givin' me that Macho Man Randy Savage stare
Wanna snap into a Slim Jim break my limbs but do I care?
No sorry I'm a lover not a fighter commit your crime
I'll be glad to do your girlfriend, I'll be glad that you do time
Here's the deal I cop a feel you cop a plea but get the maximum
Now we both got records but the difference is mine's platinum
Definitely showed this yellow bellied wimp limp in your cell now though alone
When you're choking your chicken your chick will be choking on this chicken's bone
All in all you're just another dick with no balls
All in all you're just another dick with no balls

You came twice last year like a Sears catalog
'Cause your last boyfriend makes love like Boss Hogg
Well, now you're seeing me but soon I'll have you seeing God
'Cause girl, I'll get you panting like you're Pavlov's dog
Like a DC-10: guaranteed to go down
But baby, your black box is the one that I found
I'll give you the gift that keeps on givin' it won't cost you any money
Then she grabbed me by the ears and said, "Kiss me where it smells funny"
So down I go like I'm 2000 Flushes
I can tell I'm doing something right by the way that she blushes
She's the one that's speechless, I'm the one that's tongue tied
She's thinking, "Holy mackerel." I'm thinking, "Tuna on the side."
There must be something wrong with Al Pacino's nose
'Cause the scent of a woman is like rotten tomatoes
Yeah, I'm snorkeling for clams and it doesn't matter if I wanna be
"Don't come up for air until you kiss me where it smells funny"
Drop my face below her waist and stay on third base
I can tell the cherry's ripe by the way it tastes
Yeah, I could make a lot of wine with the yeast I find inside her panties
And then drink it while eating out down at the Seafood Shanty
Drop my face below her waist and stay on third base
I can tell the cherry's ripe by the way it tastes
Yeah, I could make a lot of wine with the yeast I find inside her panties
And then drink it while eating out down at the Seafood Shanty
Drop my face below her waist and stay on third base
I can tell the cherry's ripe by the way it tastes
Yeah, I could make a lot of wine with the yeast I find inside her panties
And then drink it while eating out down at the Seafood Shanty
