Uh-huh, uh-huh, that's the way it is
'Cause life's like this
Uh-huh, uh-huh, that's the way it is

Chill out, whatcha yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be, you would see
I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talkin' to me one-on-one
But you become

Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get
And you turn it into honesty
And promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no
You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you are and where it's at, you see
You're makin' me
Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know, you're not foolin' anyone
When you become

Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?

He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth

Five years from now, she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees
Skater boy rockin' up MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down
He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside
He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm with the skater boy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I said, "See you later, boy" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'll be backstage after the show (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'll be at our studio (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Singin' the song we wrote (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
About a girl you used to know (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm with the skater boy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I've gotta keep the calm before the storm
I don’t want less, I don't want more
Must bar the windows and the doors
To keep me safe, to keep me warm
Yeah, my life is what I'm fighting for
Can’t part the sea, can't reach the shore
And my voice becomes the driving force
I won't let this pull me overboard

God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don’t let me drown

So pull me up from down below
’Cause I'm underneath the undertow
Come dry me off and hold me close
I need you now, I need you most

God, keep my head above water
Don’t let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don’t let me, don't let me drown
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
(I keep my head above water, above water)
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown
And I can't see in the stormy weather
I can't seem to keep it all together
And I, I can't swim the ocean like this forever
And I can't breathe
God, keep my head above water
I lose my breath, at the bottom
Come rescue me, I'll be waiting
I'm too young to fall asleep

So God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees

Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown (Don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown
And keep my head above water, above water
(Don't let me, don't let me drown)38EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm standin' on the bridge
I'm waitin' in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothing but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening, but there's no sound

Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new?
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you
I'm with you, mmm

I'm lookin' for a place
I'm searchin' for a face
Is anybody here I know?
'Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new?

Oh, why is everything so confusing?
Maybe I'm just out of my mind

I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd need you there when I cried
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie is made up on your side

When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin' too
When you're gone, the words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin' too
And when you're gone, the words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

We were made for each other, out here forever
I know we were, yeah, yeah
And all I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul
I can hardly breathe, I need to feel you here with me, yeah

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin' too
When you're gone, the words I need to hear
Will always get me through the day

All those crazy things we did (Things we did)
Didn't think about it, just went with it (Went with it)
You're always there, you're everywhere
But right now, I wish you were here

Singin' Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boombox blarin' as we're fallin' in love
Got a bottle of whatever, but it’s gettin' us drunk
Singin', "Here's to never growing up"

Call up all our friends
Go hard this weekend
For no damn reason
I don't think we'll ever change
Meet you at the spot
Half past ten o'clock
We don't ever stop
And we're never gonna change

Say, won't you say forever?
Stay, if you stay forever
Hey, we can stay forever young

Singin' Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boombox blarin' as we're fallin' in love
Got a bottle of whatever, but it’s gettin' us drunk
Singin', "Here's to never growing up"
We'll be running down the street yelling, "Kiss my ass"
I'm like yeah, whatever, we’re still living like that
When the sun's going down, we'll be raising our cups
Singin', "Here's to never growing up"
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
(Here's to never growing up)
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
(Here's to never growing up)

We live like rock stars
Dance on every bar
This is who we are
I don't think we'll ever change (Hell no)
They say, "Just grow up"
But they don't know us
We don't give a fuck
And we're never gonna change

Say, won't you say forever?
Stay, if you stay forever
Hey, we can stay forever young

I ain't playing no games
'Cause I've got nothing left to lose
I'm so tired of circular motions
They leave me dizzy and confused
My heart, oh no, is not your revolving door
I get stuck spinning and spinning and spinning
Oh, 'til I collapse on the floor

But every time that you touch me
I forget what we're fighting about
Oh, you come and you leave
Shame on me for believing every word out of your mouth

Tell me it's over if it's really over
'Cause it don't feel like it's over
Whenever you're closing the door, no
So tell me it's over

Darling, you
Oh, you taste so bittersweet
Can't get you off of my lips
You're dangerous
Wanna take me like a thief
Oh, and I
I should let this go
I try and I try, I try
But why, why won't you leave me alone?

Tell me it's over if it's really over
'Cause it don't feel like it's over
Whenever you're closing the door, no
So tell me it's over if it's really over
'Cause every time you come over
It doesn't feel over no more
So tell me it's over

I keep on leaving the light on
Hoping to find something else, oh
I've played the fool for the last time
I just can't do this myself

Tell me it's over if it's really over
'Cause it don't feel like it's over
Whenever you're closing the door, no
Tell me it's over if it's really over
'Cause every time you come over
It doesn't feel over no more
So tell me it's over13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Eh-oh
You shoulda known better, better to fuck with someone like me
Eh-oh
Forever and ever, you're gonna wish I was your wifey

Don't act so innocent, this was no accident
You planned this in the end and now it's over
Say what you wanna say, you lied and I got played
You threw it all away and now it's over

Just face it, we didn't make it
You bit off more than you can chew, can you taste it?

Eh-oh, you should've known better, better to fuck with someone like me
Eh-oh, forever and ever you're gonna wish I was your wifey
Should've held on, should've treated me right
I gave you one chance, you don't get it twice
Eh-oh, and we'll be together never, so baby, you can bite me

Don't hold your breath 'cause you're still chokin' on your words
Those things you said might be the last ones that I heard
So come pick up your clothes from the front yard
Sprinklers on, burn the rest in the backyard
Shoulda had the guts to say goodbye
Now you're gonna have regrets for the rest of your life
Just face it, we didn't make it
You bit off more than you can chew, can you taste it?

Eh-oh
You shoulda known better, better to fuck with someone like me
Eh-oh
Forever and ever, you're gonna wish I was your wifey
Shoulda held on, shoulda treated me right
I gave you one chance, you don't get it twice
Eh-oh
And we'll be together never, so baby, you can bite me

I bet you taste me on the tip of your tongue
Tip of your tongue, tip of your tongue
I fell fast when I know I should've run
Know I should've run, know I should've run
I bet you taste me on the tip of your tongue
Tip of your tongue, tip of your tongue
I fell fast when I know I should've run
Know I should've run, know I should've run

Eh-oh
You shoulda known better, better to fuck with someone like me (Like me)
Eh-oh
Forever and ever, you're gonna wish I was your wifey (Your wifey, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Love that once hung on the wall
Used to mean something
But now it means nothing
The echoes are gone in the hall
But I still remember
The pain of December

Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say
I'm sorry, it's too late

I'm breakin' free from these memories
Gotta let it go, just let it go
I've said goodbye, set it all on fire
Gotta let it go, just let it go

Oh-oh
Oh-oh

You came back to find I was gone
And that place is empty
Like the hole that was left in me
Like we were nothing at all
It's not what you meant to me
Thought we were meant to be
Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say (Left you could say)
I'm sorry, it's too late

I'm breakin' free from these memories
Gotta let it go, just let it go
I've said goodbye, set it all on fire
Gotta let it go, just let it go

I let it go (And now I know)
A brand new life (Is down this road)
And when it's right (You always know)
So this time (I won't let go)

There's only one thing left here to say
Love's never too late
I've broken free from those memories
I've let it go, I've let it go
And two goodbyes led to this new life
Don't let me go, don't let me go
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Won't let you go
Don't let me go
Won't let you go
Don't let me go
Won't let you go
Don't let me go
Won't let you go
Don't let me go13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control (Oh, oh)
But you don't really give a shit
You go with it, go with it, go with it
'Cause you're fuckin' crazy rock 'n' roll
You said, "Hey, what's your name?"
It took one look and now I'm not the same
Yeah, you said, "Hey," and since that day
You stole my heart and you're the one to blame, yeah

And that's why I smile
It's been a while
Since everyday and everything
Has felt this right, and now
You turn it all around
And suddenly, you're all I need
The reason why I-I-I, I smile

Last night I blacked out, I think
What did you, what did you put in my drink?
I remember makin' out and then (Oh, oh)
I woke up with a new tattoo
Your name was on me and my name was on you
I would do it all over again
You said, "Hey (Hey), what's your name?" (What's your name?)
It took one look and now I'm not the same
Yeah, you said, "Hey," (Hey) and since that day (Since that day)

Well, I couldn't tell you
Why she felt that way
She felt it every day
And I couldn't help her
I just watched her make
The same mistakes again

What's wrong, what's wrong now? (What's)
Too many, too many problems (Wrong)
Don't know where she belongs (No)
Where she belongs

She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside

Open your eyes (Open your eyes)
And look outside
Find the reasons why
You've been rejected (You've been rejected)
And now you can't find
What you've left behind
Be strong, be strong now (Be)
Too many, too many problems (Strong)
Don't know where she belongs (No)
Where she belongs

She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside

Her feeling she hides, her dreams she can't find
She's losin' her mind, she's fallen behind
She can't find her place, she's losin' her faith
She's fallen from grace, she's all over the place
Yeah

She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside

She's lost inside, lost inside, oh, oh
She's lost inside, lost inside, oh, oh

Let 'em know that we're still rock 'n' roll

I don't care about my makeup
I like it better with my jeans all ripped up
Don't know how to keep my mouth shut
You say "So what?" (What?)
I don't care if I'm a misfit
I like it better than the hipster bullshit
I am the motherfuckin' princess
You still love it (Yeah)

Some-somehow, it's a little different when I'm with you
You know what I really am all about
You know how it really goes (Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah)

Don't care about a reputation (Nuh-uh)
Must be living in the wrong generation
This is your invitation
Let's get wasted (Yeah)
