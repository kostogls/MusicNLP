Let me know that I've done wrong
When I've known this all along
I go around a time or two
Just to waste my time with you

Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one
That needs to know

I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
My dirty little secret, who has to know?

When we live such fragile lives
It's the best way we survive
I go around a time or two
Just to waste my time with you

Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one
That needs to know
I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
My dirty little secret, who has to know?

The way she feels inside (Inside)
Those thoughts I can't deny (Deny)
These sleeping dogs won't lie (Won't lie)
And all I've tried to hide
It's eating me apart
Trace this line back

I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret)

I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
My dirty little secret, dirty little secret
Dirty little secret, who has to know? Who has to know?20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you're still probably working
At a nine to five pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

Now where's your picket fence, love?
And where's that shiny car?
And did it ever get you far?
You never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?

And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lying

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell
Tomorrow, you'll be thinking to yourself
"Yeah, where did it all go wrong?"
But the list goes on and on

And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lying

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell

Now, you'll never see what you've done to me
You can take back your memories, they're no good to me
And here's all your lies, you can look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look that you wear so well
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell!)
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)
When you hear this song and you sing along, no you never tell (No you never tell)
Then you're the fool, I'm just as well, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)

When you hear this song, I hope that it will give you hell
(Give you hell)
You can sing along, I hope that it puts you through hell49EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Your subtleties, they strangle me
I can't explain myself at all
And all the wants and all the needs
All I don't want to need at all

The walls start breathing, my mind's unweaving
Maybe it's best you leave me alone
A weight is lifted on this evening
I give the final blow

When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight, it ends tonight

A falling star, at least I fall alone
I can't explain what you can explain
You're finding things that you didn't know
I look at you with such disdain

The walls start breathing, my mind's unweaving
Maybe it's best you leave me alone
A weight is lifted on this evening
I give the final blow
When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight, it ends tonight
Just a little insight won't make this right
It's too late to fight, it ends tonight
It ends tonight

Now I'm on my own side
It's better than being on your side
It's my fault when you're blind
It's better that I see it through your eyes
All these thoughts locked inside
Now you're the first to know

When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight, it ends tonight
Just a little insight won't make this right
It's too late to fight, it ends tonight
It ends, when darkness turns to light
It ends tonight, it ends tonight
Just a little insight won't make this right
It's too late to fight, it ends tonight

It ends tonight
Tonight, inside
When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Go ahead as you waste your days with thinking
When you fall, everyone stands
Another day and you've had your fill of sinking
With the life held in your
Hands are shaking cold
These hands are meant to hold (Speak to me)

When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know ya do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
Move along

So a day when you've lost yourself completely
Could be a night when your life ends
Such a heart that will lead you to deceiving
All the pain held in your
Hands are shaking cold
Your hands are mine to hold
Speak to me

When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know ya do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
When everything is wrong, we move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
When everything is wrong, we move along
(Along) along (Along) along (Along) along (Along)

When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along
Just to make it through

When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know ya do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
(Just to make it through)
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know ya do (Like I know ya do)
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
Right back what is wrong
We move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
Right back what is wrong
We move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
Right back what is wrong
We move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
Right back what is wrong
We move along27EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Days swiftly come and go
I'm dreaming of her
She's seeing other guys
Emotions astir
The sun is gone
The nights are long
And I am left while the tears fall

Did you think that I would cry
On the phone?
Do you know what it feels like
Being alone?
I'll find someone new

(Swing) Swing, swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way to carry on again?

Wish cast into the sky
I'm moving on
Sweet beginnings do arise
She knows I was wrong
The notes are old
They bend, they fold
And so do I to a new love
Did you think that I would cry
On the phone?
Do you know what it feels like
Being alone?
I'll find someone new

(Swing) Swing, swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way to carry on again?

Bury me
(You thought your problems were gone)
Carry me
(Away, away, away)

(Swing) Swing, swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way to carry on again?
(Swing) Swing, swing from the tangles of
My heart is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way to carry on again?

There's a place
Somewhere that's between dream and awake
That's where we'll find each other
And I know that that sounds stupid, but it'll give us both something to find
When we were kids
All run-and-gun and back-talk kind of kids
We'd get drunk out on the sidewalk
And we'd laugh ourselves home
We used to do that kinda shit all the time

And what I fight today, I always keep those yesterdays in my mind

All I want, wanted
Is to be want, wanted by you

Cause when goodbyes
Get easy, weâ€™ll all be alone
But why God, why?
Can't this one just be even though
That I'm gearing up for this battle
Even if I know that I may never win
When you throw yourself away, just to throw yourself away again

All I want, wanted
Is to be want, wanted by you
All I need, I needed
Is to be need, needed by you

In your heart, that's where I'll always be
Now close your eyes, and I will never leave
It's funny how I see us hand in hand
I miss you already, understand
That I know that you aren't ready
But you don't get to pick the day
That the worst one in your life will land right on
I can hear you beg for more
I can hold you in this song

All I want, wanted
Is to be want, wanted by you
By you, and honey
All I need, all I needed
Yeah, is to be, just to be needed by youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Maybe I'm a bad seed
Blame it on the TV
And maybe it was just because my grandma raised me
Tell me what all this is
Yeah, tell me what honesty is
You need a body cast for all my broken promises

Told you not to hold your breath (Told you)
You're turning blue the way I make you (Not to)

Sweat! Sweat! Sweat!
I'm making you
Sweat, sweat, sweat
I'm making you
Sweat! Sweat! Sweat!
I'm making you
Sweat, sweat, sweat

I'm not a basic dude
But I'm just a waste of you
I know it's hard to face the music that I play to you
Like I'm dropping a bomb
Go and cry to your momma
Life is such a comedy, so just spare me the drama
Told you not to hold your breath (Told you)
You're turning blue the way I make you (Not to)

Sweat! Sweat! Sweat!
I'm making you
Sweat, sweat, sweat
I'm making you
Sweat! Sweat! Sweat!
I'm making you
Sweat, sweat, sweat

And don't come crying over spilled perfume
It smells like shit to you
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Say you're dying, that's so typical you (Told)
I've got nothing to prove (You)
Told you not to hold your breath (Not)
It's getting in the way I make you (To)

Sweat, sweat, sweat
I'm making you
Sweat! Sweat! Sweat!
I'm making you
Sweat, sweat, sweat
I'm making you

From the tongue, it slips some simple twist of fate
To shape and shake the room we were standing in
And I remember then the silence made me weightless
In the tonic of you once again
Where ignorance was bliss
Ignorance was this place we could exist and then surrender
Do you remember?

The day you said it
That's when I knew, that's when I knew, that's when I knew
I'll never forget it
The day you said it
That's when I knew, that's when I knew, that's when I knew
I'll make you regret it


Now I'm staring at the ceiling wide awake
Man, shit gets real when you're alone
(I wonder if you'll ever know)
There's these voices in my head
They're screaming words I should've said
But I don't know
I can't let go
And you are down
Your taste was in my mouth
The lipstick on the window
You were gone
The day you said it
That's when I knew, that's when I knew, that's when I knew
I'll never forget it
The day you said it
That's when I knew, that's when I knew, that's when I knew
I'll make you regret it


It comes and goes around
Burn your bridges down
Kiss the ground and turn the other cheek
Why don't you close your eyes one last time for me?
It comes and goes around
Burn your bridges down
Kiss the ground and turn the other cheek
Why don't you close your eyes one last time for me?

The day you said it
That's when I knew, that's when I knew, that's when I knew
I'll never forget it
The day you said it

She's a girl who had it all
M-M-M-M-M-Molly was her name
Friday night, she had a ball
She liked her drinks, see, and her adderall
Molly wonâ€™t stop until it's all gone

Send her to heaven (Send her to heaven)
Could you send her to heaven?
Woah, woah (Send her to heaven)
She's a party girl and sheâ€™s had a lot
She tried to quit, yeah, but she just can't stop
She goes to 11, send her to heaven

She went fast and she went slow, yeah
And she's breaking my knees
Waves would crash in her undertow
Yeah, she got eyes, she couldn't see it though
Oh Molly, won't you come back?
But she's all gone

Send her to heaven (Send her to heaven)
Could you send her to heaven?
Woah, woah (Send her to heaven)
She's a piece of string and she's tied to knots
She tried to quit, yeah, but she just canâ€™t stop
She goes to 11, send her to heaven
See the way she hides behind
All the little white lies that she tells you
And she bites her pillow
She lets go, just so slow

Sent her to heaven, sent her to heaven
You sent her to heaven
Woah, woah woah (Send her to heaven)
Flying high as a kite, wasnâ€™t high enough
She said it was good, but it must've been rough
She goes to 11, send her to heaven

She said she was going with her best friend Kevin
Send her to heaven (Send her to heaven)
She was last seen in the parking lot of a 7-11
Sent her to heaven (Send her heaven)

I never thought that I was so blind
I can finally see the truth
It's me for you
Tonight, you can't imagine that I'm by your side
'Cause it's never gonna be the truth
So far for you

But can you hear me say?
Don't throw me away
And there's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow

I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every day, but all I have is time
Our love's the perfect crime
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way, and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me

Take everything that I know you'll break
And I give my life away
So far for you
But can you hear me say
Don't throw me away
And there's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow

I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every day, but all I have is time
Our love's the perfect crime
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way, and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me

Tonight, I'm weak (Tonight, I'm weak)
It's just another day without you
And I can't sleep (I can't sleep)
I gave away the world for you to

Hear me say
Don't throw me away
(Don't throw me away)
And there's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow
All I wanna do is touch you
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every day, but all I have is time
Our love's the perfect crime
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way, and when they set me free

I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you

You don't have to move
You don't have to speak
Lips for biting
You're staring me down
A glance makes me weak
Eyes for striking

Now I'm twisted up
When I'm twisted with you
Brush so lightly
And time trickles down
And I'm breathing for two
Squeeze so tightly

I'll be fine, you'll be fine
This moment seems so long
Don't waste now, precious time
We'll dance inside the song
What makes the one to shake you down?
Each touch belongs to each new sound
Say now you want to shake me too
Move down to me, slip into you
She sinks in my mind
As she sheds through her skin
Touch sight, taste like fire
Hands do now
What eyes no longer defend
Hands to fuel desire

I'll be fine, you'll be fine
This moment seems so long
Don't waste now, precious time
We'll dance inside the song
What makes the one to shake you down?
Each touch belongs to each new sound
Say now you want to shake me too
Move down to me, slip into you

And I'll be fine, you'll be fine
Is this fine? I'm not fine
Give me pieces
Give me things to stay awake

What makes the one to shake you down?
Each touch belongs to each new sound
Say now you want to shake me too
Move down to me, slip into you
What makes the one to shake you down?
Each touch belongs to each new sound
Say now you want to shake me too
Move down to me, slip into you

Please just don't play with me
My paper heart will bleed
This wait for destiny won't do
Be with me please I beseech you
Simple things, that make you run away
Catch you if I can

Tears fall, down your face
The taste, is something new
Something that
I know moving on is
Easiest when I am around you

So bottle up old love
And throw it out to sea
Watch it away as you cry
A year has passed
The seasons go

Please just don't play with me
My paper heart will bleed
This wait for destiny won't do
Be with me please I beseech you
Simple things, that make you run away
Catch you if I can
Waiting, day to day it goes through
My lips, are sealed for her
My tongue is
Tied to, a dream of being with you
To settle for less, is not what I prefer

So bottle up old love
And throw it out to sea
Watch it away as you cry
A year has passed
The seasons go

Please just don't play with me
My paper heart will bleed
This wait for destiny won't do
Be with me please I beseech you
Simple things, that make you run away
Catch you if I can

Summer time, the nights are so long
The leaves fall down and so do I into the arms of a friend
Winter nights
My bedside is cold, for I am gone
And spring blossoms you to me3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

This may be the last thing that I write for long
Can you hear me smiling when I sing this song, for you
And only you?
As I leave, will you be someone to say good-bye?
As I leave, will you be someone to wipe your eye?
My foot is out the door, and you can't stop me now

You wanted the best, it wasn't me, will you give it back?
Now I'll take the lead, when there's no more room to make it grow
I'll see you again, you'll pretend you're naive, is this what you want?
Is this what you need, how you end up let me know

As I go, remember all the simple things you know
My mind is just a crutch and I still hope, that you will miss me when I'm gone
This is the last song

The hearts start breaking as the year is gone
The dream's beginning and the time rolls on
It seems so surreal, now I sing it
Somehow I knew that it would be this way
Somehow I knew that it would slowly fade
Now I am gone, just try and stop me now
You wanted the best, it wasn't me, will you give it back?
Now I'll take the lead, when there's no more room to make it grow
I'll see you again, you'll pretend you're naive, is this what you want?
Is this what you need, how you end up let me know

As I go, remember all the simple things you know
My mind is just a crutch and I still hope, that you will miss me when I'm gone
This is the last song

And will you need me now, you'll find a way somehow
You want it too, I want it too

As I go, remember all the simple things you know
My mind is just a crutch and I still hope, that you will miss me when I'm gone

Back me down from backing up
Hold your breath now, it's stacking up
Etched with marks, but I can deal
And you're the problem and you can't feel

Try this on, straightjacket feeling
So maybe I won't be alone
Take back now, my life you're stealing
Yesterday was hell

But today, I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you would be
That face is tearing holes in me again

Trust you is just one defense
Off a list of others, you don't make sense
Beg me time and time again
To take you back now, but you can't win

Take back now, my life you're stealing
Yesterday was hell
But today, I'm fine without you
Run away this time without you
And all I ever thought you would be
That face is tearing holes in me again
But today, I'm fine without you
Run away this time without you
And all the things you put me through
I'm holding on by letting go of you

And when that memory slips away
There will be a better view from here
And only lonesome you remains
And just the thought of you I fear
It falls away, yesterday was hell

But today, I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you would be
That face is tearing holes in me again
But today, I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all the things you put me through
I'm holding on by letting go of you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Now we're broken on the floor
She just wants me to share her
It hasn't been this way before
She just wants me to dare her

The phone rings and she screams
"Stab my back, it's better
When I bleed for you
Walk on me, it never was enough to do"
I can't get past her
Falling faster
It's true
It hasn't done a lot for you

And every time he held you close
Yeah, were you thinking of me?
When I needed you the most
Well, I hope that you're happy

"Stab my back, it's better

Walk on me, it never was enough to do"

It's better when I bleed for you
I hope that love he gave you
Was just enough to save you
You nearly broke my heart
Just look at what you're tearing apart

Stab my back

There are few who'd deny, at what I do I am the best
For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort of my ghost like charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With the wave of my hand, and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet
Yet year after year, it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing
Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there, far from my home
A longing that I've never known
I'm a master of fright, and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France
And since I am dead, I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations
But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown, if they only understood
He'd give it all up if he only could
Oh, there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Iâ€™ve been known a thousand ways
Choked a hundred hearts in half as many days
Oh no, I think so
And I get so lost inside this city
You ugly girls all look so pretty
Itâ€™s true
What am I supposed to do?
I still got you waiting
Look out your window
What do you see?
You donâ€™t see me
Youâ€™re a pretty little flower
Iâ€™m a busy little bee
Honey, thatâ€™s all you need to see
I can take you for an hour
But then Iâ€™m gonna leave
Honey I know youâ€™ll wait for me
Youâ€™re all alone but you understand
That weâ€™re too young to start making plans agreeing
Monogamyâ€™s not a part of me
And I know my line and is just a sin
But I swear to you Iâ€™m gonna do it again
Iâ€™m not making any friends
I just wanted you to wait
There out your window
What do you see?
You donâ€™t see me
Cause youâ€™re a pretty little flower
But Iâ€™m a busy little bee
Honey, thatâ€™s all you need to see
I can take you for an hour
Baby then Iâ€™m gonna leave
Honey I know youâ€™ll wait for me
Pulled out your picture the other day
(Oh isnâ€™t that sweet)
You didnâ€™t have that much to say
(Cause it wasn't even me)
Cause I know that you said
Iâ€™m better off on my own and Iâ€™m better off dead
I just want you there to wait
Look out your window
What do you see?
You donâ€™t see me
Come on, come on, come on
Pretty little flower
Iâ€™m a busy little bee
Honey thatâ€™s all you need to see
I can take you for an hour
Maybe two or maybe three
Honey, I know youâ€™ll wait for me

Here's another pity
And there's another chance
Try to learn a lesson, but you can't
If we can burn a city
In futures and in past
Without a change, our lives will never last
'Cause we're going fast

You can sit beside me when the world comes down
If it doesn't matter, then just turn around
We don't need our bags and we can just leave town
You can sit beside me when the world comes down

What can we do better?
And when will we know how?
A man says from a sidewalk to a crowd
If we can change the weather
If you wanted to yourself
And if you can't, I guess we all need help
Yeah, I need help

You can sit beside me when the world comes down
If it doesn't matter, then just turn around
We don't need our bags and we can just leave town
And you can sit beside me when the world comes down
We say and we do
All the lies, the truth
And all I need is next to me
Yeah, we're going fast

You can sit beside me when the world comes down
If it doesn't matter, then just turn around
Will you be the queen? And I'll be your clown
You can sit beside me when the world comes down

Do you remember when we didn't care?
We were just two kids that took the moment when it was there
Do you remember you at all?
Another heart calls

Yeah, I remember when we stole the night
We'd lie awake, but dream until the sun would wash the sky
Just as soon as I see you
But didn't I, but didn't I tell you?
As deep as I need you
You wanna leave it all

What can I do? Say it's true
Or everything that matters breaks in two
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you

Talk to me, I'm throwing myself in front of you
But this could be the last mistake that I would ever wanna do
Yeah, all I ever do is give
It's time you see my point of view
Just as soon as I see you
But didn't I, but didn't I tell you?
As deep as I need you
You wanna leave it all

What can I do? Say it's true
Or everything that matters breaks in two
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you
And I know what you want is to figure it out
And God knows I do too
What can I do? Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you

Oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh
Na na na-na na
Oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh
Na na na-na na

I'm sorry
So what?
But you don't think I've said enough
I'm sorry
I don't care, you were never there
As soon as I see you
But didn't I, but didn't I tell you
As deep as I need you
You wanna leave it all

What can I do? Say it's true
Or everything that matters breaks in two
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you
But I know what you want is to figure it out
And God knows I do, too
Yeah, what can I do? Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you

(Oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh)
I'll never ask for anyone but you
(Oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh)
I'll never ask for anyone but you
(Oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh)
I'll never ask for anyone but you
(Oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh)
I'll never ask for anyone but you
(Oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh)
I'll never ask for anyone but you
(Oh oh-oh oh, oh oh-oh oh)2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Is there anybody out there?
That wakes up with a bitter taste?
It's a king that we put up there
And he's a short way to fall from grace
It's slowly filling upward
You can stand but you have no ground
I hear it from the lost words
They say it's time that you lost your crown

Don't be so greedy
A dollar's a penny to you
When hearts are beating
Say what you want 'em to do
Wasting away, I see you
When the top of the world falls on you
Finding a day, don't wanna be you
When the top of the world falls on you

Is there anybody out there?
That can see what a man can change?
It's better that you don't care
Because he knows that he's in his stage
I feel the paranoia
When there's a time, put you in your place
In the eyes of those who watch ya
Well they can wait 'til you hit your face
Don't be so greedy
A dollar's a penny to you
When hearts are beating
Say what you want 'em to do
Wasting away, I see you
When the top of the world falls on you
Finally a day, don't wanna be you
When the top of the world falls on you

Paint yourself a picture
When you waste another picture
And you win, and you win, and you win
Paint yourself a picture
And then you break another picture
And you win, and you win, and you win
And you win, yeah you win, and you win

Don't be so greedy
A dollar's a penny to you
When hearts stop beating
Say what you want 'em to do
Wasting away, I see you
When the top of the world falls on you
Finding a day, don't wanna be you
When the top of the world falls on you
Wasting away, I see you
When the top of the world falls on you
Finding a day, don't wanna be you
When the top of the world falls on youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
