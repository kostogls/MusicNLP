A heart of stone, a smoking gun

Turning away from the light, becoming adult
Turning into myself

Turning into the light

No, no, no, she don't think straight

And you don't taste like her and you never ever will

Heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled

Open mouth swallowing us
The children sent home from school
Will not stop crying
And I know that you're busy, do I know that you care?
You got your finger on the pulse, you got your eyes everywhere
And it hurts all the time when you don't return my calls
And you haven't got the time to remember how it was
It's so cold in this house

I can't eat, I can't sleep
I can't sleep, I can't dream
An aversion to light
Got a fear of the ocean

So here we are again

Lord, give me grace and dancing feet
As I conquer all anxiety
The angel told me not to fear
That the power to was in me
For I have learnt the way to pray
Like a muscle growing taut now
Bind the past into a knot
And let the love consume us
Let the love consume us
Let the love consume us

Can you hear the stars now sing
Resounding in D major?
As the god vibration resonates
And pulls us up towards her
Take your shoes off, feel the earth
Beneath your feet respond to touch
And let our laughter now ring forth
As the love consumes us

The love within is moving upwards
Sweeter than any drug
The melody is taking over
Guide my hand through this hurt
Pull back the veil
Let your eyes meet this world
The love within is moving upwards
So don't you want to get high?
Don't you want to get high?
Don't you want to get high?
Don't you want to get-
Don't you want to get high?

I'm sitting on the roof of my house
With a shotgun
And a six pack of beers
Six pack of beers, six pack of beers

The newscaster says "the enemy's among us"
As bombs explode on the 30 bus
Kill your middle class indecision
Now is not the time for liberal thought

So I go hunting for witches

Heads are going to roll
I go hunting for

90's, optimistic as a teen
Now it's terror
Airplanes crash into towers
Into towers, into towers

Taking our women and taking our jobs"
All reasonable thought is being drowned out
By the non-stop baying, baying, baying for blood
So I go hunting for witches

Heads are going to roll

Disparate and misinformed
Fear will keep us all in place

Two ravens in the old oak tree
And one for you and one for me
And bluebells in the late December
I see signs now all the time
The last time we slept together
There was something that was not there
You never wanted to alarm me
But I'm the one that's drowning now

I can sleep forever these days
Cause in my dreams I see you again
But this time-fleshed out fuller face
In your confirmation dress
It was so like you to visit me
To let me know you were okay
It was so like you to visit me
You're always worried about someone else

At your funeral I was so upset
So, so upset
In your life you were larger than this
Statue statuesque
(x2)
I see signs now all the time
That you're not dead, you're sleeping
I believe in anything
That brings you back home to me3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We must talk about our problems
We are in a state of flux

I'd kill for an adventure

Dancing until we knew
So all that we've learned disappeared
When you shouted at me

Concerned and kind
Yet unable to reach me

How you looked that afternoon, there was only you
You said "It's just like a full moon"
Blood beats faster in our veins
We left our trousers by the canal
And our fingers, they almost touched

You should have asked me for it
I would have been brave
You should have asked me for it
How could I say no?

And our love could have soared
Over playgrounds and rooftops
Every park bench screams your name, I kept your tie
I'd have gone wherever you wanted
(I still remember, I still remember)

And on that teachers' training day
We wrote our names on every train
Laughed at the people off to work
So monochrome and so lukewarm
And I can see our days are becoming night
I could feel your heartbeat across the grass
We should have run, I would go with you anywhere
I should have kissed you by the water

You should have asked me for it
I would have been brave
You should have asked me for it
How could I say no?

And our love could have soared

Every park bench screams your name, I kept your tie

Spent my commission on another diversion
And I don't got no meaning, no purpose left at all
My pastor tells me that my, my light is dimming and I've
Been too long drifting in a ocean
It's OK, you just need faith
Been looking for answers in the wrong place
But how do I tell him that there, there's something missing?
And I don't got no substance since you've gone

Every day I go down to the water
And I pray since you left me that way
Oh Lord, I'm trying to keep my mind
On the good news that's in my heart

For the good, good news, for the good, good news
For the good, good news, for the good, good news
For the good, good news, for the good, good news
Since my baby left, my light refuses to shine
Like a bird without a song or a sun that will not rise

Now I can make the eyes at anyone that I desire
Throwing down with all the lost boys at the very edge of town
Now I can spin a lie that binds me up all through the night
Cause I've got no one home to answer to this time
Every day is a repeat
Like a carrier bag stuck in a tree
I used to find my answers in the gospels of St. John
But now I find them at the bottom of this shot glass
Every day I go down to the water
And I pray since you left me that way
Oh Lord, I'm trying to keep my sights
On the good news that's in my heart

For the good, good news, for the good, good news
For the good, good news, for the good, good news

Waiting for the 7:18
January is endless
Weary-eyed and forlorn
The Northern Line is the loudest
Sitting in silence in bars after work
I've got nothing to add or contest
Can I still kick a ball a hundred yards?
We cling to bottles and memories of the past

(Give me moments) Just give me moments
(Give me moments) Not hours or days
(Give me moments) Just give me moments
(Give me moments)

Grinding your teeth in the middle of the night
With the sadness of those molars
Spend all your spare time trying to escape
With crosswords and Sudoku
If I could do it again, I'd make more mistakes
I'd not be so scared of falling
If I could do it again, I'd climb more trees
I'd pick and I'd eat more wild blackberries
(Give me moments) Just give me moments
(Give me moments) Not hours or days
(Give me moments) Just give me moments
