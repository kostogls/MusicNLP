Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh

With just a look, they shook, and heavens bowed before him
Simply a look can break your heart
The stars that pierce the sky, he left them all behind
We’re left to wonder why he left us all behind

Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh

Dreams of his crash won’t pass, oh, how they all adored him
Beauty will last when spiraled down
The stars that mystify, he left them all behind
And how his children cried, "He left us all behind!"

Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh...

What's the hook, the twist within this verbose mystery?
I would gladly bet my life upon it
That the ghost you love, your ray of light will fizzle out
Without hope
We're the empty set just floating through empty skin
Ever searching for what we were promised
Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go
But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?
Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh
Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Oh-oh!25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'll lay me down tonight
Much further down
Swim in the calm tonight
This art does drown

(What follows) me as the whitest lace of light
(Will swallow whole) just begs to be imbrued
(What follows) has led me to this place
Where I belong, with all erased
What follows

All insects sing tonight
The coldest sound
I'd send God's grace tonight
Could it be found?

(What follows) me as the whitest lace of light
(Will swallow whole) just begs to be imbrued
(What follows) has led me to this place
Where I belong, with all erased

I'll lay me down tonight
Much further down
Watch stars go out tonight
On sinking ground
I'll lay me down, I'll lay me down

(What follows) me as the whitest lace of light
(Will swallow whole) just begs to be imbrued
(What follows) has led me to this place
Where I belong, with all erased

What follows will swallow whole

I came here by day, but I left here in darkness
And found you, found you on the way
And now, it is silver and silent, it is silver and cold
You, in somber resplendence, I hold

Your sins into me
Oh, my beautiful one
Your sins into me
As a rapturous voice escapes, I will tremble a prayer
And I'll beg for forgiveness
(Your sins into me) Your sins into me
Oh, my beautiful one

Light, like the flutter of wings, feel your hollow voice rushing into me
As you're longing to sing
So I, I will paint you in silver, I will wrap you in cold
I will lift up your voice as I sink

Your sins into me
Oh, my beautiful one, now
Your sins into me
As a rapturous voice escapes, I will tremble a prayer
And I'll beg for forgiveness
(Your sins into me) Your sins into me
Cold in life's throes, I'll fall asleep for you
Cold in life's throes, I only ask you turn away
Cold in life's throes, I'll fall asleep for you
Cold in life's throes, I only ask you turn
As they seep into me, oh, my beautiful one, now

Your sins into me
Oh, my beautiful one
Your sins into me
As a rapturous voice escapes, I will tremble a prayer
And I'll beg for forgiveness
(Your sins into me) Your sins into me
Your sins into me
Oh, my beautiful one, now
Your sins into me
As a rapturous voice escapes, I will tremble a prayer
And I'll beg for forgiveness
(Your sins into me) Your sins into...

Don't waste your touch, you won't feel anything
Or were you sent to save me?
I've thought too much, you won't find anything
Worthy of redeeming

Yo he estado aquí muchas veces antes y regresó

To break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away

Imperfect cry, and scream in ecstasy
So what befalls the flawless?
Look what I've built (please don't do this)
It shines so beautifully (why won't you look at me)
Now watch as it destroys me

Y regreso aquí otra vez y comienzo

To break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away
Break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away

I left it all behind, and never said goodbye
I left it all behind, and never said goodbye
I left it all behind, and never said goodbye
I left it all to die
I saw its birth, I watched it grow
I felt it change me
I took the life, I ate it slow
Now it consumes me

Break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away
Break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away

I remember when I was told of story of
Crushed velvet, candle wax, and dried up flowers
The figure on the bed all dressed up in roses, calling
Beckoning to sleep, offering a dream
Words were as mystical as purring animals
The circle of rage, the ghosts on the stage appeared
The time was so tangible, I'll never let it go
Ghost stories handed down reached secret tunnels below
No one could see me
I fell into yesterday
Our dreams seemed not far away
I want to, I want to, I want to stay
I fell into fantasy
Words were as mystical as purring animals
The circle of rage, the ghosts on the stage appeared
The time was so tangible, I'll never let it go
Ghost stories handed down reached secret tunnels below
No one could see me
I fell into yesterday
Our dreams seemed not far away
I want to, I want to, I want to stay
I fell into fantasy
The girl on the wall always waited for me
And she was always smiling
The teenage death boys, the teenage death girls
And everyone was dancing
Nothing could touch us then, no one could change us then
Everyone was dancing
Nothing could hurt us then, no one could see us then
Everyone was dancing
No one could see me
I fell into yesterday
Our dreams seemed not far away
I want to, I want to, I want to stay
I fell into fantasy
Our dreams seemed not far away
I fell into fantasy1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Warn your warmth to turn away
Here, it's December every day (I like that)
Press your lips to the sculptures
And surely, you'll stay (love like winter)
For of sugar and ice
I am made, I am made

(It's in the blood
It's in the blood)
I met my love before I was born
(He wanted love
I taste of blood)
He bit my lip, and drank my war
From years before, from years before

She exhales vanilla lace
I barely dreamt her, yesterday (yesterday)
Read the lines in the mirror through the lipstick trace
(Por siempre)
She said, "It seems you're somewhere far away," to his face

(It's in the blood
It's in the blood)
I met my love before I was born
(She wanted love
I taste of blood)
She bit my lip, and drank my war
From years before, from years before
Love like winter, oh-oh, oh-oh
Love like winter, winter
Three, four

(It's in the blood
It's in the blood)
I met my love before I was born
(He wanted love
I taste of blood)
He bit my lip, and drank my war
From years before, from years before
From years before2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Am I coy enough? Not boy enough?
You wanted me in this dress
Or nothing else you say I am, I am
Not scared enough, prepared enough
You wanted me in distress
I've nothing left to fear, I am, I am here

I'll wait for you another night (As you like)
Dressed in Himalayan white
I'll wait for you some other night (Dressed as you like)
Dressed in Himalayan white

Am I loud too much, and proud too much?
You wanted me in this stance
Or on my back, you said I am, I am
Not red enough, in bed enough
I've given up on romance
I've nothing left for love, I am, I am here

I'll wait for you another night (As you like)
Dressed in Himalayan white
I'll wait for you some other night (Dressed as you like)

Of late, it's harder just to go outside
To leave this dead space with hatred, so alive

Writhing with sickness, thrown into banality, I decay
Killed by the weakness, but forced to return, turn it off

I watch the stars as they fall from the sky
I held a fallen star and it wept for me, dying
I feel the fallen stars encircle me, now as they cry

Out there, so quickly, grows malignant tribes
Post-human extinction excels, unrecognized

Feeling surrounded, so bored with mortality, I decay
All of this hatred is fucking real, turn it on, yeah

I watch the stars as they fall from the sky
I held a fallen star and it wept for me, dying
I feel the fallen stars encircle me, now as they cry
It won't be all right, despite what they say
Just watch the stars tonight as they, as they disappear, disintegrate
And I disintegrate 'cause this hate is fucking real
And I hope to shade the world as stars go out and I disintegrate1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I cannot leave here, I cannot stay
Forever haunted, more than afraid
Asphyxiate on words I would say
I'm drawn to a blackened sky as I turn blue

There are no flowers, no, not this time
There'll be no angels gracing the lines
Just these stark words, I find
I'd show a smile, but I'm too weak
I'd share with you, could I only speak
Just how much this hurts me

I cannot stay here, I cannot leave
Just like all I loved, I'm make believe
Imagine heart, I disappear
Seems no one will appear here and make me real

There are no flowers, no, not this time
There'll be no angels gracing the lines
Just these stark words, I find
I'd show a smile, but I'm too weak
I'd share with you, could I only speak
Just how much this hurts me
I'd tell you how it haunts me
I'd tell you how it haunts me
(Cuts through my days, and sinks into my dreams)
I'd tell you how it haunts me
(Cuts through my days, and sinks into my dreams)
You don't care that it haunts me

There are no flowers, no, not this time
There'll be no angels gracing the lines
Just these stark words, I find
I'd show a smile, but I'm too weak
I'd share with you, could I only speak
Just how much this hurts me

Let's admire the pattern forming
Murderous filigree
I'm caught in the twisting of the vine
Go ascend with ivy climbing
Ignore and leave for me
The headstone crumbling behind

I can't help my laughter as she cries
My soul brings tears to angelic eyes

Let's amend the classic story
Close it so beautifully
I'll let animosity unwind
Steal away the darkened pages
Hidden so shamefully
I'll still feel the violence of the lies

I can't stand my laughter as they cry
My soul brings tears to angelic eyes
And miles away my mother cries
Omnipotence nurturing malevolence
I can't stand my laughter as they cry
My soul brings tears to angelic eyes
And miles away my mother cries
Omnipotence nurturing malevolenceEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Calling tears from deep inside, oh, you're so exquisite
And in the mirror, all midnight eyes
Oh, if I could remain, but it's just a visit
All midnight eyes, read "vacancy"
Twisted, twisting

To the lovely dancing lights, I begged, "May I cut in?"
But they never stopped playing their song
Of a joyous song they sing, I've heard whispers
On a freezing note, I resonate

Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end
Just like a memory, it twists me
Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end
Twist, twisting me

You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
On to the melting boy, and melt away
You light as gently, you're so cinematic
Bathed in your radiance, I melt
In the glitter, in the dark, sunk into velvet
Praying this will never end
In the shadow of a star, in static pallor
I realized I never began

Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end
Just like a memory, it twists me
Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end
Twist, twisting me

You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
On to the melting boy, and melt away
You light as gently, you're so cinematic
Bathed in your radiance, I melt

All the colors, upon leaving, all will turn to grey
All the colors, upon leaving, all will turn to grey
(All grey) all the colors (all grey) upon leaving
(All grey) all will turn to grey
(All grey) all the colors (all grey) upon leaving
(All grey) all will turn to grey, grey
Twisting me
You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
On to the melting boy, and melt away
You light as gently, you're so cinematic
Bathed in your radiance

You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
You land as lightly as the new snow, and melt away
You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
Bathed in your radiance, I melt1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Walked away, heard them say
"Poisoned hearts will never change," walked away again
Turned away in disgrace
Felt the chill upon my face, cooling from within

Hard to notice gleaming from the sky
When you're staring at the cracks
Hard to notice what is passing by with eyes lowered
You walked away, heard them say
"Poisoned hearts will never change," walked away again

All the cracks, they lead right to me
And all the cracks will crawl right through me
All the cracks, they lead right to me
And all the cracks will crawl right through me, and I fell apart

As I walked away, heard them say
"Poisoned hearts will never change," walked away again
Turned away in disgrace

Hope unknown
Sometimes just waking is surreal
I pass right through the nameless ones
I know that hope's unknown
Sometimes the water feels so real
As I walk through it fills my lungs, my god I'm drowning
(This day never seems to end)
This pain, never
(This day never seems to end)
This rage I cannot let (go)
I hear them calling my name (Oh)
I feel them gnawing out holes
All throughout my flawless soul
I hear them calling my name (Oh)
I feel them gnawing out holes (Whoa)
All throughout my flawless soul
So alone
Sometimes I swear that I can hear
The taunting of the voiceless ones
I fear that I alone
Fear those who finally ceased to feel
That they're alone inside this place, I am the misplaced
(This day never seems to end)
This pain, never
(This day never seems to end)
This rage I cannot let (go)
I hear them calling my name (Oh)
I feel them gnawing out holes
All throughout my flawless soul
I hear them calling my name (Oh)
I feel them gnawing out holes (Whoa)
All throughout my flawless soul
Now every face looks familiar
Found every face would melt away until now
Everyone
Do you know?
I know your deception

Once there was a boy
Who had a vibrant glow (oh, oh, oh, oh)
But as it goes
Someone took it from him
One day through the rain
I heard him meekly moan (oh, oh, oh, oh)
He said: Will you wrap your arms around me
As I'm falling?"
(Remember when, remember when)
Remember when we were all so beautiful?
(Never again, never again)
But since then we've lost our glow
They said it hurt their eyes
But he would never know (oh, oh, oh, oh)
That they were filled with regret
As their own dissipated
He said, "I now feel more desperately alone (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Even though they wrapped their arms around me
As I'd fallen"
(Remember when, remember when)
Remember when we were all so beautiful?
(Never again, never again)
But since then we've lost our glow
(Remember when, remember when)
Remember when we were all so beautiful?

But since then we've lost our glow

But he would never know
That they were claiming regret

Twenty-six years and seems like I've just begun
To understand my, my intimate is no one
When the director sold the show, who bought its last rites?
They cut the cast, the music, and the lights

This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear
Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time, left me disowned
To this nature, so unnatural
I remain alone

Twenty-six years end, still speaking in these tongues
Such revelations, while understood by no one
When the new actor stole the show, who questioned his grace?
Please clear this house of ill-acquired taste

This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear
Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time and left me disowned
To this nature, so unnatural
I remain alone
Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something
Give me something, give me something real

I lay strewn across the floor, can't solve this puzzle
Everyday, another small piece can't be found
I lay strewn across the floor, pieced up in sorrow
The pieces are lost, these pieces don't fit
Pieced together incomplete and empty

This is my line, this is eternal
How did I ever end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear
Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time and left me disowned
To this nature, so unnatural
I remain alone
This is my line, this is eternal
How did I end up here?
Discarnate, preternatural
My prayers to disappear
Absent of grace, marked as infernal
Ungranted in dead time and left me disowned
To this nature, so unnatural
I remain alone2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I am exploring the inside, I find it desolate
I do implore these confines, now, as they penetrate, "recreate me"

I'm hovering throughout time, I crumble in these days
I crumble, I cannot, I cannot find reflection in these days

(If you listen) Listen, listen
(Listen close) Beat by beat
(You can hear when the heart stops) I saved the pieces
(When it broke) And ground them all to dust

I am destroyed by the inside, I disassociate
I hope to destroy the outside, it will alleviate and elevate me

Like water flowing into lungs, I'm flowing through these days
Like morphine cuts through, through dead end veins, I'm numbing in these days
So...

(If you listen) Listen, listen
(Listen close) Beat by beat
(You can hear when the heart stops) I saved the pieces
(When it broke) And ground them all to dust
I know what died that night, it can never be brought back to life
Once again, I know
I know what died that night, it can never be brought back to life
Once again, I know
I know I died that night and I'll never be brought back to life
Once again, I know
I know I died that night and I'll never be brought back to life
Once again, I know

(If you listen) Listen, listen
(Listen close) Beat by beat
(You can hear when the heart stops) I saved the pieces
(When it broke) And ground them all to dust
