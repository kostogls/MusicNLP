...Congressional reports
President Ford says that he's disappointed
With Congress's performance
In Detroit, a Pontiac, Michigan youth
Was reported dead at the scene of
A head-on collision on Grand Avenue this morning
He was reportedly driving on the wrong side of the boulevard When he struck a delivery truck
And was catapulted through the windshield of his car
The driver of the truck is reported to be uninjured
The identities of both men are being withheld by local police
County legislatures today are expected to rally
To the aid of striking longshoremen
In hopes of ending the nine-month deadlock...
"..Roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day..."

I feel uptight on a Saturday night
Nine o'clock, the radio's the only light
I hear my song, and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do
I got to

Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Getting late, I just can't wait
Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road
First I drink, then I smoke
Start the car and I try to make the midnight show

Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat


Moving fast, down 95
Hit top speed, but I'm still moving much too slow
I feel so good, I'm so alive
Hear my song playing on the radio, it goes

Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock
There's a truck ahead, lights staring at my eyes
Oh my God, no time to turn
I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die
Why?

Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get up!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Get up!

But I can't come home right now
Me and the boys are playing
And we just can't find the sound

Just a few more hours
And I'll be right home to you

Oh, Beth, what can I do? Beth, what can I do?

You say you feel so empty
That our house just ain't a home
And I'm always somewhere else
And you're always there alone

You don't feel right, you can't find a cure
And you're getting less than what you're looking for
You don't have money or a fancy car
And you're tired of wishing on a falling star
You got to put your faith in a loud guitar

You can take a stand, or you can compromise
You can work real hard or just fantasize
But you don't start living until you realize -I got to tell ya!

She sent a picture, but she didn't sign her name
She wore high heels and a little black lace
I knew her body, but I couldn't see her face
She didn't leave a number, not an address or a clue
But something in that photograph reminded me of you

Heavy breathin' never sounded quite so nice
She said "Ooh yeah, I wish that I was there"
