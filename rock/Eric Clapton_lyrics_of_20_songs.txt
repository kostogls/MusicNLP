Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
‘Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven

Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
‘Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in heaven

Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please
Begging please


Beyond the door, there's peace, I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more
Tears in heaven
Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would you be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
Because I know I don't belong
Here in heaven30EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If you want to hang out
You've got to take her out
Cocaine
If you want to get down
Down on the ground
Cocaine

She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine

If you got bad news
You want to kick the blues
Cocaine
When your day is done
And you wanna ride on
Cocaine

She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine

If your day is gone
And you want to ride on
Cocaine
Don't forget this fact
You can't get it back

It's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?"
And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me "Do you feel all right?"
And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight"9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

See if you can spot this one?

What will you do when you get lonely
No one waiting by your side?
You've been running, hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride

Layla, got me on my knees
Layla, begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Tried to give you consolation
Your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
You turned my whole world upside down

Layla, got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please don’t say we'll never find a way
Tell me all my love's in vain
Layla, got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
(Yeah, yeeeeah)

Layla, got me on my knees
Layla, begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

If I could reach the stars
Pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth
That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems
But for now I find
It's only in my dreams

And I can change the world
I will be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world

If I could be king
Even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way
And our love would rule
In this kingdom we have made
'Til then I'd be a fool
Wishing for the day
And I can change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the world

I could change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world

I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy

All around in my home town
They're trying to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy
But I say

I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense
I shot the sheriff, and they say it is a capital offense

Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what I don't know
Every time that I plant a seed
He said, "Kill it before it grows"
He said, "Kill it before it grows"
I say

Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town
All of a sudden I see sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I shot, I shot him down
I say


Reflexes got the better of me
And what is to be must be
Every day the bucket goes to the well
But one day the bottom will drop out
Yes, one day the bottom will drop out
But I say

Stand and deliver
You let them put the fear on you
Stand and deliver
But not a word you heard was true
But if there's nothing you can say
There may be nothing you can do
Do you wanna be a free man
Or do you wanna be a slave?
Do you wanna be a free man
Or do you wanna be a slave?
Do you wanna wear these chains
Until you're lying in the grave?
I don't wanna be a pauper
And I don't wanna be a prince
I don't wanna be a pauper
And I don't wanna be a prince
I just wanna do my job
Playing the blues for friends
Magna Carta, Bill of Rights
The constitution, what's it worth?
You know they're gonna grind us down, ah
Until it really hurts
Is this a sovereign nation
Or just a police state?
You better look out, people
Before it gets too late
You wanna be your own driver
Or keep on flogging a dead horse?
You wanna be your own driver
Or keep on flogging a dead horse?
Do you wanna make it better
Or do you wanna make it worse?
Stand and deliver
You let them put the fear on you
Slow down the river
But not a word of it was true
If there's nothing you can say
There may be nothing you can do
Stand and deliver

Sailing down behind the sun
Waiting for my prince to come
Praying for the healing rain
To restore my soul again
Just a toerag on the run
How did I get here?
What have I done?
When will all my hopes arise?
How will I know him?
When I look in my father's eyes

(Look into my father's eyes)
My father's eyes
When I look in my father's eyes
(Look into my father's eyes)
My father's eyes

Then the light begins to shine
And I hear those ancient lullabies
And as I watch this seedling grow
Feel my heart start to overflow
Where do I find the words to say?
How do I teach him?
What do we play?
Bit by bit, I've realized
That's when I need them
That's when I need my father's eyes


Then the jagged edge appears
Through the distant clouds of tears
I'm like a bridge that was washed away
My foundations were made of clay
As my soul slides down to die
How could I lose him?
What did I try?
Bit by bit, I've realized
That he was here with me
I look into my father's eyes

The rain is falling through the mist
Of sorrow that surrounded me
The sun could never thaw away
The bliss that lays around me

Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain

Her life was like a desert flower
Burning in the sun
Until I found the way to love
It's harder said than done

Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain

Now I know the secret
There is nothing that I lack
If I give my love to you
You'll surely give it back
Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain

There is nothing that is wrong
In wanting you to stay here with me
I know you've got somewhere to go
But won't you make yourself at home and stay with me?
And don't you ever leave

Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

Sun ain't nearly on the rise
We still got the moon and stars above
Underneath the velvet skies love is all that matters
Won't you stay with me?
Don't you ever leave

Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you
I long to see the morning light
Coloring your face so dreamily
So don't you go and say goodbye
You can lay your worries down and stay with me
Don't you ever leave

Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, there's no need to leave so soon

Standing at the crossroads, trying to read the signs
To tell me which way I should go to find the answer
And all the time I know
Plant your love and let it grow

Let it grow, let it grow
Let it blossom, let it flow
In the sun, the rain, the snow
Love is lovely, let it grow

Looking for a reason to check out of my mind
Trying hard to get a friend that I can count on
But there's nothing left to show
Plant your love and let it grow


Time is getting shorter and there's much for you to do
Only ask and you will get what you are needing
The rest is up to you
Plant your love and let it grow

I can feel your body
When I'm lying in bed
Too much confusion
Going around through my head

And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame still burns
Why can't I get over?
When will I ever learn?

Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home

I can see your face
But I know that it's not real
Just an illusion
Caused by how I used to feel

And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame will alway burn
I'll never get over
I know now that I'll never learn
Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I don't care if you never come home
I don't mind if you just keep on
Rowing away on a distant sea
Because I don't love you and you don't love me
You cause a commotion when you come to town
You give them a smile and they melt
Having lovers and friends is all good and fine
But I don't like yours and you don't like mine
La la, la la la la la
La la, la la la la la

I don't care what you do at night
Oh, and I don't care how you get your delights
I will leave you alone, I will just let it be
I don't love you and you don't love me

I got a problem. Can you relate?
I got a woman calling love hate
We made a vow we'd always be friends
How could we know that promises end?
La la, la la la la la
La la, la la la la la

I tried to love you for years upon years
You refuse to take me for real
It's time you saw what I want you to see
And I would still love you, if you'd just love me

I got a problem. Can you relate?
I got a woman calling love hate
We made a vow we'd always be friends

Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spent all my money, didn't have any care
Took all my friends out for a mighty good time
Bought bootleg liquor, champagne and wine
Then I began to fall so low
Lost all my good friends, and nowhere to go
I get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hang on to it 'til that old eagle grins

Because nobody knows you
When you're down and out
In your pocket, not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have many

When you get back on your feet again
Everybody wants to be your long, lost friend
I said it's strange, without any doubt
Nobody knows you when you're down and out


No, nobody knows you

In your pocket, not one penny

Well she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running 'round
Butterflies and zebras, fairy tales
That's all she ever thinks about
When I'm sad she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
Said, "It's all right
Take anything you want
Anything you want, anything."

Little man with his eyes on fire
And his smile so bright
In his hands are the toys you gave
To fill his heart with delight
And in the ring stands a circus clown
Holding up a knife
What you see and what you will hear
Will last you for the rest of your life

And it's sad, so sad
There ain't no easy way round
And it's sad, so sad
All you friends gather round
Because the circus left town

Little man with his heart so pure
And his love so fine
Stick with me and I'll ride with you
'Til the end of the line
Hold my hand and I'll walk with you
Through the darkest night
And when I smile, I'll be thinking of you
And every little thing will be all right

The circus left town, left town
The circus left town, left townEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
