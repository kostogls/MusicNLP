I'm only happy when it rains
I'm only happy when it's complicated
And though I know you can't appreciate it
I'm only happy when it rains
You know I love it when the news is bad
And why it feels so good to feel so sad
I'm only happy when it rains

Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down on me
Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down on me

I'm only happy when it rains
I feel good when things are going wrong
I only listen to the sad, sad songs
I'm only happy when it rains

I only smile in the dark
My only comfort is the night gone black
I didn't accidentally tell you that
I'm only happy when it rains
You'll get the message by the time I'm through
When I complain about me and you
I'm only happy when it rains
Pour your misery down
(Pour your misery down)
Pour your misery down on me
(Pour your misery down)
Pour your misery down

Pour your misery down on me
(Pour your misery down)
Pour your misery down

Pour your misery down on me

(Pour)

You can keep me company
As long as you don't care

I'm only happy when it rains
You wanna hear about my new obsession?
I'm riding high upon a deep depression
I'm only happy when it rains
(Pour some misery down on me)
I'm only happy when it rains
(Pour some misery down on me)
I'm only happy when it rains
(Pour some misery down on me)
I'm only happy when it rains

She gave you everything she had
But she was young and dumb, she'd just turned 21
She didn't care to hang around
So when the shit came down, why she was nowhere to be found
This life can turn a good girl bad
She was the sweetest thing that you had ever seen

You're such a delicate boy
In the hysterical realm
Of an emotional landslide
In physical terms

With your cherry lips and golden curls
You could make grown men gasp when you go walking past them
In your hot pants and high heels
They could not believe that such a body was for real
It seemed like rainbows would appear
Whenever you came near the clouds would disappear
Because you looked just like a girl
Your baby blues would flash and suddenly a spell was cast

You're such a delicate boy
In the hysterical realm
Of an emotional landslide
In physical terms
You hold a candle in your heart
You shine the light on hidden parts
You make the whole world wanna dance
You bought yourself a second chance

Go baby, go, go
We're right behind you
Go baby, go, go
Yeah, we're looking at you

We are not your kind of people
You seem kind of phony
Everything's a lie
We are not your kind of people
Something in your make-up
Don't see eye to eye

We are not your kind of people
Don't want to be like you ever in our lives
We are not your kind of people
We find when you start talking
There's nothing but white noise

Running around tryin' to fit in and wanting to be loved
It doesn't take much
For someone to shut you down
When you built a shell, built an army in your mind
You can't sit still and you don't like hanging around the crowd
They don't understand

You dropped by as I was sleeping
You came to see the whole commotion
And when I woke I started laughing
The joke's on me for not believing
We are not your kind of people
Speak a different language
We see through your lies
We are not your kind of people
Won't be cast as demons
Creatures you despise

I know how to hurt, I know how to heal
I know what to show and what to conceal
I know when to talk and I know when to touch
No one ever died from wanting too much

The world is not enough
But it is such a perfect place to start, my love
And if you're strong enough
Together we can take the world apart, my love

People like us know how to survive
There's no point in living if you can't feel alive
We know when to kiss and we know when to kill
If we can't have it all, then nobody will

The world is not enough
But it is such a perfect place to start, my love
And if you're strong enough
Together we can take the world apart, my love

I feel safe
I feel scared
I feel ready
And yet unprepared

Hey boy, take a look at me
Let me dirty up your mind
I'll strip away your hard veneer
And see what I can find

The queerest of the queer
The strangest of the strange
The coldest of the cool
The lamest of the lame
The numbest of the dumb
I hate to see you here
You choke behind a smile
A fake behind the fear
The queerest of the queer

This is what he pays me for
I'll show you how it's done
You'll learn to love the pain you feel
Like father, like son

The queerest of the queer
Hide inside your head
The blindest of the blind
The deadest of the dead
You're hungry 'cause you starve
While holding back the tears
Choking on your smile
A fake behind the fear
The queerest of the queer
I know what's good for you

I would die for you
I've been dying just to feel you by my side
To know that you're mine
I will cry for you
I will cry for you
I will wash away your pain with all my tears
And drown your fear

I will pray for you
I will pray for you
I will sell my soul for something pure and true
Someone like you

See your face every place that I walk in
Hear your voice every time I am talking
You will believe in me
And I will never be ignored

I will burn for you
Feel pain for you
I will twist the knife and bleed my aching heart
And tear it apart
I will lie for you
Beg and steal for you
I will crawl on hands and knees until you see
You're just like me

Violate all the love that I'm missing
Blow away all the pain that I'm living
You will believe in me
And I can never be ignored

I would die for you
I would kill for you
I would steal for you
I'd do time for you

I'd sail ships for you

To be a part of you

Stop those voices in your head
They eat away your will
You've everything you need
Hate the way they make you weak
They bring you to your knees
And steal your power away

Girls talk shit when you're backed up against it
Don't believe in a word that they hear
And you can't do what it is that you want
Without some little bitch in your ear
And girls talk shit, making no bones about it
When you're something that they don't understand
When they see that you got caught with your pants down
When they see you got caught with your pants down

Buy into the things they say
You lose your common sense
You've everything you need
Love to bring you to your knees
And watch you as you bleed
And give your power away
Girls talk shit when you're backed up against it
Don't believe in a word that they hear
And you can't do what it is that you want
Without some little bitch in your ear
And girls talk shit, making no bones about it
When you're something that they don't understand
And you can't do what it is that you want
Without some little bitch in your ear
Girls talk shit, making no bones about it
When you're something that they don't understand
And you can't do what it is that you want
Without some little bitch in your ear
Girls talk shit when your confidence crashes
Girls talk shit when it falls to the floor
Girls talk shit when you're biting your nails down
To the quick, ’cause you feel insecure

When everything is going wrong
And you can't see the point of going on
Nothing in life is set in stone
There's nothing that can't be turned around
Nobody wants to feel alone
Everybody wants to love someone
Out of the tree, go pick a plum
Why can't we all just get along?

You free your mind in your androgyny

Than fruit hanging ripe upon the vine
There's never been an oyster so divine
A river deep that never runs dry

Desperate for a revolution
Some kind of spark
Some kind of connection
In these dangerous days
Come a little bit closer

Why we kill the things we love the most
Kill the things we love
Kill the things we love the most
Why we kill the things we love the most
Kill the things we love
Kill the things we love the most

And even though we're all messed up
We're still waiting for tomorrow
We're still aching for tomorrow
And even though our love is cruel
And even though our stars are crossed
You're the only thing worth fighting for
You're the only thing worth dying for
Don't wanna be dead to life
Don't wanna be dulled to extinction
Don't wanna be lost in dreams
Don't wanna be caught sleepwalking
Maybe I should break the chain
Maybe I should break the connection
Such strange little birds
Devoured by our obsessions

Can you love me for what I've become
Love me for what I
Said that I would not become
Can you love me for what I've become
Love me for what I
Said that I would not become
Cause they don't burn like I do
They don't burn like I do

And even though your love is cruel
And even though our stars are crossed
We're still waiting for tomorrow
We're still aching for tomorrow
And even though our love is doomed
And even though we're all messed up
You're the only thing worth fighting for
You're the only thing worth dying  for
And even though our love is doomed
Even though our love is doomed
Even though our love is doomed
Even though our love is doomed
Even though our love is doomed
Even though our love is doomed
Even though our love is doomed
You're the only thing worth fighting for
You're the only thing worth dying for5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I've been feeling so frustrated
I'll never be as great as
I want to be
Everyone that I run into
The ones you always seem so into
What's wrong with me?
They all seem to know exactly
What it is they want, they pass me
They smile as they go
So I work at staying patient
Good things come to those that wait
Or so they say

I'm so empty
You're all I'm thinking about, about
Oh oh, about, about
Oh oh oh, about, about
Oh oh oh, about, about

I get tired of trying
Ideas die on the vine
And I feel like a fake
I lie awake believing
That somehow I keep failing
I rail and I ache
At the monsters and the demons
I've wrestled with for eons
And I want to destroy
I'm so empty
You're all I talk about
Oh oh-out
You're all I talk about

Every day, every hour of the night
You're all I think about
Every day, every hour of the night
You're all I dream about
Every day, every hour of the night
You're all I think about
You're all I think about

I'm so empty
I'm so empty
I'm so empty
You're all I'm thinking about
About, about, oh oh oh, about
I'm so empty7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
