Thinkin' back, thinkin' of you
Summertime, think it was June
Yeah, think it was June
Laying back, head on the grass
Chewing gum, having some laughs
Yeah, having some laughs

You made me feel like the one
Made me feel like the one
The one
You made me feel like the one
Made me feel like the one
The one

Drinking back, drinking for two
Drinking with you
When drinking was new
Sleeping in the back of my car
We never went far
Didn't need to go far

You made me feel like the one
Made me feel like the one
The one
You made me feel like the one
Made me feel like the one
The one
I don't know where we are going now
I don't know where we are going now

Wake up call, coffee and juice
Rememberin' you
What happened to you?
I wonder if we'll meet again
Talk about life since then
Talk about why did it end

You made me feel like the one
Made me feel like the one
The one
You made me feel like the one
Made me feel like the one
The one

I don't know where we are going now
I don't know where we are going now

I've been down, and I'm wondering why
These little black clouds keep walking around
With me
With me
It wastes time, and I'd rather be high
Think I'll walk me outside and buy a rainbow smile
But be free
They're all free

So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home

I look around at a beautiful life
I've been the upper side of down, been the inside of out
But we breathe
We breathe
I want a breeze and an open mind
I wanna swim in the ocean, wanna take my time
For me
All me
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home


So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home

One o'clock in the morning
And I'm leaving from the club
My friends are having a party
Kind of feel I've had enough

At two o'clock in the morning
Sure I'm at the party house
I meet the roommate getting some water
She got a baby in her stomach
Oh oh oh oh oah oh
Oh oh oh oh oah oh
Oh oh oh oh oah oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Three o'clock in the morning
We hear a scream above the sounds
Looks like the baby in her belly
Thinks it's time to come on out

Four o'clock in the morning
I'm driving all over the road
I swerve a dog on the high street
And crash into the post
Oh oh oh oh oah oh
Oh oh oh oh oah oh
Oh oh oh oh oah oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

She can't wait any longer
I got to help her come into the world
The police try to arrest us
But then they see the baby girl

Five o'clock in the morning
I'm drinking coffee on the ward
I take a walk in to see her
Tells me 'bout the dad that took off
Oh oh oh oh oah oh
Oh oh oh oh oah oh
Oh oh oh oh oah oh
All in one night
All in one night

Six o'clock in the morning
And now we're 22 months along
She asked me to be the daddy
And get married when it snows
Oh oh oh oh oah oh
Oh oh oh oh oah oh
Oh oh oh oh oah oh
All in one night
All in one night
All in one night
All in one night, one night
All in one night
Oh oh oh oh oah oh

Standing at the bus stop with my shopping in my hands
And I'm overhearing elder ladies
As the rumours start to fly
You can hear them in the school yard, in the scrap yard
In the chip shop, in the phone box
In the pool hall, at the shoe store
Every corner turn around
It started with a school girl
Who was running
Running home to her Mam and Dad
Told them she was playing, in the change room of the local football side
They said "tell us again", she told them again, "tell us the truth", they find it hard to believe
Cause he taught our boy Steve, he even trained me, taught our John who's a father of three

Only takes one tree, to make a thousand matches
Only takes one match, to burn a thousand trees
A thousand trees

You see it in the classroom
In the swimming pool
Where the match stick men are made
At the scout's hall, at the football
Where the wise we trust are paid
They all honour his name, he did a lot for the game
Got his name knocked up above the sports ground gates
But they're ripping them down, stamping the ground
Picture gathers dust behind the bar in the lounge
Only takes one tree, to make a thousand matches
Only takes one match, to burn a thousand trees
A thousand trees

Wake up, and smell the rain
Shake up, he's back to stay
Hasn't been on a holiday
Growing seeds don't believe
Why he's been away

From the school yard, changing room
Playing fields, bathroom
Phone box, office blocks
Corners turn around
They keep doubting the flame, tossing the blame
Got his name knocked up above the sports ground gates
And they're ripping them down, stamping the ground
Picture gathers dust in the bar

Only takes one tree, to make a thousand matches
Only takes one match, to burn A thousand trees
A thousand trees
A thousand trees
A thousand trees1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Do you remember the light in the flame?
It was a birthday party of someone
Then you told me your name
For you were one in a million

I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
So come on over

I walked you home in the rain
Speaking the same language
You were running around in my brain
Then you sent me a message
It said…

I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
So come on over
I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
So come on over
I know we did some wrong
You told me that now
When I came to you
That you were with someone
If God messed up
With so much stuff
Like living a loaded gun
But now that I'm out of my mind with you
We got that day in the sun

I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
So come on over

I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
So come on over
So come on over
So come on over
Come on over
I wanna get lost with you
I wanna get lost with you
Wanna get lost with you
Yeah-yeah

San Francisco Bay, past pier thirty-nine
Early p.m, can't remember what time
Got the waiting cab stopped at the red light
Address, unsure of but it turned out just right

It started straight off: Coming here is Hell
That's his first words, we asked what he meant
He said, "Where you from?" we told him a lot
We take a holiday, is this what you want?

To have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Lie around all day, have a drink to chase
Yourself and tourists, yeah, that's what I hate
He said, "We're going wrong", we've all become the same
We dress the same ways, only our accents change

So have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Swim in the ocean, that be my dish
I drive around all day and kill the processed fish
It's all money gum, no artists anymore
You're only in it now to it make more, more and more

So have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Yeah you believe you’re the king of the jungle
You got the t-shirt, do you know how the song goes?
You’re looking good but the fact is you’re lazy
But people love you ‘cause you’re funny and crazy
7-11, buy a six pack o’beer
If there’s a party you’re the last one to leave it
It’s not too late, we can stop all the dreamin’
Get out this town, look around, we don’t need it

Hell and heaven, they can wait for you
So go and do all the things that you want to do

(We don’t belong anywhere)
So set me free, C’est La Vie
I said, come on pretty baby, take a chance on me
(We don’t belong anywhere) I said shame on me cause I didn’t see
That you were looking at me baby by the Ferris wheel

I know you’re cool but you think that you’re chocolate
Get off my nerves, cause I still got a soft spot
You look at me and think I got all the answers
Maybe I do, but I’m scared takin’ chances
Boat in our bottle, but we ain't sailing nowhere
Rip out the cork, get the wind into our hair
Get off the train in the rain at the station
Knock back a drink, cause we think the boat’s sinkin’


(We don’t belong anywhere)
So set me free C’est la vie
I said, come on pretty baby, take a dance with me
(We don’t belong anywhere) I said, a shame on me cause I didn’t see
That you were looking at me baby by the Ferris wheel
(We don’t belong anywhere) I said a stand by me, stick around with me
Cause it’s a long walk back to where we just been
(We don’t belong anywhere) I said, a hey there baby so you’re banking on me
I just I wish I never found her but hey C’est la vie

I said they’re playing our song on the radio
And we’re singing out loud, all the words that we know
And it’s a Long Tall Sally pissing off Peggy Sue
Oh it’s about me and you cause it’s time that we grew
And you said yeah yeah yeah come along with me
And then you think all the things that you want to see
I said a woah pretty baby come and take my hand
I’m gonna shake you all night, baby yes I can, woah!
Such as life in the rear view mirror
The open road up ahead is the future
Time came round and wrecked our place
But when I look back now I got a smile on my face

(We don’t belong anywhere)
Come on baby take a chance with me
Stick around on the town if you wanna see
(We don’t belong anywhere) We don’t belong anywhere is what she said to me
So come on, take a dance and spin around with me
(We don’t belong anywhere) She said shout now baby, set me free C’est la vie
I said I’ll stand by me, stick around with me
(We don’t belong anywhere) And when the street lights fall, you can buy my beer
Cause when the morning light comes, I’ll be gone C’est la vie
Yeah yeah (We don’t belong anywhere)
We don’t belong anywhere (We don’t belong anywhere)
We don’t belong anywhere (We don’t belong anywhere)
We don’t belong anywhere (We don’t belong anywhere)
Set me free!
We don’t belong anywhere
We don’t belong anywhere
We don’t belong anywhere

Thinking about quitting
Think it's time now
Thinking it's all over
Quiet in my mind
Everybody's laughing
Everybody's sure
Nothing seems likely
Nothing's unknown

Did you ever feel like everything's falling?
To fly like an eagle into the dawn and
You know I always feel like the blinds are drawing
To fly like an eagle and dare to reborn and

Hey, hey, my, my
Everything's gonna be alright
Hey, hey, my, my
Everything's gonna be just fine

Maybe I'm grieving
Maybe I'm dead
Maybe I'm leaving
My heart's like lead
Something feels missing
Something ain't right
Remember first kissing
My heart felt wide
Did you ever feel like everything's falling?
To fly like an eagle into the dawn and
You know I always feel like the blinds are drawing
To fly like an eagle and dare to reborn and

Hey, hey, my, my
Everything's gonna be alright
Hey, hey, my, my
Everything's gonna be just fine

Oh, nothing last forever
Oh, nothing suits me better
Oh, I don't feel so clever
But I'm tryin' to improve, oh-oh-oh

So hey, hey, my, my
Everything's gonna be alright
Hey, hey, my, my
Yeah, everything's gonna be just fine

So hey, hey, my, my
Everything's gonna be alright

Ever seen a blind man cross the road
Trying to make the other side?
Ever seen a young girl growing old
Trying to make herself a bride?

So what becomes of you, my love?
When they have finally stripped you of
The handbags and the gladrags
That your poor old granddad
Had to sweat to buy you, baby

Once I was a young man
And all I thought I had to do was smile
Well, you are still a young girl
And you've bought everything in style

So once you think you're in, you're out
'Cause you don't mean a single thing without
The handbags and the gladrags
That your poor old granddad
Had to sweat to buy you
Sing a song of six-pence for your sake
And drink a bottle full of rye
Four and twenty blackbirds in a cake
And bake 'em all in a pie

They told me you missed school today
So what I suggest you just throw them all away
The handbags and the gladrags
That your poor old granddad
Had to sweat to buy
They told me you missed school today
So what I suggest you just throw them all away
The handbags and the gladrags
That your poor old granddad
Had to sweat to buy youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh the graffiti on the train oh no
Rolled in to her life
Oh the graffiti on the train
Oh
Sets out he left his lover sleeping
Rain falls he's drowning in his secret
Wet streets are quiet as a church hall
Last house where children kick the football
Crossroads his heart is beating faster
Getting close to asking her the question
"Marry me" he wants to paint the words on
The night train he's hiding with his spray can
Tonight he's gonna ride
When the paint is done and dried oh come on
Oh oh oh the graffiti on the train

Oh she'll never be the same oh no
Rolled in to her life
Oh the graffiti on the train oh
Day breaks his lover yawns and wakes up
Sips her cup and dusts her face in make up
Platform she hears the people whisper
Someone died they surfed the train and slipped up
Train comes the coach she's always used to
The doors read "Marry me I love you"
Heart stops ecstatic and suspicious
She makes the call but he don't pick the phone up
The train sped down the line
It was last train he would ride oh no

Oh she'll never be the same oh no

Every time that I see her
A lightning bolt fills the room
The underbelly of Paris
She sings her favourite tune
She’ll drink you under the table
She show you a trick or two
But every time that I left her
I miss the things she would do

She was the one, for me
She opened my eyes, to see
She was the one, for me
Well alright
It was a cold September
Before the Indian Summer
That’s the thing I remember
When she gave me her number
Went from station to station
On a train ‘cross the nation
And the rain of November
That’s the time that we ended

She was the one, for me
Oh alright
Vodka with coca-cola
Cocaine tucked in her shoes
Cigarettes over coffee
Her halo slipped to a noose
Take the slow boat to China
You fly it right ’round the moon
She could take it or leave it
I knew it had to end soon

She was the one, for me
She opened my eyes, to see
She was the one, for me
Well alright
It was a cold September
Before the Indian Summer
That’s the thing I remember
When she gave me her number
Went from station to station
On a train ‘cross the nation

There's no mistake, I smell that smell
It's that time of year again
I can taste the air

The clocks go back, railway track
Something blocks the line again
And the train runs late for the first time

A pebble beach, we're underneath
A pier that's just been painted red
Where I heard the news for the first time

And all the friends lay down the flowers
Sit on the banks and drink for hours
Talk of the way they saw him last
Local boy in the photograph
Today

He'll always be 23
Yet the train runs on and on
Past the place they found his clothing
There's no mistake, I smell that smell
It's that time of year again
I can taste the air

The clocks go back, railway track
Something blocks the line again
And the train runs late for the first time today

And all the friends lay down the flowers
Sit on the banks and drink for hours

You line them up
Look at your shoes
Your hang names on your wall
Then you shoot them all
You fly around in planes
That bring you down
To meet me who loves you
Like me crashing to the ground

Are you so lonely?
You don't even know me
But you'd like to stone me

Mr Writer, why don't you tell it like it is?
Why don't you tell it like it really is
Why don't you tell it how it really is
Before you go on home?

I used to treat you right
Give you my time
But when I'd turn my back on you
Then you do what you do
You've just enough, in my own view
Education to perform
I'd like to shoot you all
And then you go home
With you on your own
What do you really know?

Mr Writer, why don't you tell it like it is?

We wait to wake to get a ride in the rain
Buy a ticket they can check we can claim
So we don't spend what's our own
For a seat a place to stop a green light
A red cross they run around naked
Doing old things like the ones before
Wait for a break so you can take a little
Something that'll make your next break
Come along a little quicker than the one before
Wait for an answer spy a sweet dancer
As she walks from the door of the hall
Wish you waited for your wedding vows
So hurry up and wait
But what's worth waiting for?
So hurry up and wait
But what's worth waiting for?
We wait to get warm the car starts
From cold stall to make the first move
Magazines made the rules to make us lose
For your dream man the house you could both plan
The car in the sales add the wet dream
With the man you wish that you had
So hurry up and wait
But what's worth waiting for?
So hurry up and wait
But what's worth waiting for?
A watched pot never boils sugar
Seconds to dissolve see your appetite
Lost foods relevance is lost inside
We wait to get there and when we get there
We wait around for anyone to
Tell us what we even got there for
So hurry up and wait
But what's worth waiting for?
So hurry up and wait
But what's worth waiting for?

Say yeah

He calls her up and out she comes and hustles

Long digging
Gone fishing
Love drinking
The bartender and the thief are lovers
Steal what they need like sisters and brothers
Met in a church a night to remember
Robbing the graves of bodies dismembered
He watched the lesbian talk
She kissed and groped but mostly talked in lust
Crushed

We all face the same way
Still it takes all day
I take a look to my left
Pick out the worst and the best
She paints her lip
Greasy and thick
Another mirror stare
And she's going where?

Another office affair
To kill an unborn scare?
You talk dirty to a priest?
It makes them human at least
But is she running away
To start a brand new day?
Or is she going home?
Why's she driving alone?

Is anyone going anywhere?
Everyone's gotta be somewhere

She got a body in the boot
Or just bags full of food?
Those are model's legs
But are they women's are they men's?
She shouts down the phone
Missed a payment on the loan
She gotta be above the rest
Keeping up with the best
Is anyone going anywhere?
Everyone's gotta be somewhere

Waits tables for a crook?
Who wrote a hardback book?
To teach kids how to read?
Or sell your body on the street?
A nurse without a job?
Another uptown snob?
But have I got you all wrong?
One look and you were gone

Is anyone going anywhere?

I flew all the way today
Back from LA
You tie your hair in a red band bow
When you greet me by the gate
Sip and stir from your coffee cup
And break bread crumbs on the floor
I fight my head 'cause I wanna drink
But I want you so much more
Oh what's the fuss all about?
I knew all the way today
Back to our place
You didn't care if I said too much
I could see that by your face
You sleep and stir when I pick you up
And drop your neck scarf on the floor
I fight my mind cause I wanna think
That I'll be here evermore
Oh what's the fuss all about?
Oh what's the fuss all about?
The bell rings aloud in the school yard sun
Young boys all they wanna do is run
The trees and the leaves and they blow in the breeze
And the blossoms are pale pink, the young girls sneeze
The swings in the park and the ghosts in the dark
The truths and the dare and the secrets we share
The things that we learn and the things that we earn
Embarrassing days and mistakes that we make
Jet streams in the sky
You're gone in the blink of an eye
Heavenly hugs and the shoulders you shrug
The bully, the boss and the priest and his cross
The letters we write and the wrongs you can't right
The space that we need in the loneliest weeks
Blows in the wind
Repenting our sins
The games that we play and the changes we make
The love and the light and the smiles you ignite
Skin on skin
The life that we chase, it feels like a race
To get to the place with the pride and the grace
It's hard to replace the touch of your face
When you're so far away
Are you lost? Are you found?
On this merry go round?
What's all the fuss about?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
