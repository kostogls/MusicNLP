When our time is up
When our lives are done
Will we say we've had our fun?
Will we make our mark this time?
Will we always say we tried?

Standing on the rooftops
Everybody scream your heart out
Standing on the rooftops
Everybody scream your heart out
Standing on the rooftops
Everybody scream your heart out
This is all we got now
Everybody scream your heart out

All the love I've met
I have no regrets
If it all ends now, I'm set
Will we make our mark this time?
Will we always say we tried?

Standing on the rooftops
Everybody scream your heart out
Standing on the rooftops

Never gonna regret
(Watching every sunset)
We'll listen to your heartbeat

Standing on the rooftops

To every broken heart in here
Love was once a part, but now it's disappeared
She told me that it's all part of the choices that you make
Even when you think you're right, you have to give to take

But there's still tomorrow
Forget the sorrow
And I can be on the last train home
Watch it pass the day
As it fades away
No more time to care
No more time today

But we sing
If we're going nowhere
Yeah, we sing
If it's not enough
And we sing
Sing without a reason to ever fall in love

I wonder if you're listening
Picking up on the signals sent back from within
Sometimes it feels like I don't really know what's goin' on
Time and time again it seems like everything is wrong in here
But there's still tomorrow
Forget the sorrow
And I can be on the last train home
Watch it pass the day
As it fades away
No more time to care
No more time today

But we sing
If we're going nowhere
Yeah, we sing
If it's not enough
And we sing
Sing without a reason to ever fall in love

But we sing if we're going nowhere
Yeah, we sing if it's not enough
And we sing
Sing without a reason to ever fall in love

But we sing
If we're going nowhere
Yeah, we sing
If it's not enough
And we sing
Sing without a reason to never fall in love
To never fall in love again
(To never fall in love again)
(To never fall in love again)3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Got it all too high
Got it figured out
Wanna do whatever
Laugh until September
And I seem to think that you were once here with me
Maybe I was wrong
You were moving on

And I sit and wonder, falling under
Get my way or nothing will move on
Everyone has gone

You feel so empty but I've got me a friend
And I like it

And I know you say I can't care for someone
But are you that clever that you smile forever?
Is it summer yet cause I just don't feel it
Maybe it's a treaty, maybe you are not her

And I sit and wonder, falling under
Get my way or nothing will move on
Everyone has gone
You feel so empty but I've got me a friend
And I like it
Say now, got it for all of me
And do IEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yesterday I lost my closest friend
Yesterday I wanted time to end
I wonder if my heart will ever mend
I just let you slip away
4 AM forever
Maybe I'll never see you smile again
Maybe you thought that it was all pretend;
All these words that I could never say
I just let them slip away
4 AM forever
Why don't you hear me when I'm calling out to you (to you)
Why don't you listen when I try to make it through (to you)
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, you never know
Hold a little tighter
4 AM forever
Maybe one day when I can move along
Maybe someday when you can hear this song
You won't let it slip away
4 AM forever
And I'd wish the sun would never come
It's 4 AM and you are gone
I hope you know you're letting go
It's 4 AM and I'm alone
Why don't you hear me when I'm calling out to you (to you)
Why don't you listen when I try to make it through (to you)
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, you never know
Hold a little tighter
Why don't you hear me when I'm calling out to you (to you)

With you it's never good enough
Because you want the stuff that could change your future
You're lost amongst a sea of chance
And now the more you dance just gets you sinkin' deeper
It's okay, don't apologize
You don't know what you're striving for and you never seem to try
It's too early, go live your lie
Keep on moving, it's time to
Ride, ride, ride, now it's time to
Ride, ride, ride
Everything seems tempting but nothing comes for free
I often wonder how you drive when the road's too dark to see
It's too early, it's time to
(Ride, ride, ride)
We light the fire to watch it burn
But when it comes your turn all that's left is embers
You ran this race with no real heart, yeah right back at the start
You'd already lost it
It's okay, don't apologize
You don't know what you're striving for and you never seem to try
It's too early, go live your lie
Keep on moving, it's time to
Ride, ride, ride, now its time to

I often wonder how you drive when the road's too dark to see
It's too early, it's time to

Everything feels tempting when you don't know who to be
I often wonder how you feel when you're lyin' next to me
It's too early, it's time to
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so what?
Yeah, yeah, and after all that time
Yeah, yeah, no answers

End to it all
Falling down
Losing touch with everyone who ever stood their ground
If you could then I know I do too
Lost inside a maze of problems with you
Chorus:
Is it so hard
Every time I say
Won't you come and fight with me
Because if I thought I'd win you
Every word I'd say
Would come out wrong
And make me look the other way
You know if I thought I'd win you, time and time again
And if I did we won't be friends
And tell me I'm brought down again
Never the one I explain
Can't you warn
Don't you lie
There've been times when I've felt good because you're hurt inside
No that's not true
I'm just acting tough
I don't know what it is I'm feeling I don't know if you are enough
Chorus:
Is it so hard
Every time I say
Won't you come and fight with me
Because if I thought I'd win you
Every word I'd say
Would come out wrong
And make you look the other way
You know if I thought I'd win you, time and time again
And if I did we won't be friends
And tell me I'm brought down again
Never the one I explain
So answer that
You never know
Don't want it back
It seems to go
It's so hard, so hard
Cause I feel alive
And it feels all right
Keep on telling me
That it's over please
And I feel the warmth
Lying in the sun
It's so hot in here
It's the clothes I wear
Don't you even ask
I won't let you pass
Though my guard is up
And your soul is kept
Could I? Should I? Would I?
Could I? Should I? Would I?
Could I? Should I? Would I?
Could I? Should I? Would I?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Bite that lip
Cause your tongue is a gun and your brain is the trigger
Fire at will
Oh I doubt that mouth could get any bigger
You live in hypocrisy, those skies are always sunny
You're never gonna be a threat to anybody
You're lying, you're lying
You're gonna be the one left crying
If you bring a gun, baby, we'll bring an arsenal
If you think we're done, baby, we'll bring it, we'll sing it
Open your eyes and see you are outnumbered, honey
You're never gonna be a threat to anybody
You'll never get this dance tonight
So split, oh you can run till you're done but the shame will never leave ya
Had your fun, was it worth all the time getting people to believe ya?
Open your eyes and see it never was that funny
You're never gonna be a threat to anybody
You're lying, you're lying
You're gonna be the one left crying
If you bring a gun, baby, we'll bring an arsenal

Somebody told me that I'd always have to bow
If that was true I would have fallen apart by now
The more you think, the less you act their way
So can you hear this, the fake sound of progress?
Never reason with a fool, but is that unkind?
Looks like I've lost my mind once again
I know it all sounds so contrived, but it's got to me
You know I've got to be more than this
Don't frown, don't scorn, cause I walk a different street to you
You look so worn, I bet that life has got you blown
But it will never get to me
Somebody told me that I'd always have to bow
If that was true I would have fallen apart by now
The more you think, the less you act their ways
So can you hear this, the fake sound of progress?
And I feel the way you hold, hold me back from this
Chances that I've missed, now they're gone
Apathy is all I sense, the feeling's too intense
Sitting on the fence and can't decide
Don't frown, don't scorn, cause I walk a different street to you
You look so worn, I bet that life is has got you blown
No body will ever get to me
Somebody told me that I always have to bow
If that was true I would have fallen apart by now
The more you think, the less you act their ways
So can you hear this, the fake sound of progress?
All these words that I accounted for, never fear another day
Always charged but I need more, make me take away
Tell me now, can you hear the sound
Of all these people falling down
Growing back into the ground let me smile again...
SWING IT
Dah dah dah dah (yeahyeah sounds like) dah dah dah dah
(all these words that I accounted for, I'll never fear another day always charged and I want more, make me take away, all these words that I accounted for, I'll never fear another day, it makes, me, take, away)
Somebody told me that I'd always have to bow
If that was true I would have fallen apart by now
The more you think, the less you act their ways
So can you hear this, the fake sound of progress?
Yeah yeah yeah progress

The Friday sun bears down again
As we drive with our friends
And on these longest days we spend
All the time trying to pretend
That our stories could be true
Wanting to be cool
The settin' sunset's day is through
If only we knew
And we all sit 'round here in our home town
Listen to the waves as they all crash down
And watch the fire as it slowly burns away
Glowin' embers fly across the sky you're

Here by my side, in my summer, our last summer
The world passes by in my summer, our last summer
The light makes shadows fall, surrounded by each other
I let you watch it all, the view from our last summer
The view from our last summer

We trace the sun across the sky
And we laugh 'til we cry
Always so hard to say goodbye
(Goodbye)
And we all sit 'round here in our home town
It's so good like this, these are times we'll miss
The memories, I hope will never fade
Glowin' embers fly across the sky you're
Here by my side, in my summer, our last summer
The world passes by in my summer, our last summer
The light makes shadows fall, surrounded by each other
I let you watch it all, the view from our last summer
The view from our last summer

I would stop time to stay with you
I would stop time so we don't move
I would stop time
I would stop time
I would stop time to keep you

Here by my side, in my summer, our last summer
The world passes by in my summer, our last summer
The light makes shadows fall, surrounded by each other
I let you watch it all, the view from our last summerEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh, take these stones away
Start a brand new story
I'll make it through each day
Singing death or glory
Lord won't answer me
I won't let it bring me down
I know these clouds are gray
That I am living under
I know I'll be okay
With the rain or thunder
I hear it calling me
I won't march into the sound
Ooooooohhhhhhhhh, Woah
I just get this feeling
You're holding me down
And these answers I'm needing
I guess they're being smothered by the sound
Of all this emotion
And all of this hate
Still I keep searching for something to put my faith in, to find my place so I keep singing
Oh, take these stones away
Start a brand new story
I'll make it through each day
Singing death or glory
Lord won't answer me
I won't let it bring me down
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhh, Woah
Hold on
Hold on
We'll move along
Where we belong
Where we belong
My heart, my soul
I don't need a vision
I'd like to embrace
And not only false promises, hopes and wishes
To find my place
So I keep singing
Oh, take these stones away
Start a brand new story
I'll make it through each day
Singing death or glory
Lord won't answer me
I won't let it bring me down
Oooooooooohhhhhhhhhh, Woah
Where we belong
Where we belong
My heart, my soul
We stand alone
Hold on
Hold on
Where we belong
My heart, my song
We stand alone
Hold on
Hold on
Where we belong
My heart, my song
We stand alone
Hold on
Hold on
Where we belong
My heart, my soul

Where do I begin, with this life we're livin' in

Priced and placed upon a shelf

They thought they'd win, but now they know
You ain't the first to come and try
Won't be the last to say goodbye

Stand down this fight cannot be won
It's over before it's begun
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
Who's on your side, you're still having fun
You ain't the first to come and die
Digging these graves for miles and miles
Through everything we still achieve
In bringing all our enemies
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down

Start today, now show us how you feel
Make your way, it's time to choose
Have my say, I know, I know what I see
Have my say, they think you lose
For all this to mean so much to me
For all this, you make a move
Pass you by, it's all in this life you have
Pass you by, goodbye to you
1, 2, 3, 4

Move
If you don't stop there, you'll make it through
Stop dreaming, start something
When it's in your hands, just start anew

It's okay to use your ability
You must know, it's hard to choose
Time will tell, it's hard 'cause the way you feel
Means you always seem to lose
Seize the day, the one that you left behind
Seems so strange that you don't move
Frozen still in front of your own lights
Win or lose, its time to choose
Move
If you don't stop there, you'll make it through
Stop dreaming, start something
When it's in your hands, just start anew1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Her eyes are open like a book
Her fingers stroke her hair to look
A moment feels so out of place
This will left standing in disgrace
Paint your fingernails at night
Style your hair in the bathroom light
Hatred never looked this good
Whoever thought it could
I don't wanna wait or leave it up to fate
'Cause I just wanna watch you all night
Screaming
Andie, you're a goonie
Don't you wake me up, I don't want this dream to
Andie, you're a goonie
Don't you wake me up, I don't want this dream to end
One kiss those lips could never lie
But I know something isn't right
Don't be fooled my friends aside
'Cause I see nothing in those eyes
All said and done
This won't be fun
Make no mistake
Those smiles are fake
Don't wanna wait or leave it up to fate

Go
So here we go again
Another time but it feels the same
Got sick of waiting here
Set sail on concrete waves
No survivors left to save
Too late for the walking dead
We'll make it on our own
Breathing our own air
'Cause no one else will care and
No one really knows
Need more room to shout
Time is running out
But even through your doubts
We will still be here
(We will still be here)
Seeing all I see
And I still kill
Still kill the old way
I'm gonna die before I fall
Don't try to save me
Moving on to a different place
People hide but I see their face
The one that's full of hate
Their apathy's not affecting us
Maybe they ride on a different bus
Realize that we'll never change
We'll make it on our own
Breathing our own air
'Cause no one else will care and
No one really knows
Need more room to shout
Time is running out
But even through your doubts
We will still be here
(We will still be here)
Seeing all I see
And I still kill
Still kill the old way
I'm gonna die before I fall
Don't try to save me
Hoaohhh woah (x3)
Last time I'll fall
Hoaohhh woah
Hoaohhh woah woah
This is the last time I'll fall
Seeing all I see
And I still kill

When the trees start to sway
And the wind makes them move
I can tell that
You don't know

To all the fights I've conquered and beyond
The times have changed and I will now move over slowly
But through it all I still feel lost without you
Hard to find a new soul, as silence takes its toll

(You sway)
When you are lost
(You sway)
When you don't know
(You sway)
When all you want is to find home

As the light pours in
Feel the volume of the sky
Mark your place in time with another question why
Tiny flickers in the night, always looking to be right
To all the fights I've conquered and beyond
The times have changed and I will now move over slowly
But through it all I still feel lost without you
Hard to find a new soul, as silence takes its toll

(You sway)
When you are lost
(You sway)
When you don't know
(You sway)
When all you want is to find home
(You sway)
When you are lost
(You sway)
When you don't know
(You sway)
When all you want is to find home
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Take, break, shake it off, Wake from your slumber
Hey kids live to shock, Here comes the thunder
Time to make a choice, When you are older
Will this all be enough for you baby?
I remember when, When we were younger
Hate, Love came and went, Still had each other
Young hearts, exploding minds of jealous lovers
Are you singing with me?
They tell you Jesus walks but baby He'll just walk away
No matter what you do you're gonna have to fight someday
Fake smiles, seen them all, I just don't need it
Aim, fire, watch them fall, no warnings heeded
Fall down, get back up, ignore the bleeding
Every street, every town will follow you into the
Right fight every night, just keep on swinging
Stand fast hold your ground, you're doing great kid
Can't you hear the crowd, everyone's singing
Yeah you're singing with me
They tell you Jesus walks but baby He'll just walk away
No matter what you do you're gonna have to fight someday
Cause baby when it's you and me, we don't need guns to fight a war
We will never lose
If it's you and me, we've got a chance to live for more
We could make it through, singing
Oh no here we go, I'm not the only one who seems to know, you might get lonely
I know it's a lot to take in but, you've got to sing it with me
They tell you Jesus walks but baby He'll just walk away
No matter what you do you're gonna have to fight someday
Cause baby when it's you and me, we don't need guns to fight a war
We will never lose
If it's you and me, we've got a chance to live for more
We could make it through, singing
Woah woah hear it across the night till your ears are ringing
Woah woah we'll never give up the fight, we'll never stop singing
Hey now, dry those eyes, you will recover
No more compromise, for one-another
Stay strong fall and rise when it's all over
You'll be singing with me
They tell you Jesus walks but baby He'll just walk away
No matter what you do you're gonna have to fight someday
Cause baby when it's you and me, we don't need guns to fight a war
We will never lose
If it's you and me, we've got a chance to live for more
We could make it through,singing
Woah woah hear it across the night till your ears are ringing
Woah woah We'll never give up the fight, we'll never stop singing
Woah!! We'll never stop singing...
Woah!! Never stop singing...
Will this all be enough for you baby?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
