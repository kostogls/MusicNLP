If I had to, I would put myself right beside you
So let me ask, "Would you like that? Would you like that?"
And I don't mind if you say this love is the last time
So now I'll ask, "Do you like that? Do you like that?" (No!)

Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be

Try to find out what makes you tick
As I lie down, sore and sick
Do you like that, do you like that?
There's a fine line between love and hate
And I don't mind, just let me say
That I like that, I like that

Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
As I burn another page, as I look the other way
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be
Desperate, I will crawl
Waiting for so long
No love, there is no love
Die for anyone
What have I become?

Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
As I burn another page, as I look the other way

Days reborn
Fight with folded hands
Pain left below
The lifeless live again

Run, run, run
Red cold river
Run, run, run
Red cold river

I can't feel anything at all
This life has left me cold and damned
I can't feel anything at all
This love has led me to the end

Stay reformed
Erase this perfect world
Hate left below
The dark stray dog of war

Run, run, run
Red cold river
Run, run, run
Red cold river
I can't feel anything at all
This life has left me cold and damned
I can't feel anything at all
This love has led me to the end

Will the faithful be rewarded
When we come to the end?
Will I miss the final warning
From the lie that I have lived?
Is there anybody calling?
I can see the soul within
And I am not worthy
I am not worthy of this

Are you with me after all?
Why can't I hear you?
Are you with me through it all?
Then why can't I feel you?

Stay with me, don't let me go
Because there's nothing left at all
Stay with me, don't let me go
Until the ashes of Eden fall

Will the darkness fall upon me
When the air is growing thin?
Will the light begin to pull me
To its everlasting will?
I can hear the voices haunting
There is nothing left to fear
And I am still calling
I am still calling to you
Are you with me after all?
Why can't I hear you?
Are you with me through it all?
Then why can't I feel you?

Stay with me, don't let me go
Because there's nothing left at all
Stay with me, don't let me go
Until the ashes of Eden fall

Don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go

Why can't I hear you?
Stay with me, don't let me go
Because there's nothing left at all
Stay with me, don't let me go
Until the ashes of Eden fall
Heaven above me
Take my hand
(Stay with me, don't let me go)
Shine until there's nothing left but you
Heaven above me
Take my hand

Shine until there's nothing left but you22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Here I stand
Helpless and left for dead

Close your eyes
So many days go by
Easy to find what's wrong
Harder to find what's right

I believe in you
I can show you that
I can see right through
All your empty lies
I won't stay long
In this world so wrong

Say goodbye
As we dance with the Devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye
As we dance with the Devil tonight

Trembling
Crawling across my skin
Feeling your cold, dead eyes
Stealing the life of mine
I believe in you
I can show you that
I can see right through
All your empty lies
I won't last long
In this world so wrong

Say goodbye
As we dance with the Devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye
As we dance with the Devil tonight
Hold on
Hold on (Oh)

Don't you dare look at him in the eye

It must have been inside my head
I lost the hope that I have left
And now at last it comes to pass
We sleep, we dream, we have no less
Along the path we lost our way
It’s all a game that I must play
And now the weak that fall
Return to ash, defeated after all

Fade away to the wicked world we left
And I become the dark of you
Say a prayer for the wounded heart within
As I become the dark of you

Let go
When all has come to life
We live, we breathe, we die
They call me to the light
Forever lost in time
With every dream we find
We feed, we burn, we lie
The fall of humankind
The everlasting light
Fade away to the wicked world we left
And I become the dark of you
Say a prayer for the wounded heart within
As I become the dark of you

Let go
When all has come to life
We live, we breathe, we die
They call me to the light
Forever lost in time
With every dream we find
We feed, we burn, we lie

Fade away to the wicked world we left
And I become the dark of you
Say a prayer for the wounded heart within
As I become the dark of you

I see nothing in your eyes
And the more I see, the less I like
Is it over yet?
In my head
I know nothing of your kind
And I won't reveal your evil mind
Is it over yet?
I can't win

So, sacrifice yourself
And let me have what's left
I know that I can find
The fire in your eyes
I'm going all the way
Get away, please

You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be
You got to fight just to make it through
'Cause I will be the death of you

This will be all over soon (This will all be over soon)
Pour the salt into the open wound
Is it over yet?
Let me in
So, sacrifice yourself
And let me have what's left
I know that I can find
The fire in your eyes
I'm going all the way
Get away, please

You take the breath right out of me
You left a hole where my heart should be
You got to fight just to make it through
'Cause I will be the death of you

I'm praying
Realize
Start hating

You left a hole where my heart should be

I can feel the animal within
I chain the beast and crawl inside myself
I hear the call of violence
I sleep no more and die again
I lost it all

Carry me through this world alive
I feel no more this suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf and shed my skin

I can see the devil closing in
I choke the breath that dies to cry for help
I feel the pull of gravity
I bleed no more and rise again
I lost it all

Carry me through this world alive
I feel no more this suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf and shed my skin
It's no longer a human
It's a beast, unmerciful, ferocious, fearless
You're a madman tampering with nature
Every man, a vicious animal

Carry me through this world alive
I feel no more this suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf and shed my skin

Every endless word
I have nothing here
Sick of all that was
Tired of all that is
Every hated love
I have broken in
Sick of fucking up
Tired of falling in

And all that I regret
I have before, I will again

It's over now
Are you running away?
I come apart
As I lie in your way
It's in my blood
Let the sky fall down
I won't let go
My oblivion

Counting every breath
I am my own fear
Nothing ever was
Nothing ever is
Every halo lost
I am worn within
Nothing left to hurt
Nothing left to live
And all that I regret
I have before, I will again

It's over now
Are you running away?
I come apart
As I lie in your way
It's in my blood
Let the sky fall down
I won't let go
My oblivion

Face the monster I've become
I'm falling down
Hate won't let me go
In the ground, we rise to burn
I'm caving in
Life won't let me live
Forgive my heart

It's in my blood

Life will come our way
It has only just begun
The world will die alone
The frail will fall below
Time will take our place
We return it back to one
The calm before the cold
The long and lonely road

Look for the light that leads me home

Tired of feeling lost
Tired of letting go
Tear the whole world down
Tear the whole world down
Failure

Drive the cloud away
We will fall from last to none
The dark before the dawn
The war will carry on
Look for the light that leads me home

Tired of feeling lost
Tired of letting go
Tear the whole world down
Tear the whole world down
Tired of wasted breath
Tired of nothing left

Fall

Now the dark begins to rise
Save your breath
It's far from over
Leave the lost and dead behind
Now's your chance to run for cover
I don't want to change the world
I just want to leave it colder
Light the fuse and burn it up
Take the path that leads to nowhere

All is lost again
But I'm not giving in

I will not bow
I will not break
I will shut the world away
I will not fall
I will not fade
I will take your breath away
Fall

Watch the end through dying eyes
Now the dark is taking over
Show me where forever dies
Take the fall
And run to heaven

All is lost again
But I'm not giving in

I will not bow
I will not break
I will shut the world away
I will not fall
I will not fade
I will take your breath away
And I'll survive
Paranoid
I have lost the will to change
And I am not proud
Coldblooded fake
I will shut the world away
Open your eyes!

Crowded streets all cleared away, one by one
Hollow heroes separate, as they run
You're so cold, keep your hand in mine
Wise men wonder while strong men die

Show me how it ends, it's all right
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well, that's all right
Let's give this another try

If you find your family, don't you cry
In this land of make-believe, dead and dry
You're so cold, but you feel alive
Lay your hands on me, one last time

Satisfied and empty inside

I try to face the fight within
But it's over
I'm ready for the riot to begin
And surrender
I walked the path that led me to the end
Remember
I'm caught beneath with nothing left to give
Forever

When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever
Forever

Gray skies will chase the light away
No longer
I fought the fight, now only dark remains
Forever
Divided, I will stand
And I will let this end

When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever
Forever
The sun begins to rise
And wash away the sky
The turning of the tide
Don't leave it all behind
I will never say goodbye

When angels fall with broken wings
I can't give up, I can't give in
When all is lost and daylight ends
I'll carry you and we will live forever

Take this love

I will make you
I will starve the pain within
I will crave you
I will learn to hate again
I will drain you
I will make you whole again
I will blame you
I will lay beside the dead

‘Cause I don’t want to live inside this hell

Tame the fire from within

Love will tie the tourniquet
And suffocate me

I won’t save you
I won’t starve the hope within
I won’t change you
I won’t fight the pain within
I won’t fail you
I won’t let your light descend
I won’t play you
I won’t face your fate again
