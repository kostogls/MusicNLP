Please come now I think I'm falling
I'm holding on to all I think is safe
It seems I found the road to nowhere
And I'm trying to escape
I yelled back when I heard thunder
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say
Let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down

I'm looking down now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace
I cried out, "Heaven save me"
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say
Let me say
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down
I'm so far down

Sad eyes follow me
But I still believe there's
Something left for me
So please come stay with me
'Cause I still believe there's
Something left for you and me
For you and me
For you and me

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down

Please come now I think I'm falling
I'm holding on to all I think is safe12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

That he can take this life and hold it by the hand
And he can greet the world with arms wide open

Hello my friend, we meet again
It's been a while, where should we begin?
Feels like forever
Within my heart are memories
Of perfect love that you gave to me
Oh I remember

When you are with me, I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice

We've seen our share of ups and downs
Oh, how quickly life can turn around
In an instant
It feels so good to reunite
Within yourself and within your mind
Let's find peace there

'Cause when you are with me, I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice
I just want to say hello again
I just want to say hello again

'Cause when you are with me, I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
'Cause when you are with me, I'm free

When dreaming I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"

Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"

Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets

So let's go there
Let's go there
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"


Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine

Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets
Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Court is in session
A verdict is in
No appeal on the docket today
Just my own sin
The walls are cold and pale
The cage made of steel
Screams fill the room
Alone I drop and kneel

Silence now the sound
My breath the only motion around
Demons cluttering around
My face showing no emotion
Shackled by my sentence
Expecting no return
Here there is no penance
My skin begins to burn

And I said ohhhhhhh
(So I held my head up high)
(Hiding hate that burns inside)
(Which only fuels their selfish pride)
And I said ohhhhhhh
(All held captive, out from the sun)
(A sun that shines on only some)
(We the meek are all in one)
I hear a thunder in the distance
See a vision of a cross
I feel the pain that was given
On that sad day of loss
A lion roars in the darkness
Only he holds the key
A light to free me from my burden
And grant me life eternally

Should have been there
On a Sunday morning
Banging my head
No time for mourning
Ain't got no time
Should have been there
On a Sunday morning
Banging my head
No time for mourning
Ain't got no time

And I said ohhhhhhh
(So I held my head up high)
(Hiding hate that burns inside)
(Which only fuels their selfish pride)
And I said ohhhhhhh
(All held captive, out from the sun)
(A sun that shines on only some)
(We the meek are all in one)
I cry out to God
Seeking only His decision
Gabriel stands and confirms
I've created my own prison
I cry out to God
Seeking only His decision
Gabriel stands and confirms
I've created my own prison

And I said ohhhhhhh

Affirmative may be justified
Take from one, give to another
The goal is to be unified
Take my hand, be my brother
The payment silenced the masses
Sanctified by oppression
Unity took a back seat
Sliding further into regression

One, oh, one, the only way is one
One, oh, one, the only way is one

I feel angry, I feel helpless
Want to change the world, yeah
I feel violent, I feel alone
Don't try and change my mind, no

Society, blind by color
Why hold down one to raise another?
Discrimination, now on both sides
Seeds of hate blossom further
The world is headed for mutiny
When all we want is unity
We may rise and fall
But in the end, we'll meet our fate again, oh
One, oh, one, the only way is one

I can't find the rhyme in all my reason
Lost sense of time and all seasons
Feel I've been beaten down
By the words of men who have no grounds
Can't sleep beneath the trees of wisdom
When your ax has cut the roots that feed them
Forked tongues in bitter mouths
Can drive a man to bleed from inside out

What if you did?
What if you lied?
What if I avenge?
What if eye for an eye?

I've seen the wicked fruit of your vine
Destroy the man who lacks a strong mind
Human pride sings a vengeful song
Inspired by the times you've been walked on
My stage is shared by many millions
Who lift their hands up high because they feel this
We are one, we are strong
The more you hold us down, the more we press on

I know I can't hold my hate inside my mind
Because what consumes your thoughts controls your life
So I'll just ask a question, a lonely, simple question
I'll just ask one question

What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?

What if you did?

What if eye for an eye?
What if your words
Could be judged like a crime?

Hurray for a child that makes it through
If there's any way because the answer lies in you
They're laid to rest before they've known just what to do
Their souls are lost because
They could never find

What's this life for? What's this life for?
What's this life for? What's this life for?

I see your soul, it's kind of gray
You see my heart, you look away
You see my wrist, I know your pain
I know your purpose on your plane
Don't say a last prayer because
You could never find

I see your soul, it's kind of gray
You see my heart, you look away
You see my wrist, I know your pain
I know your purpose on your plane
Don't say a last prayer because
But they aren't here anymore
Don't have to settle the score
Because we all live under the reign
Of one king

But they aren't here anymore
Don't have to settle no goddamn score
Because we all live under the reign
Of just as you know of one king, one king, one king

But they aren't here anymore
Don't have to settle no goddamn score

Of just as you know of one king, one king, one king

Peace is what they tell me
Love am I unholy
Lies are what they tell me
Despise you that control me

The peace is dead in my soul
I have blamed the reasons for
My intentions poor
Yes I'm the one who
The only one who
Would carry on this far

Torn, I'm filthy
Born in my own misery
Stole all that you gave me
Control you claim you save me

The peace is dead in my soul

At times life is wicked
And I just can't see the light
A silver lining sometimes isn't enough
To make some wrongs seem right

Whatever life brings
I've been through everything
And now I'm on my knees again

But I know, I must go on
Although I hurt, I must be strong
Because inside, I know
That many feel this way

Children, don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly away, away

At times life's unfair
And you know it's plain to see
Hey, God, I know I'm just a dot in this world
Have You forgot about me?
Whatever life brings
I've been through everything
And now I'm on my knees again

But I know, I must go on
Although I hurt, I must be strong
Because inside, I know
That many feel this way

Children, don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly away, away

Am I hiding in the shadows?
Forget the pain and forget the sorrows

I lie awake on a long dark night
I can't seem to tame my mind
Slings and arrows are killing me inside
Maybe I can't accept the life that's mine
No, maybe I can't accept the life that's mine
Simple living is my desperate cry
Been trading love with indifference
And, yeah, it suits me just fine
I try to hold on but I'm calloused to the bone
Maybe that's why I feel alone, yeah
Maybe that's why I feel so alone

Because me, I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holding together
I'm covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal
I am rusted and weathered
Barely holding together

And it just won't heal
No, it just won't heal, no, no, no

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust

The night hides your truth
The earth is a voice
Speaking to you
Take all this pride
And leave it behind
Because one day it ends
One day we die
Believe what you will
That is your right
But I choose to win
I choose to fight, to fight

Walking around I hear the sounds of the earth seeking relief
I'm trying to find a reason to live
But the mindless clutter my path
Oh, these thorns in my side

But I think they shoot because they want

Those who hide behind the shadows
Live with all that's dead

Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
At least look at me when you shoot
A bullet through my head
Through my head, through my head

Jealousy and lies
I laugh aloud because my life
Has gotten inside someone else's mind
Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
At least look at me when you shoot
A bullet through my head
Through my head, through my head

Hey, all I want is what's real
Something I touch and can feel
I'll hold it close and never let it go
Said why, why do we live this life
With all this hate inside?
I'll give it away
Because I don't want it no more
Please help me find a place
Somewhere far away

It's safe to say that I'm stuck again
Trapped between this life and the light
I just can't figure out, how to make it right

A thousand times before

So let it rain down and wash everything away

With every tomorrow comes another life

Loved by some, feared by others
She's immortalized in young men's eyes
Lust she breeds in the eyes of brothers
Violent sons make bitter mothers

Knowing I'll be underneath them
When they crumble when they fall
With clarity my scars remind me
Ash still simmers just under my skin

Difference smiles again
So much I hide
How is stepping back a move forward?

Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell mewhich is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you

Eerily time made no change
Pointing fingers, laying blame
Lying over and over and over and over
Deceiving your mind
Dug my grave, trash my name
Yet here I stand so you won't fade away

I spent a day by the river
It was quiet and the wind stood still
I spent some time with nature
To remind me of all that's real
It's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone
And remember that you feel
I said it's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone
And remember that you feel

Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man
Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man

Now I saw a face on the water
It looked humble but willing to fight
I saw the will of a warrior
His yoke is easy and his burden is light
He looked me right in the eyes
Direct and concise to remind me
To always do what's right
He looked me right in the eyes
Direct and concise to remind me
To always do what's right
Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man
Again I stand, Lord God I stand
Against the Faceless Man

Because if the face inside can't see the light
I know I'll have to walk alone
And if I walk alone to the other side
I know I might not make it home

Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man
Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man

Next time I see this face
I'll say I choose to live for always
So won't you come inside
And never go away
Next time I see this face
I'll say I choose to live for always
So won't you come inside
And never go away
Again I stand, Lord I stand

The rage in my eyes
Could have compared to the eye of a sun
Then rain
Took it's course through the hands of the Son
Repent for all time
The world is at war leaving all fault behind

So is this the end for us my friend?

The stains in the sky
Are there to remind us of man and his fight
When two worlds collide
One steals the life like a thief in the night
So look to the sky
He hold the keys for your life and mine


Well as though we rise
As the day breaks the dawn
And as the moon hides the sun
Oh, the sun
No more sorrow
All those crying days are gone
No more sorrow
Now it's gone
