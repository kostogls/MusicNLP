How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core, where I've become so numb
Without a soul, my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without, you can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real, bring me to life

Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become
Bring me to life, I've been livin' a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life
Frozen inside, without your touch, without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead

All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life

Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life, I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life114EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts
My once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away
All the sanity in me
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
Ah, me, ah, me, ah80EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Playground school bell rings again
Rain clouds come to play again
Has no one told you she's not breathing?
Hello, I'm your mind giving you someone to talk to
Hello

If I smile and don't believe
Soon I know I'll wake from this dream
Don't try to fix me, I'm not broken
Hello, I'm the lie living for you so you can hide
Don't cry

Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping
Hello, I'm still here
All that's left of yesterday29EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Lithium
Don't wanna lock me up inside
Lithium
Don't wanna forget how it feels without
Lithium
I wanna stay in love with my sorrow

Oh
But God, I wanna let it go
Come to bed, don't make me sleep alone
Couldn't hide the emptiness, you let it show
Never wanted it to be so cold
Just didn't drink enough to say you love me

I can't hold on to me
Wonder what's wrong with me

Lithium
Don't wanna lock me up inside
Lithium
Don't wanna forget how it feels without
Lithium
I wanna stay in love with my sorrow
Don't wanna let it lay me down this time
Drown my will to fly
Here in the darkness I know myself
Can't break free until I let it go
Let me go
Darling, I forgive you after all
Anything is better than to be alone
And in the end I guess I had to fall
Always find my place among the ashes

I can't hold on to me
Wonder what's wrong with me

Don't wanna lock me up inside

Don't wanna forget how it feels without

Stay in love with you
I, I'm gonna let it go29EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Now I will tell you what I've done for you
Fifty thousand tears I've cried
Screaming, deceiving and bleeding for you
And you still won't hear me (Going under)

Don't want your hand this time, I'll save myself
Maybe I'll wake up for once (Wake up for once)
Not tormented, daily defeated by you
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom

I'm dying again

I'm going under (Going under)
Drowning in you (Drowning in you)
I'm falling forever (Falling forever)
I've got to break through
I'm going under

Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
(So I don't know what's real)
So I don't know what's real and what's not
(Don't know what's real and what's not)
Always confusing the thoughts in my head (Oh)
So I can't trust myself anymore
I'm dying again

I'm going under (Going under)
Drowning in you (Drowning in you)
I'm falling forever (Falling forever)
I've got to break through
I'm

So go on and scream
Scream at me, I'm so far away (So far away)
I won't be broken again (Again)
I've got to breathe, I can't keep going under


I'm dying again

I'm going under (Going under)
Drowning in you (Drowning in you)
I'm falling forever (Falling forever)

Perfect by nature
Icons of self-indulgence
Just what we all need
More lies about a world that

Never was and never will be
Have you no shame, don't you see me?
You know you've got everybody fooled

Look here she comes now
Bow down and stare in wonder
Oh, how we love you
No flaws when you're pretending
But now I know she

Never was and never will be
You don't know how you betrayed me
And somehow you've got everybody fooled

Without the mask, where will you hide?
Can't find yourself
Lost in your lie
I know the truth now
I know who you are
And I don't love you anymore
It never was and never will be
You don't know how you betrayed me
And somehow you've got everybody fooled
It never was and never will be
You're not real and you can't save me
And somehow now you're everybody's fool17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I don't know your heart
I don't know where to begin
But I could feel you erasing the rivers I'd drawn in
The more I stood still
The faster you were running
You don't know how it feels crawling under your skin
So far, so far away
Don't you know we could be

High or Low
You never fell beneath me
And I gave up on you
But I never forgot you

I can't be your friend
Hold your hand while you bleed
There's nothing left to give you
Nothing more I need
Time to let it sleep
Oh, the damage was real
But nothing cut me so deep I could not heal
Don't you know we could be
High or Low
You never fell beneath me
And I gave up on you
But I never forgot you

I don't need drugs
I'm already six feet low
Wasted on you
Waitin' for a miracle
I can't move on
Feels like we're frozen in time
I'm wasted on you
Just pass me the bitter truth

Love, don't you remember?
We were the ones
Nothing could ever change and
Love, it's easier not to believe
We have broken everything
But here we are

Numb my head
'Til I can't think anymore
But I still feel the pain

I don't need drugs
I'm already six feet low
Wasted on you
Waitin' for a miracle
I can't move on
Feels like we're frozen in time
I'm wasted on you
Just pass me the bitter truth
Once, this was a garden
This was a world
All of the nightmares stayed in the dark
A little too much time by yourself
And you become the enemy
Just look at us now

Drowning slowly
Just to stay true

I don't need drugs
I'm already six feet low
Wasted on you
Waitin' for a miracle
And I can't move on
I feel like we're frozen in time
I'm wasted on you
Just pass me the bitter truth

Will I ever be the same? (Will I ever be the same?)
Am I strong enough to change? (Am I strong enough to change?)
Is it in my blood?
Shield my eyes to face the day (Shield my eyes to face the day)
Come too far to slip away (Come too far to slip away)
But it's killing me to go on without you
I don't need drugs
I'm already six feet low
I'm wasted on you (Wasted on)
Waitin' for a miracle
I can't move on
Like we're frozen in time
I'm wasted on you (Wasted on you)

Don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind

Should I let you fall, lose it all?
So maybe you can remember yourself
Can't keep believing
We're only deceiving ourselves
And I'm sick of the lie
And you're too late

Don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind

Couldn't take the blame, sick with shame
Must be exhausting to lose your own game
Selfishly hated, no wonder you're jaded
You can't play the victim this time
And you're too late
So don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind

You never call me when you're sober
You only want it 'cause it's over, it's over
How could I have burned paradise?
How could I - you were never mine

So don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
Don't lie to me
Just get your things
I've made up your mind14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I tried to kill my pain
But only brought more (So much more)

And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal
I'm dying, praying, bleeding and screaming
Am I too lost to be saved?

My God, my tourniquet
Return to me salvation

Do you remember me?
Lost for so long
Will you be on the other side
Or will you forget me?

Cover my ears and close my eyes
Just long enough to stop the noise
Go on, take everything and throw it away
But I will use my voice

Woah, woah, oh

Label me "bitch" because I dare to draw my own line
Burn every bridge and build a wall in my way

The more you try to fight it
The more you try to hide it
The more infected, rejected, you feel alone inside it
You know you can't deny it
The world's a little more fucked up every day

I'm gonna save you from it
Together we'll outrun it
Just don't give into the fear
So many things I would've told you If I knew that I was never gonna see you again

I wanna lift you up into the light that you deserve
I wanna take your pain into myself so you won't hurt

Don't you dare surrender
Don't leave me here without you
'Cause I could never
Replace your perfect imperfection

The way you look us over
Your counterfeit composure
Pushing again and again and sinking lower and lower
The world is on our shoulders
Do you really know the weight of the words you say?
You want a little of it
You just can't let go of it
You've got an ego to feed
Too late to rise above it
Don't look now but the little girl's got a grenade

I'm gonna lift you up into the light that you deserve
I'm gonna take you down to the real world so you can watch it burn

Don't you dare surrender
Don't leave me here without you
'Cause I could never
Replace your perfect imperfection

We stand undefined
Can't be drawn with a straight line
This will not be our ending
We are alive, we are alive

Don't leave me here without you

Replace your perfect imperfection
Don't you dare surrender

Catch me as I fall
Say you're here and it's all over now
Speaking to the atmosphere
No one's here and I fall into myself
This truth drives me
Into madness
I know I can stop the pain
If I will it all away
If I will it all away

Don't turn away
(Don't give in to the pain)
Don't try to hide
(Though they're screaming your name)
Don't close your eyes
(God knows what lies behind them)
Don't turn out the light
(Never sleep, never die)

I'm frightened by what I see
But somehow I know
That there's much more to come
Immobilized by my fear
And soon to be
Blinded by tears
I can stop the pain
If I will it all away
If I will it all away
Don't turn away
(Don't give in to the pain)
Don't try to hide
(Though they're screaming your name)
Don't close your eyes
(God knows what lies behind them)
Don't turn out the light
(Never sleep, never die)

Fallen angels at my feet
Whispered voices at my ear
Death before my eyes
Lying next to me I fear
She beckons me
Shall I give in
Upon my end shall I begin
Forsaking all I've fallen for
I rise to meet the end

Don't turn away
(Don't give in to the pain)
Don't try to hide
(Though they're screaming your name)
Don't close your eyes

Don't turn out the light

Still can't find what keeps me here
When all this time I've been so hollow inside
I know you're still there

I won't let you pull me down

Hunting you, I can smell you alive
Your heart pounding in my head

Ah... paper flowers
Ah... paper flowers

I linger in the doorway
Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name
Let me stay where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops, as they’re falling, tell a story

In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me

Don’t say I’m out of touch
With this rampant chaos - your reality
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
The nightmare I built my own world to escape

In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me
Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming
Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights
Oh, how I long for the deep sleep dreaming
The goddess of Imaginary light

In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me
