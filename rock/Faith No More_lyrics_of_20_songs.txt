Can you feel it, see it, hear it today?
If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway
You will never understand it, 'cause it happens too fast
And it feels so good, it's like walking on glass
It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright
It's so groovy, it's outta sight
You can touch it, smell it, taste it, so sweet
But it makes no difference 'cause it knocks you off your feet
You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

It's cryin', bleedin', lyin' on the floor
So you lay down on it and you do it some more
You've got to share it, so you dare it
Then you bare it and you tear it

You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's in your face, but you can't grab it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin
It's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win
It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain
It's sad, it happened, and it's a shame
You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's in your face, but you can't grab it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
What is it? It's it
What is it? It's it
What is it? It's it
What is it? It's it


You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's in your face, but you can't grab it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

If you want to open the hole
Just put your head down and go
And step beside the piece of the circumstance
You got to wash away the taste of evidence

Wash it away
Evidence, evidence, evidence
Got to taste evidence

I didn't feel a thing
It didn't mean a thing
Look in the eye and testify
Didn't feel a thing

Anything you say and we know you're guilty
Hands above your head and you won't even feel me
You won't feel me

Wash it away

Got to taste evidence

Force fed more than we'd eat in the wild
Grazed on a mash that could suffocate a child
Bloated, promoted in an ode to pomp and style
Moistening in the feed while we choke upon the bile
Cornering the market on the geese without the bones
Hushing out the public in a strike without a drone
The cage became collapsable
Our sticks equipped with stones

Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone

Hello, motherfucker
My lover
You saw it coming

Set aside the scruples in a stratagem of strain
A smallpox-laden blanket, invisible with stains
Inoculating bastards, bloody pecked pain
Distemper has a hold, distemper has a hold
We took the second sip from a cup we made of bones
The first it was a ruse, a trick, so aptly thrown
The truth is that our youth was a carpet laid in stones
Get the mother fucker on the phone, the phone

Hello, motherfucker

Goodbye, motherfucker

I'd like to peel the skin off
This winter day
I'd like to burn the hair off
This summer fling
What love can do when love's lost
Grow overweight
And smile as if
There's nothing left to say
Wear the cone of shame
Town is quiet now
Like it's holding its breath
Stone marks the spot
You know who you are
They outlined it in chalk
Word to the wise
And the barman calls time
I'd like to peel your skin off
So I can see what you really think
Or if there is anything
Under that cone of shame
I'd like to strip the bone off
So I can see how you're really made
And see how you really take
Your special pleasure
I'd like to pull your wings off
Read your lines like a gypsy
Just as lonely as anything
So infinite
Cone of shame covering all
You're only happy when you're pissing me off
Cone of shame covering all
I'm only happy when I'm pissing you off4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm coming Lord, I'm on my way
Worshiping at the altar of no one
Can't remember which God is my wine
Can't repent if I'm wrong; impartial
Empty rituals, trinkets and fossils
And now lord, I'm on my way (my way)
Amen

Peace ain't coming our way
But the sun keeps burning my face
Where's my faith?
My blasphemy
Keep singin', lord, I'm on my way
...Home

Floorboards and the ceilings are creaking
And the roof is old and leaking
But looking up high to the heavens
How can we declare our independence
From evolution and penance
(our way)
Sin ain't coming our way
But the sun keeps burning my face
When's my faith renewing today?
I believe in something, I think
Where's my faith

We were so happy
Things worked out better than we had planned
Capital from boy, woman and man
We're like ink and paper
Numbers on a calculator
Knew arithmetic so well
Working overtime
Completed what was assigned
We had to multiply ourselves
A bouncing little baby
A shiny copper penny
And he spent himself
Would not listen to us
But when he lost his appetite
He lost his weight in friends
He became a fat nickel so fast
Then came puberty
Exponentially
Soon our boy became a million
People loved him so
And helped him to grow
Everyone knew the thing that was best
Of course, he must invest
A penny won't do, no
A penny won't do, no
A penny won't do, no
A penny won't do, no
But he made us proud
He made us rich
But how were we to know
He's counterfeit

I know the feeling
It is the real thing
The essence of the truth
The perfect moment
That golden moment
I know you feel it too
I know the feeling
It is the real thing
You can't refuse the embrace

It's like the pattern below the skin
You gotta reach out and pull it all in
And you feel like you're too close
But you swallow another dose
The pinnacle of happiness
Filling up your soul
You don't think you can take any more
You never wanna let go
To touch the roots of experience
The most basic ingredients
To see the unseen glitter of life
And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife
Cherish the certainty of now
It kills you a bit at a time
Cradle the inspiration
It will leave you writhing on the floor
This is so unreal, what I feel
This nourishment, life is bent
Into a shape I can hold
A twist of fate, all my own
Just grit your teeth, make no sound
Take a step away and look around
Just clench your fist and close your eyes
Look deep inside, hypnotize
The whisper is but a shout
That's what it is all about
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away

Like the sacred song that someone sings through you, through you
Like the flesh so warm that the thorn sticks into, into
Like the dream you know one day will come to life, life
Try to hold on just a little longer, longer, stronger, stronger

It's the jewel of victory
The chasm of misery
And once you have bitten the core
You will always know the flavor
The split second of divinity
You drink up the sky
All of heaven is in your arms
You know the reason why
It's right there, all by itself
And what you are, there is nothing else
You're growing a life within a life
The lips of wonder kiss you inside
And when it's over the feeling remains
It all comes down to this
The smoke clears, I see what it is
That made me feel this way
I know the feeling
It is the real thing
The essence of the truth
The perfect moment
That golden moment
I know you feel it too
I know the feeling
It is the real thing
You can't refuse the embrace

This is so unreal, what I feel
Flood, sell your soul, feel the blood
Pump through your veins, can't explain
The element that's everything
Just clench your fist and close your eyes
Look deep inside, hypnotize
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away
You will never let it slip away
You will never let it slip away

Like the echoes of your childhood laughter, ever after
Like the first time love urged you to take it's guidance, in silence
Like your heartbeat when you realize you're dying, but you're trying
Like the way you cry for a happy ending, ending
Ending, ending
Ending, ending

Back and forth, I sway with the wind
Resolution slips away again
Right through my fingers, back into my heart
Where it's out of reach and it's in the dark
Sometimes I think I'm blind
Or I may be just paralyzed
Because the plot thickens every day
And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumbling away
But I know, there's a picture beneath
Indecision clouds my vision
No one listens...

Because I'm somewhere in between
My love and my agony
You see, I'm somewhere in between
My life is falling to pieces
Somebody put me together

Layin' face down on the ground
My fingers in my ears to block the sound
My eyes shut tight to avoid the sight
Anticipating the end, losing the will to fight
Droplets of "yes" and "no"
In an ocean of "maybe"
From the bottom, it looks like a steep incline
From the top, another downhill slope of mine
But I know, the equilibrium's there
Indecision clouds my vision
No one listens
Because I'm somewhere in between
My love and my agony
You see, I'm somewhere in between
My life is falling to pieces

Besides listening to my belly gurgle

I hate you
Talkin' to myself
Everybody's staring at me

Someone taps me on the shoulder every 5 minutes
No one speaks English anymore
Would anybody tell me if I was getting stupider?

I hate you
Talkin' to myself
You don't feel it after awhile
You take the beating
I'm a swingin' guy
Throw a belt over the shower curtain rod
And swing---
Toss me inside a hefty

I ain't about to guzzle no tears
So kiss my ass
Newscasters, cockroaches, and desserts

Maybe getting pregnant or on drugs or on welfare
On top of the world on the honor roll on parole
On the dodgers on the backs of milk cartons
On stakes in the middle of cornfields
On covers of future history books on old lady's mantles
Walkin' on water nailed on crosses

When lonesome stood over me
A future shadow
He boasted and sang to me
Farewell, so long

I’ll awake you
From this living sleep
We’ll walk the shore
Where you were born
In bed with me

Pull the white sheet off your face
March forward, my son
A battle beyond frozen years
Only for dogs here

We will rise from the killing floor
Like a matador

The stained glass of bovine eyes
Can see right through every tombstone lie
Let us retrace every step
Out of this world
And every ditch
Every ditch

We will be when you will be no more
No more

The stained glass up the hangman’s ass
We served you well, now we’re coming back

Atop the weight
Of conscious ghosts
We’ll jump the gates
And live to rise, we will rise


Let the dead live
May the dead live
And the dead live
What more can we give?
Let the dead live
May the dead live
And the dead live
The dead live…5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
