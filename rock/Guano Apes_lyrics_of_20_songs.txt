Hide your face forever
Dream and search forever
Have you ever been for sale
When your isms get smart
Oh so selfish and mindless
With that comment in your eye
Do you think that you are hard
Really harder than the other
Man you're acting cold
If you are not in charge
Don't split your mentality
Without thinking twice
Your voice has got no reason
Now is the time to face your lies
Open your eyes, open your mind
Proud like a God don't pretend to be blind
Trapped in yourself, break out instead
Beat the machine that works in your head
Will you offer me some tricks
If I ever need them
Would you go into that room
If I call 'em
Do you think that you are better
Really better than the rest
Realize there's a problem
I know that you can give your best
Have you ever had a dream
Or is life just a trip
A trip without chances
A chance to grow up quick
Open your eyes, open your mind
Proud like a god don't pretend to be blind
Trapped in yourself, break out instead
Beat the machine that works in your head
Hide your face forever
Dream and search forever
Night and night you feel nothing
There's no way outside of my land
Open your eyes, open your mind
Proud like a god don't pretend to be blind
Trapped in yourself, break out instead
Beat the machine that works in your headEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I've got the snowboard under my feet
I can fly so high, I can fall so deep
But who do I see comin' up the track
A little green man with the snowboard on his back
He said: And now I'm flying like an angel to the sun
My feet are burnin' and I grab into another world
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards, go mad like a clown
I can stay behind him if I can
I wanna be a little more than an "also-ran"
Through every curve he's got me beat
And maybe it's time that I accept defeat
And now I'm flying like an angel to the sun
My feet are burning and I grab into another world
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards, go mad like a clown
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards, go mad like a clown
The lords of the boards
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards, go mad like a clown
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards you'll come and get around
With the lord of the boards, go mad like a clown
With the lords of the boardsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Winter's city side
Crystal bits of snowflakes fall around my head and in the wind
I had no illusions
That I'd ever find the glympse of summer heatwaves in your eyes
You did what you did to me
Now it's history I see
Here's my comeback on the road again
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight
It's easy when you're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
It's when
You're Big in Japan
Then I'll sleep by your side all through the night
Big in Japan
It's easy to be...
Neon on my skin
Passing silhouettes of strange illuminated mannequins
Shall I stay here at the zoo?
Should I go and change my point of view for other ugly scenes
You did what you did to me
Now it's history I see
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight
It's easy when you're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
It's when
You're Big in Japan
Then I'll sleep by your side all through the night
Big in Japan
It's easy to be...
I feel you'll see they way
Too late, too late...
You're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
It's when
You're Big in Japan
Then I'll sleep by your side all through the night
Big in Japan
It's easy to be...
You're Big in Japan
Yeah and I'll sleep by your side all through the night
Big in Japan
It's easy to be...
You're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
It's when
Big in Japan...1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Someone is coming out to see the light of our destination
A maniac neurotic fool who wants to jump off the isle
How can you know that I'm the one
Who lives the maddest vacation
Another road another trial
Where's the difference
Tell me right
You can't stop me
To love the world with all its lies
(keep it to myself, keep it to myself)
You can't stop me
I'm close enough to kiss the sky
(keep it to myself, keep it to myself)
Why are you coming out to see the road of last destination
I won't look back for the shadows
They're growing up to me
We're trapped in this song
So we leave them to head our salvation
Another you, another me
Where's the difference
Tell it to me
You can't stop me
To love the world with all its lies
(keep it to myself, keep it to myself)
You can't stop me
I'm close enough to kiss the sky
(keep it to myself, keep it to myself)
Roadcracker
Bonebreaker
Street taker
You can't stop me
I love the world with all its lies
(keep it to myself, keep it to myself)
You can't stop me
I'm close enough to kiss the sky
(keep it to myself, keep it to myself)
I'm just another broken up
Mess them up
Running to the cosmic waysEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hey you there
How are you doing?
Can I ask you something?
Are you dead or alive?
I see you running through the night
And like always you eat and you are watching TV
You don't look that good or is something wrong with me?
I cannot wait until you operate
Now you hide in the bad and you are not coming out
Why is it so hard now?
Do you want me to get loud?
Do you want me to wash it out for you tonight?
When you are drifting slowly away
I'll be here to keep you the day
With fire in my eyes
I'll be like fire in your eyes
When you hide yourself from the light
I'll be here to burn you inside
With fire in my eyes
I'll be like fire in your eyes
When I just keep on falling up with all my love
Somebody put me on the hot track
Just one way to go
A fire injection
You've got it let me go
So I can move it slow
When you are drifting slowly away
I'll be here to keep you the day
With fire in my eyes
I'll be like fire in your eyes
When you hide yourself from the light
I'll be here to burn you inside
With fire in my eyes
I'll be like fire in your eyes
When I just keep on falling up with all my love
I wanna see
I wanna see
I wanna see the fire in your eyes
I wanna see
I wanna see
I wanna see the fire in your eyes
Can you give me
Can you give me
Can you give me the fire in your eyes?
Can you give me
Can you give me
Can you give me the fire in your eyes?
Come on, come on, come on, come on
I really need to see Sun shines on you
I really need to feel the fire burns in you
'Cause you're here to live in a light
You just learn to dance in the night
With fire in your eyes, with the fire in your eyes
If you're drifting slowly away
I'll be here to keep you the day
With fire in my eyes
With the fire in your eyes
I will keep on falling up with all your loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Hello, my name is Suzie
And I dream for a better, better glory
God bless you and I bless you
I'm angry why don't you squeeze me
The stage is my home and I guess when I roam
Things could get out of my head
God bless you and I leave you
When the weather is hot
SUCKER, yeah !
Hello, my name is Suzie
Don't spit on that floor like a loony
I'll bite you, so don't bite me
I'm angry why don't you squeeze me
The pain is my home and I guess when I roam
Things blow away my thoughts
God bless you and I catch you
When the weather is hot
SUCKER, yeah !
Hello, it's still Suzie
Ready to play what you like
Ready to say what you don't say
Immidiately to do sports
Suffering a new holocaust
Don't hit me, you will miss me
When the weather is hot
SUCKER, yeah !
Slide and winged all the memories
Sing with me this little irony
You won't escape from the reality
Let us do such a sport activity
My time's too short
I missed the mark and
I can't remember whyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm alone
Can't wait until I feel your rain
So unreal
Can't find another place of your rain
I believe
I still believe in your warm rain
I'm alone
Can't sleep until I feel your rain
How can I find
Love, Faith and Trust inside of your rain
So unreal, can't find another place of your rain
I believe
I still believe in your warm rain
So untrue
Help me to find through your warm rain
I send out my wishes
You gave me promises
Why don't you feel the same
(I'm sad, I feel like a little child
Somebody left, there is no rain)
Oh no, I'm waiting
How about your rain?
I can't believe
I still believe in your rain
Like in heaven
I can't wait until I feel your rain
So where's your life
Who's living the rest of your life
I can't, I can't
I can't live this life, I can't live this life
I can't see in your eyes
Can't change it, no more tries
Leave everyone with a smile
And you're sad, you feel like a little child
Somebody's left there is no rain
I send out my wishes ...3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Dont give me names
Youve got it all, took it all from me
Drove me insane
Whod come down to earth, releasing me
Healing my wounds
So why dont you close the door when youre leaving me
Now you'll run
Running all the way back to me again
Im not to end in shame
To fight an endless lie
Im not to play a game
I won't be on your side
(i) found a way
To reach myself again but all i saw was shame
Drive me away
Theres something deep in me waiting to escape
You think you know me
So why dont you close the door when youre here with me
Im here to end the game
Im living in a lie
Its hard to give the same
I won't be on your side
Im not to end in shame
To fight an endless lie
Im not to play a game
I won't be on your side
I loved you a lot
To need you a lot
I leave you aloneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Pretty in scarlet
So pretty in scarlet

We slept a while
To turn it off
And get it off our minds
I slept a while
To get it all
It seems alright
To find a place without a single lie
Where is the night
We ran into

Cuz' nothing is good, I can't explain
Falling down and caught up the rain
I turn myself into changes
The night I kissed you goodbye
Cuz' nothing is good, I can't explain
Falling down and caught up the rain
I turn myself into changes
Your death is over

You want to live a lie
I'm pretty in scarlet
Come on
You want to wash it down
I'm pretty in scarlet
I turn myself to say goodbye
You want to live a lie
I'm pretty in scarlet
Come on
You want to wash it down
I'm pretty in scarlet
I turn myself to say
It's o.k
It doesn't count
Found my place
A deeper sound
Let me dive alone
Let me dive alone

You gave me wine
To poison me
And take away my time
I can hear you cry
I wonder why

Cuz' nothing is good, I can't explain
Falling down and caught up the rain
I turn myself into changes
The night I kissed you goodbye
Cuz' nothing is good, I can't explain
Falling down and caught up the rain
I turn myself into changes
Your death is over

You want to live a lie
I'm pretty in scarlet
Come on
You want to wash it down
I'm pretty in scarlet
I turn myself to say goodbye
You want to live a lie
I'm pretty in scarlet
Come on
You want to wash it down
I'm pretty in scarlet
I turn myself to say goodbye
Pretty in scarlet
Pretty in scarlet
Pretty in scarlet

You want to live a lie
I'm pretty in scarlet
Come on
You want to wash it down
I'm pretty in scarlet
I turn myself to say goodbye
You want to live a lie
I'm pretty in scarlet
Come on
You want to wash it down
I'm pretty in scarlet
I turn myself to say goodbye

And if you throw a stone on me (I'm pretty in scarlet)
And if you need some pain to see
And if you live your lies (I'm pretty in scarlet)
I will run, I will run, I will run, I will run away
And if you throw a stone on me (I'm pretty in scarlet)
And if you need some pain to see
And if you live your lies (I'm pretty in scarlet)
I will runEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Quietly
Explodes your love
Your insecurity
Is so soft to me
I can't let you breathe in
We are falling into us
I see you dying in my eyes

Just let it all go
You are left, and so am I
(we go insane)
Just let it all go
You're left, so am I
We leave all inside

Quietly
We arrive
My insecurity
Is so soft to you
You can't let me breathe in
We are falling in too deep
I'm dying in your open mouth
Just let it all go
You're left, so am I
(We go insane)
Just let it all go
You're left, so am I
You leave all, you leave all inside
Let it all go
You're left, so am I

Let it all go
You're left, so am I
We leave all inside

So you can't leave them all
So can't leave them all inside
And we can't go all, it's right
It's a fact we can't deny
If you have to go
Please go quiet
Please go quietly

Just let it all go
You're left, so am I
(We go insane)
Just let it all go
You're left, so am I
We leave all, we leave all inside
Let it all go
You're left, so am I

Just let it all go
You're left, so am I
You leave all, you leave all inside

Loaded forecast on you
The pants are tight
You are ready to use
Searching for some trouble
Who's gonna be the one
And try to feed your hunger
Empty eyes
Leading your own sorrow
No one to get on
No one to roll over this night honey
The lavatory is open
As you blocked his head away
Twenty-one is such a good number
Conversation lost its weight anyway
We are walking on a thin line
No you better stay away from this
And shut your mouth
And read my lips
We are just kids
Do you talk to me
Pull the string
So I can be a doll
You won't cover me up
Cause I'm the girl who kisses the dawn
Kiss the dawn
Kiss the dawn
Rebel mad and broken
Why do you throw your days away
Twenty-one was not a good number
Conversation lost its hate anyway
You are walking on a thin line
And you better avoid the risk
So shut your mouth
And read my lips
We are just kids
Do you talk to me
Pull the string
So I can be your doll
You won't cover me up
Cause I'm the girl who kisses the dawn
Don't you talk to me
Pull the string
Don't want to be your doll
You can't cover me up
Because I'm the girl who eats the scrubEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You can get it
Come and climb under my skin
Overtake it
Pushing me on a fast lane
Come let's get away
No one knows you like I do
We will pass it
Let the tyres kiss the ground

You should go ahead
(So fast)
You should go ahead
(So fast)
You should go ahead
(So fast)

Break the line
We have to go
'Cause there's no way back
Where we coming from
Break the line
We have to go
'Cause there's no way back
Where we coming from
I'm your engine
Got you strapped into my seat
Here's our tactic
We get faster the more I scream
Come let's get away
No one drives you like I do
I'm collapsing
Let the tyres kiss the ground

You should go ahead
(So fast)
You should go ahead
(So fast)
You should go ahead
(So fast)

Break the line
We have to go
'Cause there's no way back
Where we coming from
Break the line
We have to go
'Cause there's no way back
Where we coming from
Break the line
And all I try
Is to break the thin line
Nothing's gonna
Stop the way of life
Be sure that it's safe
I'll show you a place
Where we can be and everyone is dreaming of...
(Ah...)

You should go ahead
(So fast)
You should go ahead
(So fast)

Break the line
We have to go
'Cause there's no way back
Where we coming from
Break the line

O.K
Ready to take off
Do it slow
I'm living on the bottom
I got to go
Five little fingers
Grabbing at the glass
Gone, those days
Now I'm running
Up and down in my cage
Too late to defend, I'm buried - insane
Don't you know there's more to life than to win
Are you that kind of stereotype?
There's no time, there's no time
There's nothing I could answer
No Speech
As long (as) I get nothing
No Speech
As long (as) I get nothing
But I've got to get home
So let me free, this is not my home
Put away your
Flashing stick
Don't try to get closer-
Through my head
Give me a little
Bit more of your own
A little more, don't wanna be
Anybody's clown
Too late to defend, I'm buried - insane
Don't you know there's more to life than to win
Are you that kind of stereotype ?
There's no time, there's no time
There's nothing I could answer
No Speech
As long (as) I get nothing
No Speech
As long (as) I get nothing
But I got to get home
Let me free, this is not my home
No Speech

We were glowing like a flame
Undercover night and day
You took me up so high
It felt like a paradise
Breathing you in, breathing you out
We felt like shooting stars
But we went up too far
No way to go but down
It was so beautiful
Before the fall
I'm flying too close to the sun
It was so beautiful
Before the fall
I'm flying too close to the sun
I was all yours
I felt the earth turn
Shooting so high
We had to get burned
It was so beautiful
Before the fall
I'm flying too close
I'm flying too close to the sun
Oh I miss you missing me
And all the things we never be
You took me up so high
It felt like a paradise
Breathing you in, breathing you out
We felt like shooting stars
But we went up too far
No way to go but down
It was so beautiful
Before the fall
I'm flying too close to the sun
It was so beautiful
Before the fall
I'm flying too close to the sun
I was all yours
I felt the earth turn
Shooting so high
We had to get burned
It was so beautiful
Before the fall
I'm flying too close
I'm flying too close to the sun
You've written in my heart
I'll always remember you
Remember me
Together but apart
I'll always remember you
You've set me free
I was all yours
I felt the earth turn
Shooting so high
We had to get burned
It was so beautiful

Love is like a shelter
Brings me through the storm
Life is full of anger
Maybe I'm dead again now
Maybe there's life in me
So much stronger than the world gives it to me
Here's the deal, leave it or not
What a surprise, your baby's unborn
Nothing else is deeper
Nothing else is good
Noone cares about the blood in you
I see you through that all
I feel you through the wall
Save my child and I save...
I in me and you are here now
Hold it, save it, never let me down again
I don't feel the darkness
Don't feel anything
Pressure's lost and pressure's good with you
Don't move and don't hide secrets
Play hard, play alone
Move the soul without your own control
Nothing else is deeper...
I in me and you are here now...
What'cha sayin'...
Watch again....
Why you're here...
Noone cares...
I in me and you are here now...1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Could you step away, I'm a vicious girl
Could you fill the break?
We're on the right way, to swing the little axe
It's the right day, to give up the tax
We use the pain, for our fantasy
We need some pain to find the right way
We love the pain and want some more of it
Control the pain, chickenhead !
Right way turning, listen we are learning
Head full of noise
Chickens got no choice
Heads are rollin
Chickenblood is stolen
The rest of the chicken
Wants to picke-nicken
Could you feed your chicken, cause I'm hungering
Drinks and chips for free
The muscles like Bruce Lee
We use the pain for our fantasy
We need some pain to find the right way
We love the pain and want some more of it
Control the pain, chickenhead !
Right way turning listen we are learning ...
Painfull, the table's red
Big storm and no regret
Dark side, we use the pain
Captain, we are lost insane
Mother, we cut the dump, mother
Mother, we all, we all, we all
Right way turning, listen we are learning ...1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

The sand, the sand, covers the land
It's just a victim
You didn't stop it
High noon and the walk brings the storm with it
Born to it or lay on it
Day on day, night on night
With the thrill of a kid on my side
I will survive
As long as this trip will go
With my soul
I search for water
You need the cold
I need some bubbles and a crown of gold
Crossing the deadline before it's too late
The finger snaps to the center... of anger, wait

Cross the line you will suffer
(no bridge, just one step)
Cross the line you will suffer
(no bridge, no way back)
Cross the line you will suffer
(better give up, better stand up)
Cross the line you will suffer
(better give up, better shut up)
So where's the mountain?
I can't reach the top of this world
(One, two, three, four)
The man, the man, covers the land
