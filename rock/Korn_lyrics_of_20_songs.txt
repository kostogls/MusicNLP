Something takes a part of me
Something lost and never seen
Every time I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me, from me
Life's gotta always be messin' with me (You wanna see the light)
Can't they chill and let me be free? (So do I)
Can't I take away all this pain? (You wanna see the light)
I try to every night, all in vain, in vain

Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

Feelin' like a freak on a leash (You wanna see the light)
Feeling like I have no release (So do I)
How many times have I felt diseased? (You wanna see the light)
Nothing in my life is free, is free
Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

Mother, please forgive me
I just had to get out all my pain and suffering
Now that I am done remember I will always love you
I'm your son

Little child, looking so pretty
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy
Innocent child, looking so sweet
I'll rape your mind and now your flesh I reap

You raped, I feel dirty!
It hurt, as a child!
Tied down, "that's a good boy"!
And fuck, your own child!
I scream, no one hears me!
It hurt, I'm not a liar!
My God, saw you watch!
Mommy, why your own child?

It hurt, as a child!
Tied down, no one hears me!
Mommy why your own child?
I didn't touch you there!
Mommy said she didn't care!
I didn't touch you there!
That's why mommy stopped and stared!

Little child, looking so sweet

Hey, I'm feeling tired
My time has gone today
You flirt with suicide
Sometimes that's okay
Do what others say
I'm here standing hollow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

Day is here fading
That's when I'm insane
I flirt with suicide
Sometimes kill the pain
I can't always say
"It's gonna be better tomorrow"
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

Beating me down!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Screaming some sound!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Falling away from me
It's spinning round and round
Falling away from me
It's lost and can't be found
Falling away from me
It's spinning round and round
Falling away from me
Throw it down

Beating me down!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Screaming some sound!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!

Twisting me!
They won't go away!
So I pray!
Go away!
Life's falling away from me
It's falling away from me
Life's falling away from me
Fuck!
Beating me down!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Screaming some sound!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down

Are you ready?

This place inside my mind
A place I like to hide
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind
Another place I find
To escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind
Deeper, and deeper, and deeper
As I journey to live a life that seems to be
A lost reality
That can never find a way to reach my inner...
Self-esteem is low
How deep can I go
In the ground that I lay
If I don't find a way to
See through the gray that clouds my mind
This time I look to see what's between the lines
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind

I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind (I can see I'm going)
I can see, I can see I'm going blind (going blind)
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind!
I'm blind!
I'm blind!
I'm blind!

I wouldn't be angry if you'd just fucking cry
Your tears would arouse me, refreshing my supply
The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky
Repulsion invades me, I say goodbye

Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in vain

I wouldn't be angry if things would stay the same
You're fighting the torment that helps me feed my pain
The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky
Repulsion invades me, I say goodbye

Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in…

I can't hear this (scat singing)
I can't fuck it (scat singing)
I can't take this (scat singing)
I hate (scat singing)
Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away

Hate, something, sometime, someway
Something kick off the front floor
Mine, something inside I'll never ever follow
So give me something that is for real, I'll never ever follow
Get your boogie on
Get your boogie on
Hate, something, someway, each day
Dealing with no forgiveness
Why, this shit inside, now everyone will follow
So give me nothing just feel and now this shit will follow

God paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say
God paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say

Each day I can feel it swallow
Inside something they took from me
I don't feel your deathly ways
Each day I feel so hollow
Inside I was beating me
You will never see so come dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Me!
God paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say

'Cause right now I'm all it, kid
Suck my dick, kid, like your daddy did
Who the fuck you think you're talking to? (Me)
I'm known for eating little whiny chumps like you (Whatever)
All up in my face with that "are you ready?"
But halitosis is all you're rocking steady
You little fairy, smelling on your flowers
Nappy hairy chest, look, it's Austin Powers (Aw, yeah, baby)
I hear ya tweetin' on them fag-pipes, clod
But you said it best, there's no place to hide

What the fuck ya saying? You're a pimp, whatever, Limp dick
Fred Durst needs to rehearse, needs to reverse what he's saying
Wanna be Funkdoobiest when you're playing
Ripping up a bad counterfeit, faking
Plus your bills, I'm paying

Lay off the bacon

Climbing shoots and ladders, while your ego shatters

You're more like Jerry Springer (Oh, cool)
Your favorite band is Winger (Winger?)
And all you eat is Zingers
You're like a Fruity Pebble
Your favorite flag is rebel (Yeehaw)
It's just too bad that you're a fag and on a lower level

So you're from Jacksonville, kicking it like Buffalo Bill
Getting butt-fucked by your uncle Chuck
While your sister's on her knees (Oh yeah?)
Waiting for your little peanut

Wait, where'd you get that little dance? (Over here)
Like them idiots in Waco, you're burning up in Bako
Where your father had your mother
Your mother had your brother (Nuh-uh)
It's just too bad your father's mad, your mother's now your lover

Come on, hillbilly

You love it down south and, boy

Keep holding on
When my brain's ticking like a bomb
Guess the black thoughts
Have come again to get me
Sweet bitter words
Unlike nothing I have heard
Sing along, mockingbird
You don't affect me
That's right!
Deliverance of my heart!
Please strike!
Be deliberate!

Wait, I'm coming undone!
Irate, I'm coming undone!
Too late, I'm coming undone!
What looks so strong, so delicate!
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate!
And soon I anticipate!
I'm coming undone!
What looks so strong, so delicate!

Choke, choke again
I thought my demons were my friends
Pity me in the end
They're out to get me
Since I was young
I tasted sorrow on my tongue
And the sweet sugar gun
Does not protect me
That's right!
Trigger between my eyes!
Please strike!
Make it quick now!
Wait, I'm coming undone!
Irate, I'm coming undone!
Too late, I'm coming undone!
What looks so strong, so delicate!
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate!
And soon I anticipate!
I'm coming undone!
What looks so strong, so delicate!

I'm trying to hold it together
Head is lighter than a feather
Looks like I'm not getting better
Not getting better

Wait, I'm coming undone!
Irate, I'm coming undone!
Too late, I'm coming undone!
What looks so strong so, delicate!
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate!

This time, I'm taking it away
I've got a problem
With me getting in the way
Not by design
So I take my face
And bash it into a mirror
I won't have to see the pain
Pain, pain!

This state is elevating
As the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again!

The hurt inside is fading (aah-aah-aah)
This shit's gone way too far
All this time, I've been waiting
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore
For what's inside awaking (aah-aah-aah)
I'm not, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and (aah-aah-aah)
Oh, I cannot give any more

My mind's done with this, okay?
I've got a question
Can I throw it all away?
Take back what's mine
So I take my time
Guiding the blade down the line
Each cut closer to the vein
Vein, vein
This state is elevating
As the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again!

The hurt inside is fading (aah-aah-aah)
This shit's gone way too far
All this time, I've been waiting
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore
For what's inside awaking (aah-aah-aah)

This state is elevating
As the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again!

The hurt inside is fading (aah-aah-aah)
This shit's gone way too far
All this time, I've been waiting
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore
For what's inside awaking (aah-aah-aah)
I'm not, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and (aah-aah-aah)
Oh, I cannot give any more

(Aah-aah-aah)
Give any more! (aah-aah-aah)
Give any more! (aah-aah-aah)
Give any more! (aah-aah-aah)
Give any more!9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Life

Things keep ending up this way
Another notch is carved away
In the thoughts of mass decay
Funny how things end up this way

Beaten down
Dominated by its sound
Growing deep within my head
Softly dying, its soul is shed
Eating me all up inside
This cancer finds everything I hide
Living my life horrified
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life

Life
That's not right out insane

Satisfaction is delayed
Its motivation is displayed
Flaunting its misogyny
Funny how I thought it'd go away
Beaten down
Dominated by its sound
Growing deep within my head
Softly dying, its soul is shed
Eating me all up inside
This cancer finds everything I hide
Living my life horrified
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life

Life
That's not right out insane

I'm constantly beat up inside
And I'm the one to blame
No one can relate to me
That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane
Beaten down
Dominated by its sound
Living my life horrified
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life

Beaten down
Dominated by its sound
Growing deep within my head
Softly dying, its soul is shed
Eating me all up inside
This cancer finds everything I hide

Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life

Life is degrading and silently making me
Spun out inside my own head
Spewing and craving, this darkness is baiting me
Down the road to my own death

I can't take this, I might break it
Watch it all fall down

So come give me the truth you hide
Take the pain inside

Humiliating, I fall to its craving
It feeds on the doubt in my heart
Sinking and fading, our feelings I'm saving
To fix what I tore all apart

I can't take this, I might break it
Watch it all fall down

So come give me the truth you hide
Take the pain inside
I'm lost, you'll never find me
I'm lost, you'll never find me
I'm lost, you'll never find me
I'm lost, you'll never find me
I'm lost, you'll never find me
I'm lost, you'll never find me
I'm lost, you'll never find me
I'm lost

So come give me the truth you hide
Take the pain inside

I'm lost, ah, you'll never find me
I'm lost, you'll never find me, ah
(I watched you die, now watch me die)
I'm lost, you'll never find me, ah
I'm lost
Come for me

I'm not doing fine
I'm not doing fine
I'm not doing fine
I'm not doing fine
I'm not doing fine
I'm not doing fine
I'm not doing fine
I'm not doing fine

Ring around the Rosies
Pocket full of posies
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down
Ring around the Rosies
Pocket full of posies
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down

Nursery rhymes are said
Verses in my head
Into my childhood, they're spoon-fed
Hidden violence revealed
Darkness that seems real
Look at the pages that cause all this evil

One, two, buckle my shoe
Three, four, shut the door
Five, six, pick up sticks
Seven, eight, lay them straight
London Bridge's falling down
Falling down
Falling down
London Bridge is falling down my fair lady

Verses in my head
Into my childhood, they're spoon-fed
Hidden violence revealed
Darkness that seems real

There you are alone
With no hope of ever having
Something to be proud of
Something earned without begging
Yes, I know you're a person
A person close to me
Who do you think you are, and what more do you want from me?

Ball tongue!
Ball tongue!
Ball tongue!
Ball tongue!

Why are you at home
Buried in your self-pity?
Why do you insist on living the life clean out of me?
Yes, I know you're the person
The person that took time with me
Does it give you the right to expect your life revolves around me?
Ball tongue!
Ball tongue!
Ball tongue!

How can you fucking doubt me? But not again (there you are alone)
How can you fucking doubt me? But not again (with no hope of ever having)
How can you fucking doubt me? But not again (something to be proud of)
How can you fucking doubt me? But not again (something earned without begging)
How can you fucking doubt me? But not again (yes, I know you're a person)

I dream of a past so I can break through
The walls I have built inside
The thoughts I can grasp, transparency through
They constantly fight and collide

I'd love to see a different world
A place where you can't find me

Feel me, kill me, my back's up against the wall
Your magic spell doesn't work anymore
Kill me, kill me, that's what you've got to face my friend (My friend!)
This ain't the end (End!)

Why can't I relax and let it be true?
This world that I tried to hide
It's kind of a mess, too reckless for you
This place makes me feel alive

I'd love to see a different world
A place where you can't find me
Feel me, kill me, my back's up against the wall
Your magic spell doesn't work anymore
Kill me, kill me, that's what you've got to face my friend (My friend!)
This ain't the end (End!)

The call for the purposes, the changing behavior
Ends at us all, we keep constraints on the strangers
It gets on top of you and forces your perspective
Then you know it, you feel it
It's as dark as you can get you want it
Harder, harder, harder, give it to you
Harder, harder, you might just want it
Harder, harder, harder, give it to you
Harder, harder, I don't think you'll ever get it

Feel me, kill me, my back's up against the wall
Your magic spell doesn't work anymore
Kill me, kill me, that's what you've got to face my friend (My friend!)
This ain't the end (End!)4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
