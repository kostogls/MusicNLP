No change, I can change

I can't change my mould
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Well I've never prayed, but tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now

No change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould

I can't change it you know, I can't change it
'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony, that's life
Trying to make ends meet
Trying to find somebody, then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places

All this talk of getting old
It's getting me down, my love
Like a cat in a bag
Waiting to drown
This time I'm coming down

And I hope you're thinking of me

They just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again

Now the drugs don't work

Cause I passed down my old street

Then just let me know
And I'll sing in your ear again
Now the drugs don't work
They just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again

'Cause, Baby, ooh, if heaven calls
I'm coming too
Just like you said
You leave my life
I'm better off dead

Something in my liberty
Oh, my, my

Coming and going

How many times do I have to learn
All the love I have is in my mind?

Well, I'm a lucky man
With fire in my hands

My friend and me
Looking through her red box of memories
Faded I'm sure
But love seems to stick in her veins you know

Yes, there's love if you want it
Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord
Yes, there's love if you want it
Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord
My lord

Why can't you see
That nature has its way of warning me
Eyes open wide
Looking at the heavens with a tear in my eye

Yes, there's love if you want it
Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord
Yes, there's love if you want it
Don't sound like no sonnet, my lord
My lord
Sinking faster than a boat without a hull
My lord
Dreaming about the day when I can see you there
My side
By my side

Here we go again and my head is gone, my lord
I stop to say hello
Cause I think you should know, by now

I wander lonely streets
Behind where the old Thames does flow
And in every face I meet
Reminds me of what I have run from

In every man, in every hand
In every kiss, you understand
That living is for other men
I hope you do understand

I've got to tell you my tale
Of how I loved and how I failed
I hope you understand
These feelings should not be in the man
In every child, in every eye
In every sky, above my head
I hope that I know
So come with me in bed
Because it's you and me, we're history
There ain't nothing left to say
When I will get you alone
Maybe we could find a room
Where we could see what we should do
Maybe you know it's true
Living with me is like keeping a fool

In every man, in every hand
In every kiss, you understand
That living is for other men
I hope you know that I am me so come on

I'm thinking about history
And I'm living for history
And I think you know about me
Cause I am
And one and one is two
But three is company
When you're thinking about the things you do
And you're thinking about the things you do
I want to tell you my tale
How I fell in love and jumped out on my bail
Do you understand?
There's more in a smile than in a hand
In every sky, in every kiss
There's one thing that you might have missed
And why am I going to
A place that now belongs to you?
But you were mean and so am I
Let's pick it up, let's even try
To live today, so why not smile
Don't dream away your life, cause it is mine
It is mine
Is that a crime?
Is that a crime?
This life is mine
But the bed ain't made, it's filled full of hope
I've got a skin full of dope
Oh the bed ain't made, but it's filled through of hope
I've got a skin full of dope1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Will those feet in modern times
Walk on soles that are made in China?
Through the bright prosaic malls
And the corridors that go on and on and on
Are we blind - can we see?
We are one, incomplete
Are we blind - in the shade?
Waiting for lightning to be saved, yeah

Cause love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm singing again
Love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm singing again, again...

Will those feet in modern times
Understand this world's affliction?
Recognize the righteous anger?
Understand this world's addiction?
I was blind - couldn't see
What was here in me
I was blind - insecure
Felt like the road was way too long, yeah

When morning breaks
We hide our eyes and our lung's aching
Nothing's strange
It was in our hands from 6 to 10
It slipped right out again

There'll be no better time
There'll be no better way
There'll be no better day to save me
Save me

There is no time for cracking up

And yes
I still feel strong

Into the half light
Another velvet morning for me, yeah

Time
Stands still
As you take
Your last pill


And now I'm trying to tell you
About my life
And my tongue is twisted
And more dead than alive
And my feelings
They've always been betrayed
And I was born a little damaged man
And look what they made
I said, don't you find
That it's lonely
The corridor, you walk there alone

And life is a game
You've tried
And life is a game
You're tired

I talked to god in a phone box on my way home
I told you my answer
I left you my dreams on your answer machine

Come on
Let the spirit inside you
Don't wait to be found
Come along with my sound
Let the spirit move you
Let the waves come up
They'll fuse you
I never met no one to deny a sound

I must be going insane
I called the doctor so he can relieve my pain
He's got a little pill for me
Just a little luxury
Help me through my day

Forget the lovers you've know

Don't take it slow

Something I'm not quite sure of
But just for today
Let go and slide away

Let the night sky cool your foolish pride
Don't you feel alive

So take your time
I wonder which cup you'll drink from
I hope it's mine
Because you always do that something
Something I'm not quite sure of
But just for today
Let go and slide away
'Cause I read your mind
I read it because it takes me where I can't find
Because you always do that something
Something I'm not quite sure of

Let go and burn away

This is a tale of a northern soul
Looking to find his way back home
He's coming from that same old road
You know the one your folks don't know
I want to see if you know me
I was born in a rented room
My mother didn't get no flowers
Dad didn't approve of me, do you?
I'm alive with something inside of me
And I don't think I'm coming back
So come on, come in inside of me
Let's spread it all around
Give me your powder and pills
I want to see if they cure my ills
I've no time for love and devotion
No time for old fashioned potion
I wanna see if you know me
Take a look into my eyes
I tell you so many lies and then I'll
I'll let you go into the night
I'm alive with something inside of me
And I don't think I'm coming down
I'm alive with something inside of me

I stand accused just like you
For being born without a silver spoon
Stood at the top of a hill
Over my town I was found

I've been on the shelf too long
Sitting at home in my bed too long
Got my things and now I'm gone
How's the world gonna take me?

Finding myself used to be hard
But now I see the light
If love is a drug
Then I don't need it


We've got a lot of living to do
There's a door in my mind that's open wide
Come inside come inside
Jesus never saved me
He'll never save you too, and, you know
I've got a little sticker on the back of my boot
This is music
And now I see the light shining bright in my eyes
If love is the drug then it ain't for me
Well music is my life
And loved by me
I'm gonna move on the floor with my sweet young thing
Down down down we go till we reach the bottom
Of our soul with this is musicEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You won't find your fortune, you might find some pain

In a world full of confusion, yeah the human race

Is there anywhere better than here?
You know these feelings I found, they are oh so rare
Is there anywhere better than here?

Sometimes life seems to tear us apart
I don't wanna let you go
Sometimes these feelings hit me, I start to cry
Cause I won't ever let you go

Oh my my my my we're multiplying
Always living under some cloud
Always on the eve of destruction
Make you wanna scream out loud
And as I watched the birds soar
Mighty lies and wishes spun
Oh mama mama why I'm still crying
Oh now the day is come


But I'd rather be here than be anywhere

Seen it all I'm already there
Save your books and your pills
I don't need them I'm there
You can do anything you want to
All you've got to do is try
I thought the best days had left me
My best years had left me behind
Then I watched them come back (to me)

And all the wild eyes
All the wild eyes know what I mean

If trees cut stars and eyes to heaven
I'll bend them back I'll bend them again
If my skin looks tired and old from living
I'll turn right back and live it again
You better pray when the music stops
And you're left alone in your mind
I'll be hearing music till the day I die
Then I heard it turn off
I swear I heard the screams

They're scared they've lost their dream
They press down on me
You know I thought I was there

Hello, high, are you?
Yes?
Well that explains it
Oh you were walking round like some kind of angel
You were walking round like some kind of angel
