Well I heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
Well it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Well, baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

There's the moon asking to stay
Long enough for the clouds to fly me away
Well it's my time coming, I'm not afraid, afraid to die
My fading voice sings of love
But she cries to the clicking of time, oh, time

Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire

And she weeps on my arm
Walking to the bright lights in sorrow
Oh drink a bit of wine we both might go tomorrow, oh my love
And the rain is falling and I believe my time has come
It reminds me of the pain I might leave, leave behind

Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire

(It reminds me of the pain)
I might leave, leave behind
And I feel them drown my name
So easy to know and forget with this kiss
I'm not afraid to go but it goes so slow
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire, oh oh yea oh oh oh yeah unh
Wait, wait, wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Wait in the fire, wait ah uh unh ah23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Looking out the door I see the rain
Fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water
Maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind
So you never know

Broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight, child
You know how much I need it
Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run

Sometimes a man gets carried away
When he feels like he should be having his fun
And much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no-one
So I'll wait for you, and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return
Oh, will I ever learn?
Oh lover, you should've come over
Cause it's not too late

Lonely is the room, the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with him
My body turns and yearns
For a sleep that won't ever come
It's never over
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over
All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her
It's never over
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over
She's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
Well maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrong

Oh... Ohh... Ohhhhh... Ohhhhhh...
Ohh..... lover, you should've come over
Yes, yes, I feel too young to hold on
And I'm much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage I've done
Sweet lover, you should've come over
Oh, love well I'll wait for you
Lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover you should've come over
Cause it's not too late28EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

This is our last goodbye
I hate to feel the love between us die
But it's over, just hear this and then I'll go
You gave me more to live for, more than you'll ever know

Well, this is our last embrace
Must I dream and always see your face?
Why can't we overcome this wall?
Baby, maybe it's just because I didn't know you at all

Kiss me, please kiss me
Kiss me out of desire, baby, not consolation
Oh, you know it makes me so angry cause I know that in time
I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye, ohhh

Ooooh
Ooooh
Ooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Did you say, "No, this can't happen to me!"
Did you rush to the phone to call
Was there a voice unkind
In the back of your mind
Saying maybe
You didn't know him at all
You didn't know him at all, oh oh, ya didn't know
Ooohh, didn't know
Well, the bells out in the church tower chime
Burning clues into this heart of mine
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes
And the memories, offer signs that it's over
It's over17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I lost myself on a cool, damp night
I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
And be what I want to be
When I think more than I want to think
I do things I never should do
I drink much more than I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me nearly here

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?
Lilac wine, I feel unready for my love
Feel unready for my love7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'm lying in my bed, the blanket is warm
This body will never be safe from harm
Still feel your hair, black ribbons of coal
Touch my skin to keep me whole

Oh, if only you'd come back to me
If you laid at my side
Wouldn't need no Mojo Pin
To keep me satisfied

Don't wanna weep for you, don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
Memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
Black Beauty, I love you so

Oh, precious precious silver and gold
And pearls in oyster's flesh
Drop down we two to serve
And pray to love
Born again from the rhythm
Screaming down from heaven
Ageless, ageless
And I'm there in your arms
Don't wanna weep for you, I don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
Black Beauty, I love you so
So, so, so, so

Oh the welts of your scorn, my love, give me more
Send whips of opinion down my back, give me more
Well it's you I've waited my life to see
It's you I've searched so hard for

Don't wanna weep for you, don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
Black Beauty, I love you so
So, Black Black Black Beauty10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Love, let me sleep tonight on your couch
And remember the smell of the fabric of your simple city dress

Oh... that was so real
Oh... that was so real
Oh... that was so real

We walked around til the moon got full like a plate
And the wind blew an invocation and I fell asleep at the gate
And I never stepped on the cracks cause I know I'd lose my mother
And I couldn't awake from the nightmare that sucked me in and pulled me under
Pulled me under

Oh... that was so real
Oh... that was so real
Oh... that was so real


I love you, but I'm afraid to love you
I love you, but I'm afraid to love you
I'm afraid...

My eyes are a baptism
Oh, I am fuse
And sing her into my thoughts
Oh, phantom elusive thing

Oh, all flowers in time bend towards the sun

It's ok to be angry
But not to hurt me

While this town is busy sleeping
All the noise has died away
I walk the streets to stop my weeping
Cause she'll never change her ways

Don't fool yourself, she was heartache from the moment that you met her
Ah, my heart feels so still as I try to find the will to forget her, somehow
Oh, I think I've forgotten her now

Her love is a rose, pale and dying
Dropping her petals in land unknown
All full of wine, the world before her, was sober with no place to go

Don't fool yourself, she was heartache from the moment that you met her
My heart is frozen still as I try to find the will to forget her, somehow
She's somewhere out there now


Well my tears falling down as I try to forget
Her love was a joke from the day that we met
All of the words, all of her men
All of my pain when I think back to when
Remember her hair as it shone in the sun
The smell of the bed when I knew what she'd done
Tell yourself over and over you won't ever need
Her again
But don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
Oh, my heart is frozen still as I try to find the will to forget her, somehow
She's out there somewhere now

Oh She was heartache from the day that I first met her
My heart is frozen still as I try to find the will to forget you, somehow
Cause I know you're somewhere out there right now8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There is a child sleeping near his twin
The pictures go wild in a rush of wind
That dark angel he is shuffling in
Watching over them with his black feather wings unfurled

The love you lost with her skin so fair
Is free with the wind in her butterscotch hair
Her green eyes blew goodbyes
With her head in her hands
And your kiss on the lips of another
Dream, brother with your tears scattered round the world

Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name
Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
And nobody ever came


Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name
Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
And nobody ever came
Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name
Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
And nobody ever came
Nobody ever came
I feel afraid and I call your name
I love your voice and your dance insane
I hear your words and I know your pain
With your head in your hands and her kiss on the lips of another
Your eyes to the ground and the world spinning round forever
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Eternal life is now on my trail
Got my red glitter coffin, man, just need one last nail
While all these ugly gentlemen play out their foolish games
There's a flaming red horizon that screams our names

And as your fantasies are broken in two
Did you really think this bloody road
Would pave the way for you?
You better turn around
And blow your kiss hello to life eternal, angel

Racist everyman, what have you done?
Man, you've made a killer of your unborn son...
Crown my fear your king at the point of a gun
All I want to do is love everyone...

And as your fantasies are broken in two
Did you really think this bloody road
Would pave the way for you?
You better turn around
And blow your kiss hello to life eternal
There's no time for hatred, only questions
What is love, where is happiness
What is life, where is peace?
When will I find the strength to bring me release?

Tell me where is the love in what your prophet has said?
Man, it sounds to me just like a prison for the walking dead
And I've got a message for you and your twisted hell
You better turn around and blow your kiss goodbye to life eternal angel

He bear her off, he bear her down
He bear her into an orchard ground

Lu li lu lay lu li lu lay
The falcon hath bourne my mate away

And in that orchard there was a hold
That was hanged with purple and gold
And in that hold there was a bed
And it was hanged with gold so red

Lu li lu lay lu li lu lay
The falcon hath bourne my mate away

And on this bed there lyeth a knight
His wound is bleeding day and night
By his bedside kneeleth a maid
And she weepeth both night and day

Perhaps it is the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
But mama, you've been on my mind

I mean no trouble, please don't put me down, don't get upset
I am not pleading, or saying I can't forget you
I do not pace the floor, bowed down and bent, but yet
Well, mama you've been on my mind

Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts they might be narrow
Where you've been don't bother me, or bring me down in sorrow
I don't even mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow
But mama, you're just on my mind

I am not askin' you to say words like yes or no
Please understand me, I have no place, I'm calling you to go
I'm just whispering to myself so I can pretend that I don't know
Mama, you're just on my mind
Well, mama you're just on my mind

When you wake up in the morning, baby look inside your mirror
You know I won't be next to, you know I won't be near
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mindEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Twenty-nine pearls in your kiss, a singing smile
Coffee smell, and lilac skin, your flame in me
Twenty-nine pearls in your kiss, a singing smile
Coffee smell, and lilac skin, your flame in me
I'm only here for this moment
I know everybody here wants you
I know everybody here thinks they need you
I'll be waiting right here just to show you
How our love will blow it all away
Such a thing of wonder in this crowd
I'm a stranger in this town, you're free with me
And our eyes are locked in downcast love
I sit here proud
Even now you're undressed in your dreams with me
I'm only here for this moment
I know everybody here wants you
I know everybody here thinks he needs you
I'll be waiting right here just to show you
How our love will blow it all away
And all the tears we cried have dried on yesterday
A sea of fools have parted for us, there's nothing in our way, my love
Don't you see? Don't you see?
You're just the torch to put the flame to all our guilt and shame
And I'll rise like an ember in your name
No. No
I know everybody here wants you
I know everybody here thinks they need you
I'll be waiting right here just to show you
Oh let me show you that love can rise just like embers
Love can taste like the wine of the age, oh babe
And I know they all look so good from a distance
But I tell you I'm the one
I know everybody here well thinks he needs you, thinks he need you
And I'll be waiting right by here just to show you3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed, oh well, enough said
I know it's over still I cling, I don't know where else I can go
Over, over
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head

You see the sea wants to take me, the knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride please be happy
Handsome groom give her room
Loud loutish lover treat her kindly though she needs you
More than she loves you

I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over, over

I know it's over
It never really began but in my heart it was so real
And she even spoke to me and said
"If you're so funny, why are you on your own tonight?"
"And if you're so clever, why are you on your own tonight?"
"And if you're so very entertaining, why are you on your own tonight?"
"And if you're so very good looking, why do you sleep alone tonight?"
I know, because tonight is just like any other night
That's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms
While they are in each other's arms
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
Over, over, it's over, it's over
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes guts to be gentle and kind
Over, over
Love is natural and real
But not for you my love, not tonight my love
Love is natural and real
But not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head

Time takes care of the wound
So I can believe
You had so much to give
You thought I couldn't see
Gifts for boot heels to crush
Promises deceived
I had to send it away
To bring us back again

Your eyes and body brighten
Silent waters, deep
Your precious daughter in the
Other room, asleep
A kiss "goodnight" from every
Stranger that I meet
I had to send it away
To bring us back again

Morning theft
Unpretender left
Ungrateful

True self is what
Brought you here, to me
A place where we can
Accept this love
Friendship battered down by
Useless history
Unexamined failure
What am I still to you?
Some thief who stole from you?
Or some fool drama queen
Whose chances were few?
Love brings us to who we need
A place where we can save
A heart that beats as
Both siphon and reservoir
You're a woman, I'm a calf
You're a window, I'm a knife
We come together
Making chance in the starlight

Meet me tomorrow night
Or any day you want
I have no right to wonder
Just how, or when
You know the meaning fits
There's no relief in this
I miss my beautiful friend
I had to send it away
To bring her back againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

How many times have you heard someone say
If I had money, I would do things my way
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
Money can't buy back all your youth when you're old
A friend, when you're lonely, or peace to your soul
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind
When my life is over and my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones, I will leave, there's no doubt
But, one thing's for certain, when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind
One thing's for certain, when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

You and I
Ah, the calm below that poisoned river wild
You and I
Tears that dry on a rude awakened child
Where you look down
I've walked before, burning holes
With eyes of liquid brown
If we had only known, in a way
We wouldn't reach this ground
You were my only home, silver eyes
I want to see you shine
And we will feel the weight
Fall away from us in time
Searching our past for the true
You and I, you and I, you and I
All for you
Where you think you'll fall
I adore you
Where you shut your soul
I will open for you
If we had only known, in a way
We'd never reach this ground
I'll know, silver eyes
I can see us shine
I said, we will feel the weight
Fall away from us in time
Searching our past for a true

Beware the bottled thoughts of angry young men
Secret compartments hide all of the skeletons
Little girl wants to make her home with him
In the middle of the shore, she wonders
"Don't know what you asked for"
"Don't know what you asked for"
All young lovers know why
Nightmares blind their mind's eye
Your rube is young and handsome
So new to your bedroom floor
You know damn well where you'll go
I've loved so many times and I've drowned them all
From their coral graves, they rise up when darkness falls
With their bones they'll scratch the window
I hear them call
"Don't know what you asked for"
"Don't know what you asked for"
"Don't know what you asked for"
All young lovers know why
Nightmares blind their mind's eye
Your rube is young and handsome
So new to your bedroom floor
You know damn well where you'll go
Stay with me under these waves, tonight
Be free for once in your life, tonight
Your rube is young and handsome
So new to your bedroom floor
You know damn well where you'll go

Your rube is young and handsome
So new to your bedroom floor

Lady, all the troubles are my fright, I disgust you
Feel the power you cut the truth into you
Why do you think I did not on this rely?
I could kiss you with lines of escape in my mouth
Please let me bring back these gifts of mine to the woman
Stars shined on my back as I slept and knew you
You didn't leave it all
You made an even call
My belly released the stars and tears between the scars
Ooh
Below this we'll end here until the end of time
Beyond the moment that ends our bondage
I am your failed husband contender
I'm your loan shark of bliss
This dream you've ridden on turns your world to explosions
I need to be alone to heal this bleeding stone
Now, smell the rain of London, it still insists
That we beg for our purity
As if we are pure in the reign of our contentment
As if I can think of this no more1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
