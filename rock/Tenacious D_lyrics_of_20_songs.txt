This is the greatest and best song in the world...
...tribute

Long time ago, me and my brother Kyle here
We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon
In the middle of the road
And he said
"Play the best song in the world
Or I'll eat your soul" (Soul)

Well, me and Kyle
We looked at each other
And we each said
"Okay"
And we played the first thing that came to our heads
Just so happened to be
The best song in the world
It was the best song in the world

Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one make two
Two and one make three
It was destiny
Once every hundred-thousand years or so
When the sun doth shine
And the moon doth glow
And the grass doth grow
Needless to say
The beast was stunned
A whip-crack went his whippy tail
And the beast was done
He asked us *snort*
"Be you angels?"
And we said, "Nay
We are but men!" Rock
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah
Ohhh, whoah
Ah-whoah-oh

This is not the greatest song in the world, no
This is just a tribute
Couldn't remember the greatest song in the world, no
No, this is a tribute, oh
To the greatest song in the world, alright
It was the greatest song in the world, alright
Yeah, it was the best motherfuckin' song
The greatest song in the world

Ah-rah, dee
Soo-guh-goo-gee-goo-gee
Goo-guh fli-goo gee-goo
Guh fli-goo, ga-goo-buh-dee
Ooh, guh-goo-bee
Ooh-guh-guh-bee-guh-guh-bee
Fli-goo gee-goo
A-fliguh woo-wa mama Lucifer!
And the peculiar thing is this, my friends
The song we sang on that fateful night
It didn't actually sound anything like this song

This is just a tribute
You've got to believe me
And I wish you were there
Just a matter of opinion
Ah, fuck!
Good God, gotta love it
So surprised to find you can't stop it
A fiery ring of fire
Rich motherfucker, aw
Alright
Alright15EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I am complete!
Fu-uuck
Yes, you are fucked
Shit out of luck
Now I'm complete
And my cock you will suck
This world will be mine
And you're first in line
You brought me the pick
And now you shall both die
Wait, wait
Wait you motherfucker
We challenge you to a rock-off
Give us one chance to rock your socks off
Fuck, fuck
Fuuuuuuck
The demon code prevents me
From declining a rock-off challenge
What are your terms?
What's the catch?
If we win
You must take your sorry ass back to Hell
And also, you will have to pay our rent
And what if I win?
Then you can take Kage back to Hell...
(What?)
Trust me Kage, it's the only way
(What the fuck are you talking about?)
To be your little bitch
Fine
Let the rock-off begin
Aahahahahahaaa!
I'm the Devil
I love Metal
Check this riff
It's fucking tasty
I'm the Devil, I can do what I want
Whatever I've got I'm gonna flaunt
There's never been a rock-off
That I've ever lost
I can't wait to take Kage back to Hell
I'm gonna fill him with my hot demon gel
I'll make him squeal
Like my Scarlet Pimpernel
Noooooo!
Come on Kage, bring the thunder
There's just no way that we can win
That was a masterpiece
Listen to me
He rocks too hard
Because he's not a mortal man
Goddammit, Kage!
He gonna make you his sex slave
You're gonna gargle Mayonnaise
No...
Unless we bust a massive monster mamma-jam
Dude, we've been through so much shit
Deactivated lasers with my dick
Now it's time to blow this fucker down!
Come on, Kage
Now it's time to blow doors down
I hear you Jables
Now it's time to blow doors down
Light up the stage
'Cause it's time for a showdown
We'll bend you over
Then we'll take you to brown town
Now we've got to blow this fucker down
He's gonna rape me if we do not blow doors down
Come on Kage
'Cause it's time to blow doors down
Oooh, we'll piledrive ya
It's time for the smackdown
Hey Antichrister
Beelzeboss
We know your weakness
Our Rocket Sauce
We rock the Casbah
And blow your mind
We will defeat you
For all mankind
You hold the scepter
We hold the key
You are the Devil
We are the D!
We are the D
We are the D
We are the D

Come on Kage, you're coming with me
Taste my lightning fucker
NOOO!
Ow! Fuck

Oh no
From whence you came
You shall remain
Until you are complete again
Nooooooo!
Fuck you, Kage
And fuck you, Jables

A long-ass fucking time ago
In a town called Kickapoo
There lived a humble family
Religious through and through
But yea, there was a black sheep
And he knew just what to do
His name was young J.B
And he refused to step in line
A vision he did see
Of fucking rocking all the time
He wrote a tasty jam
And all the planets did align

Oh, the dragon's balls were blazing
As I stepped into his cave
Then I sliced his fucking cockles
With a long and shiny blade
'Twas I who fucked the dragon
Fuckali, sing fuckaloo
And if you try to fuck with me
Then I shall fuck you too

Got to get it on in the party zone
I gots to shoot a load in the party zone
Got to lick a toad in the party zone
Got to suck a chode in the party zone
You've disobeyed my orders, son
Why were you ever born
Your brother's ten times better than you
Jesus loves him more
This music that you play for us
Comes from the depths of Hell
Rock and Roll's the Devil's work
He wants you to rebel
You'll become a mindless puppet
Beelzebub will pull the strings
Your heart will lose direction
And chaos it will bring

You better shut your mouth
You better watch your tone
You're grounded for a week
With no telephone
Don't let me hear you cry
Don't let me hear you moan
You got to praise the Lord
When you're in my home

Dio, can you hear me?
I am lost and so alone
I'm asking for your guidance
Won't you come down from your throne?
I need the tight compadre
Who will teach me how to rock
My father thinks you're evil
But man, he can suck a cock
Rock is not the Devil's work
It's magical and rad
I'll never rock as long as I am
Stuck here with my Dad
I hear you, brave young Jables
You are hungry for the rock
But to learn the ancient method
Sacred doors you must unlock
Escape your father's clutches
And this oppressive neighborhood
On a journey you must go
To find the land of Hollywood

In the City of Fallen Angels
Where the ocean meets the sand
You will form a strong alliance
And the world's most awesome band
To find your fame and fortune
Through the Valley you must walk
You will face your inner demons
Now go, my son, and Rock

So he bailed from fucking Kickapoo
With hunger in his heart
And he journeyed far and wide
To find the secrets of his art
But in the end he knew
That he would find his counterpart
Rock
Rock

This is a song for the ladies
But fellas... listen closely

You don't always have to fuck her hard
In fact sometimes that's not right to do
Sometimes you've got to make some love
And fucking give her some smooches too
Sometimes you got to squeeze
Sometimes you got to say please
Sometime you got to say, hey

I'm gonna fuck you... softly
I'm gonna screw you gently
I'm gonna hump you sweetly
I'm gonna ball you discreetly

And then you say, hey I brought you flowers
And then you say, wait a minute Sally
I think I got something in my teeth
Could you get it out for me?
That's fucking teamwork
What's your favorite posish?
That's cool with me
It's not my favorite
But I'll do it for you
What's your favorite dish?
I'm not gonna cook it
But I'll order it from Zanzibar

And then I'm gonna love you completely
And then I'll fucking fuck you discreetly
And then I'll fucking bone you completely

But then I'm gonna fuck you hard!

You can't kill The Metal
The Metal will live on
Punk Rock tried to kill The Metal
But they failed, as they were smite to the ground
New Wave tried to kill The Metal
But they failed, as they were stricken down to the ground
Grunge tried to kill The Metal
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
They failed, as they were thrown to the ground

Ah, yeah
Ah, yeah

No one can destroy The Metal
The Metal will strike you down with a vicious blow
We are the vanquished foes of The Metal
We tried to win, for why? We do not know

New Wave tried to destroy The Metal
But The Metal had its way
Grunge then tried to dethrone The Metal
But Metal was in the way
Punk Rock tried to destroy The Metal
But Metal was much too strong
Techno tried to defile The Metal
But Techno was proven wrong

High above the mucky-muck
Castle made of clouds
There sits Wonderboy
Sitting oh so proudly
Not much to say
When you're high above the mucky-muck
Yeah, yeah

Wonderboy
What is the secret of your power
Wonderboy
Won't you take me far away
From the mucky-muck man

Now it's time for me to tell you about Young Nastyman
Arch-rival and nemesis of Wonderboy
With powers comparable to Wonderboy
What powers you ask?
I don't know how about the power of flight
That do anything for ya?
That's levitation, holmes
How about the power to kill a yak
From 200 yards away
With mind-bullets
That's telekinesis, Kyle
How about the power
To move you
History of Wonderboy
And Young Nastyman
Rigga-goo-goo
Riggah-goo-goo
A secret to be told
A gold chest to be bold
And blasting forth
With three-part harmony
Yeow!

Wonderboy
What is the secret of your power
Wonderboy
Won't you take me far away
From the mucky-muck man

Well Wonderboy and Young Nastyman joined forces
They formed a band the likes of which had never been seen
And they called themselves Tenacious D
That's right

Me
And KG
(That's me)
We're now Tenacious D
Come fly with me, fly

Wonderboy
What is the secret of your power
Wonderboy
Won't you take me far away
From the mucky-muck man

Oh
Take my hand
Young Nastyman
And we'll fly
Bring out your broadsword
There's the Hydra
Slice his throat
And grab his scrot'
You take the high road
I'll take the low
There, the crevasse, fill it
With your mighty juice5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When The Pick of Destiny was released
It was a bomb
And all the critics said
That the D was done
The sun had set
And the chapter had closed
But one thing no one thought about
Was the D would rise again

Just like the phoenix
We'll fucking rise again
That's right, the phoenix
We'll rise again! Ya

'Cause the fiery heart of a champion
Cannot be quelched
By a failure or an embarrassment
No way, no
And the critics all agreed
It was a stinky pile of cheese
But that does not mean
That our hearts are not strong
Just like the phoenix
We'll fucking rise again, yah
That's right, the phoenix
We'll rise again!

Sun shinin'
It's a hell of a day
Ridin' back
And it's headed your way
D's here
Now we're puttin' on a show
We're sneakin' up
Climbin' into your window

Hard rockin'
Yeah we're rockin' again
Black Mamba is my personal friend
Phil Jackson is the master of zen
We'll pick you up
Take you out for the weekend

It's the rise of the phoenix
It's a call of attack
And you'll know when you've seen us
The fuckin' D is back!
Love-makin'
All the way to the top
Boots smokin'
But I'm not gonna stop
Bossa Nova is a beautiful dance
Hot-blooded
That's a lots of romance

It's the rise of the phoenix
And we ride with the pack
It's the magic between us
The fuckin' D is back

But what if it's true?
If Tenacious D has died, what will we do?
And what will we do
'Bout all the fans who have the D tattoo?
They'll have them removed
They'll have to laser off their D tattoos
Tattoo-oos
They'll have to laser off their D tattoos
Ah
Wait a minute, Kage
(What's that you say?)
You know it's not too late
(Yes it is too late)
We only need one hit
(Just imagine it)
We could be the shit!
Too legit to quit
One hit, one hit, one hit
Yeah, we're hoping this is it
One hit
Top ten hit
Top forty hit
Top thousand hit
I don't care
As long as we get there
We'll start anew
And you can get a new Tenacious D tattoo

Upon your fucking sexy ass, and squeeze

Take off your blouse
And your underpants
Then take a look
'Cause here me and KG come naked
Out of the side hatch
With the oils and perfume and incense
Now you're grooving
Put on a cool '70s groove
A funky groove to fuck to
A funky groove to fuck to
Me, me and KG
It's all about sex supreme
We likes to cream jeans (Sex)
Have you ever been worked on
By two guys who are hot for your snatch (Sex)
That's what I'm offering you
You step into our room
And then you smell the perfume
You lay upon our roundish bed
And then you feel a tickling on your head
It's KG with the feather and the French tickler
Look out baby, he got the tools
And then you feel something down by your feet
It's me, it's JB
I'm sucking upon your toes

We don't mind sucking on toes
Good luck finding
A boyfriend who sucks toes, oh
Having sex with me and KG
Now you're talking double team

BLLLLP! OK. It starts off... a dark stage, and then a beam of light,and you can see me and my guitar
In the end of time
There was a man
Who knew the road
And the writing
Was written on the stone
And then a thin layer of fog comes in around my ankles. Roadies, that means dry ice. We're gonna talk about this later
In the ancient time
An artist led the way
But no one
Seemed to understand
Chimes, Freddy
In his heart he knew
The artist must be true
But the legend of the rent
Was way past due
And then, Katie, you come in with the bass
Well, you think you'll be just fine
Without me, but you're mine
You think you can
Kick me out of the band
And then, Zack, you come in with a face-melter. OK ?
Well, there's just one problem there
The band is mine
How can you kick me out
Of what is mine ?
And then... Hawaii Five-O. You ever see that show ? OK, well, there's a drum solo in it that goes:
You're not hardcore
Unless you live hardcore
And I want the backup singers to be like:
Well, you're not hardcore
(No, you're not hardcore)
Unless you live hardc...
(Unless you live hardcore)
But the legend of the rent
Was way hardcore
Boom ! Big old explosion. Some, like, confetti comes down. That's all I got so far. It's a work in progress

This is a song for the people in the streets
Not the people City Hall
All you motherfuckers in the streets
It's time to rise up
Come along children
And fucking rise

Lots of times when me and KG are watching
All the fucking shit that goes down at City Hall
We get the feeling we should fuck shit up
Yeah, we should fucking start a riot
A riot!

We have 'em screaming in the streets
We have tipping over shit
And breaking fucking windows of small businesses
And settin' fuckin' fires
And settin' fuckin' fires
And settin' fuckin' fires
And then after the smoke has cleared
And the rubble has been swept away
Me and KG will peek out our heads
We've been watching the riots on a monitor
Twenty floors below sea level
From a bunker
We did it Rage-Kage
We beat the bastards of City Hall
Maniacal laughter
But now what will we do?
We must rebuild
But who will lead us in the rebuilding process?
Man, it's got to be someone with the know-how
And the elbow grease
To lead us to a new land
No, not me and KG
We don't have the cognitive capacity to lead
Alright, we'll do it!

We'll lead as Two Kings
We'll lead as Two Kings
Ah-aaahh

Well it's 3pm, time to lug the gear
Gotta get it on the stage
My muscles flex, my fuckin' sweat will save the day
When I check the mic, I fuckin' check the mic
I fuckin' checka-checka one, two, three
I plug it in, I make it sound as good as can be
Cause the rockers rock, but the roadies roll
Gotta take mic because I take control
Gotta get that shit up on that fuckin' stage
Because the roadie knows what the roadie knows
And the roadie knows that he wears black clothes
And he hides off in the shadows of the stage
Because the roadie
Looks a thousand miles with his eyes
And when the crowd roars
Brings a tear drop to the roadie's eyes
Tears of pride
Because he brought you the show
But you will never know
He's changing the strings
While hiding in the wings
No matter how hard, the show must go on
Then a beautiful girl come to me
She say, "Hey can I sucka your dick?"
I say "Yes", I am in love
Then she quickly say "I sucked your dick
Now give me that backstage pass
I do not want you roadie, I want KG's chode"
I'm standing at the threshold of your dreams
Without me there'd be no sound from those amps
Without me there'd be no lights on the stage
But you don't applaud for me

No, I am the roadie!

This is a song called
The History of Tenacious D
And it's not just a list of bullshit
That we've done in the past
It's a chronicling of our rise — To power!

We ride with kings on mighty steeds
Across the Devil's plain
We've walked with Jesus and his cross
He did not die in vain — No!

We've run with wolves, we've climbed K2
Even stopped a moving train
We've traveled through space and time, my friends
To rock this house again — Rock!

We ride and we ride, and we'll never subside
And we'll ride 'til the planets collide
And if you say that we do not ride
I'll tan your fuckin' hide — Ride!

Kyle's fingers be silver — Jack's voice then be gold
But lest you think we're vain
We know you're all robots, and we don't care
Tenacious D — We reign!
We reign
Supreme
Oh God
Burrito Supreme
And a Chicken Supreme
And a Cutlass Supreme
Supreme, yeah

Senorita, tasty mamacita
Tell me baby, what's your name
Oh Conchita, won't you have a seat-a
Tell me baby, who's to blame?
I'll fuckin' kill the man who has done you wrong
My body's shakin' out of control
His name is Larry, oh he's really scary
Drinkin' at the fuckin' bar
Tap his shoulder, muscles like a boulder
Tell him that's he's gone too far
He laughs and tells me to fuckin' fuck myself
Now my blood is boilin' over my soul
Hey!

I'm sorry, I didn't hear that
Did you just tell me to fuckin' fuck myself?
Yeah
Well I'm telling you to step outside
Oh really?
Yeah, we got some things to talk about
A little lady named Conchita
Hey!
Yeah, you harmed her
What? Who said? Who are you?
Yeah, fuck you you piece of shit
*Fight*
When my fist connects and Larry falls down to the ground
I see he's cut me with a bottle
My pistol rises, cause it's time to double down
Larry runs, I chase him out full-throttle
Donde estas mi horse? Ayee
Digame, donde estas Larry? Ayee
En los montanes? Donde, en los canyon?
Muy bien, cold-water canyon?
Andole, hey, ha, ha
Ah, te llamo mi Conchita
Yo tengo hombre para tu gota
Mira mi cada
Soy en fuego para tu bueso
Mi amor
Watchin' Larry in his sanctuary thinkin' that he got away
With Conchita, oh my mamacita, kissing him upon the face
I fuckin' rue the day that I fought for you
Now my mind is spinnin' out of control
Ah I'm sorry mamacita
Oh my little senorita
I ? senorita7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Climb upon my big-assed steed

What's the name of the song, Explosivo!
Don't know what it's about, but it's good to go
What's the name of my girlfriend? I don't know
But she's built like the shit, and she's good to go, go
She's good to go, she's good to go

We are fueled by Satan
Yes, we're schooled by Satan
Fueled by Satan!
Writin' those tasty riffs
Just as fast as we can
Schooled by Satan!

We were the inventors
Of the cosmic astral code
We've come to blow you away
We've come to blow your nose
We've come to fuckin' blow
We've come to blow the show
We've come to fuckin' blow
You know it, you know it!
What's the name of the song, Explosivo!
Don't know what it's about but it's good to...

I am not one of you
I come from an ancient time
I am known as The Kicker of Elves
I am also known as The Angel Crusher

Well, me and Kage are hungry
We're hungry for some fruit
We wander through the garden
It would be a hoot
To eat some low hangin' fruit
We're on a freaky pursuit
Don't want no high class model in designer fuckin' bathing suit
We want the low hangin' fruit
Me and Kage are horny
We're lookin' for a snack
Lookin' for a plump one
With a tasty crack
We want some low hangin' fruit
She wear the pink parachute
She got the shit kickin' boots
We need the low hangin' fruit
She got the flip-flops on with hot red potatoes
And the butt-floss on with fried green tomatoes
And she love that song we sing for the ladies
Come on! Oh my god!
Let's start at a flip (random noises)
Low hangin' fruit
She wears a pink parachute
She got the fly tattoo and the honky-tonky daisy dukes
We love the low hangin' fruit
Because the high-class fruit is not gonna fuck me
But the low-class fruit is sweet chunky monkey
When you smoke that fruit, you smell like a skunky
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
