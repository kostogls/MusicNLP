We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything or anyone

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life
Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how, as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?102EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I'll sing it one last time for you
Then we really have to go
You've been the only thing that's right
In all I've done

And I can barely look at you
But every single time I do
I know we'll make it anywhere
Away from here

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear
Louder, louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak, I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

To think I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbye
I nearly do
Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear
Louder, louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak, I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

Slower, slower
We don't have time for that
All I want's to find an easy way
To get out of our little heads
Have heart, my dear
We're bound to be afraid
Even if it's just for a few days
Making up for all this mess


Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Woah woah, what if this is all the love you ever get?
Woah woah, you'd do a couple things so differently, I bet
Woah woah, what if this is all the love I ever know
Woah woah, I'd say the words that were so hard to say: don't go

So you've fallen in love
So you've fallen apart

What if it hurts like hell
Then it'll hurt like hell
Come on over, come on over here
I'm in the ruins too
I know the wreckage so well
Come on over, come on over here

Woah woah, what if this is all the love you ever get?
Woah woah, you'd not worry so much about counting your regrets
Woah woah, what if this is all the love I'm ever shown
Woah woah, I'd not be so scared to run into the unknown

So you've fallen in love
So you've fallen apart
What if it hurts like hell
Then it'll hurt like hell
Come on over, come on over here
I'm in the ruins too
I know the wreckage so well
Come on over, come on over here

What if this is all the love you ever get?
What if this is all the love you ever get

The first snow
First winter of my life
I was told it was the height of me
The first dance
Well, the first one that counted
Felt like my blood was built from crackling lights

All this ancient wildness
That we don't understand
The first sound of a heartbeat
To riots roaring on

This is not the love you've had before
This is something else
This is something else
This is not the same as other days
This is something else
This is something else
It shouldn't need to be so fucking hard
This is life on earth
It's just life on earth
It doesn't need to be the end of you, or me
This is life on earth
It's just life on earth
The first light
First light on the silent shore
Just the ships that anchor me and you
The way home
This is always the way home
So you can rip that map to shreds, my dear

But all we ever wanted
Seemed miles and miles from here
And the first days in a strange new land
Awaken beasts in us

This is not the love you've had before
This is something else
This is something else
This is not the same as other days
This is something else
This is something else
It shouldn't need to be so fucking hard
This is life on earth
It's just life on earth
It doesn't need to be the end of you, or me
This is life on earth
It's just life on earth
It shouldn't need to be so fucking hard
This is life on earth
It's just life on earth
It doesn't need to be the end of you, or me

All this feels strange and untrue
And I won't waste a minute without you
My bones ache, my skin feels cold
And I'm getting so tired and so old
The anger swells in my guts
And I won't feel these slices and cuts
I want so much to open your eyes
'Cause I need you to look into mine

Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes

Get up, get out, get away from these liars
'Cause they don't get your soul or your fire
Take my hand, knot your fingers through mine
And we'll walk from this dark room for the last time
Every minute from this minute now
We can do what we like anywhere
I want so much to open your eyes
'Cause I need you to look into mine

You're angry but you don't know how to be that yet
It seems too much went wrong and all at once
Resistance seems impossible from down this low
And surely no one else can feel like this

But on the streets
You can see them gathering
And in your heart
You know they feel like you do

Sound and pulse and volume
Hands just reaching out for hands
This is almost overload
I said almost overload
Friends and foes and princes
Are all just human in the end
This is so damn simple, yeah
It's so damn simple

So standing in the steady throne of restless hope
You don't feel like an outcast anymore
And something deep inside of you has waken up
And you know that nothing's gonna be the same again
And on the streets
You can see for what seems miles
Because in your heart
You know they feel like you do

Sound and pulse and volume
Hands just reaching out for hands
This is almost overload
I said almost overload
Friends and foes and princes
Are all just human in the end
This is so damn simple, yeah

You don't think it will

I find the map and draw a straight line
Over rivers, farms, and state lines
The distance from "A" to where you'd "B"
It's only finger-lengths that I see
I touch the place
Where I'd find your face
My fingers in creases
Of distant dark places

I hang my coat up in the first bar
There is no peace that I've found so far
The laughter penetrates my silence
As drunken men find flaws in science
Their words, mostly noises
Ghosts with just voices
Your words in my memory
Are like music to me

And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground and I
I pray that somethin' picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms
After I have travelled so far
We'd set the fire to the third bar
We'd share each other like an island
Until exhausted, close our eyelids
And dreaming, pick up from
The last place we left off
Your soft skin is weepin'
A joy you can't keep in

And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground and I
I pray that somethin' picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms
And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground and I
I pray that somethin' picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

You could be happy and I won't know
But you weren't happy the day I watched you go
And all of the things that I wish I had not said
Are played in loops 'til it's madness in my head
Is it too late to remind you how we were?
Not our last days of silent screamin' blur
Most of what I remember makes me sure
I should have stopped you from walkin' out the door

You could be happy, I hope you are
You made me happier than I'd been by far
Somehow everything I own smells of you
And for the tiniest moment it's all not true
Do the things that you always wanted to
Without me there to hold you back, don't think, just do
More than anything I want to see you, girl
Take a glorious bite out of the whole world

Can you heal me, baby?
I’ve been dancing in this fire for way too long
But I kind of like it
Oh I like it 'cause it's more dangerous than me
There’s a siren somewhere
But I’m pretty sure it’s only in my head
So tell me how'd you hear it?
Is there something supernatural in your bones?

Oh this is love like wildness coursing through you like a drug
And this is hurt like kindness breaking you with gentle hands

I call out your name, it feels like a song I know so well
And it whispers and roars like an orchestra
You call out my name like no one before, it sounds like I...
Am called to a home that I never had

Can you heal me, baby?
I've been wasted in the arms of everyone
I wasn't looking for you
But I think maybe I was and didn’t know
Oh this is love like wildness coursing through you like a drug
And this is hurt like kindness breaking you with gentle hands

I call out your name, it feels like a song I know so well
It whispers and roars like an orchestra
You call out my name like no one before, it sounds like I...

Please don't let this turn into somethin' it's not
I can only give you everything I've got
I can't be as sorry as you think I should
But I still love you more than anyone else could

All that I keep thinkin' throughout this whole flight
Is it could take my whole damn life to make this right
This splintered mast I'm holdin' on won't save me long
Because I know fine well that what I did was wrong

The last girl and the last reason
To make this last for as long as I could
First kiss and the first time
That I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you taught me
To look past everything I had ever learned
The final word in the final sentence
You ever uttered to me was "love"

We have got through so much worse than this before
What's so different this time that you can't ignore?
You say it is much more than just my last mistake
And we should spend some time apart for both our sakes
The last girl and the last reason
To make this last for as long as I could
First kiss and the first time
That I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you taught me
To look past everything I had ever learned
The final word in the final sentence
You ever uttered to me was "love"
The last girl and the last reason
To make this last for as long as I could
First kiss and the first time
That I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you taught me
To look past everything I had ever learned
The final word in the final sentence
You ever uttered to me was "love"

And I don't know where to look
My words just break and melt
Please just save me from this darkness
Please just save me from this darkness
And I don't know where to look

It's like we just can't help ourselves
Cause we don't know how to back down
We were called out to the streets
We were called out to the towns
How the heavens they opened up
Like arms of dazzling gold
With our rain-washed histories
Well, we do not need to be told

Show me now, show me the arms aloft
Every eye, trained on a different star
This magic, this drunken semaphore, and I

We are listening and we're not blind
This is your life, this your time
We are listening and were not blind
This is your life, this is your time

I was called out in the dark
By a choir of beautiful cheats
And as the kids took back the parks
You and I were left with the streets
Show me now, show me the arms aloft
Every eye, trained on a different star
This magic, this drunken semaphore, and I

We are listening and we're not blind
This is your life, this your time
We are listening and were not blind
This is your life, this is your time
We are listening and we're not blind
This is your life, this is your time

Verse 1:
I'm running out of ways to make you see
I want you to stay here beside me
I won't be okay and I won't pretend I am
So just tell me today and take my hand
Please take my hand
Please take my hand
Please take my hand

Just say yes
Just say there's nothing holding you back

Only love
Verse 2:
It's so simple and you know it is
You know it is
We can't be to and fro like this
All our lives
You're the only way to me

If you were here beside me
Instead of in New York
If the curve of you was curved on me
I'd tell you that I loved you
Before I even knew you
'Cause I loved the simple thought of you

If our hearts are never broken
And there's no joy in the mending
There's so much this hurt can teach us both
And there's distance and there's silence
Your words have never left me
They're the prayer that I say every day

Come on, come out, come here, come here
Come on, come out, come here, come here
Come on, come out, come here, come here
Come on, come out, come here, come here

The lone neon lights and the ache of the ocean
And the fire that was starting to spark
I miss it all, from the love to the lightning
And the lack of it snaps me in two
If you were here beside me
Instead of in New York
In the arms you said you'd never leave
I'd tell you that it's simple
And it was only ever thus
There is nowhere else that I belong

Come on, come out, come here, come here
Come on, come out, come here, come here
Come on, come out, come here, come here
Come on, come out, come here, come here

The lone neon lights and the ache of the ocean
And the fire that was starting to spark
I miss it all, from the love to the lightning
And the lack of it snaps me in two

Just give me a sign, there's an end with a beginning
To the quiet chaos driving me back
The lone neon lights and the warmth of the ocean
And the fire that has started to go out4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Part I: What If This Storm Ends?

What if this storm ends and I don't see you
As you are now, ever again?
A perfect halo of gold hair and lightning
Sets you off against the planet's last dance
Just for a minute, the silver forked sky
Lifts you up like a star that I will follow
And now it's found us like I have found you
I don't want to run, just overwhelm me

What if this storm ends and leaves us nothing
Except a memory? A distant echo
I want pinned down, I want unsettled
Rattle cage after cage until my blood boils
I want to see you as you are now
Every single day that I am living
Painted in flames, all peeling thunder
Be the lightning in me that strikes relentless

What if this storm ends and I don't see you
As you are now, ever again?
A perfect halo of gold hair and lightning
Sets you off against the planet's last dance
Just for a minute, the silver forked sky
Lifts you up like a star that I will follow
And now it's found us like I have found you
I don't want to run, just overwhelm me
Part II: The Sunlight Through the Flags

From here, the caravans are kids' toys
And I can hold them all in my palm
I watch the sea creep 'round the corner
It connects the dots from here to you
The sunlight burning through the loose flags
Painted high on white church walls
I chase my blood from brain to thumped heart
Until I'm out of breath for trying

Worry not, everything is sound
This is the safest place you've found
The only noise beating out is ours
Lacing our tea from honey jars

These accidents of faith and nature
They tend to stick in the spokes of you
But every now and then, the trend bucks
And you're repaired by more than glue
Worry not, everything is sound
This is the safest place you've found
The only noise beating out is ours
Lacing our tea from honey jars
Why don't you rest your fragile bones?
A minute ago, you looked alone
Stop waving your arms, you're safe and dry
Breathe in and drink up the winter sky
Part III: Daybreak

Slowly, the day breaks
Apart in our hands
And soft hallelujahs
Flow in from the church
The one on the corner
You said frightened you
It was too dark and too large
To find your soul in

Something was bound to go right, sometime today
All these broken pieces fit together
To make a perfect picture of us
It got cold and then dark, so suddenly and rained
It rained so hard, the two of us were the only thing
That we could see for miles and miles
And in the middle of the flood, I felt my worth
When you held onto me like I was your little life raft
Please know that you were mine as well
Drops of water hit the ground like God's own tears
And spread out into shapes like salad bowls
And basins and buckets for bailing out the flood

As motionless cars rust
On driveways and curbs
You take off your raincoat
And stretch out your arms
We both laugh out loud
And surrender to it
The sheer force of sky
And the cold magnet Earth

Something was bound to go right, sometime today
All these broken pieces fit together
To make a perfect picture of us
It got cold and then dark, so suddenly and rained
It rained so hard, the two of us were the only thing
That we could see for miles and miles
And in the middle of the flood, I felt my worth
When you held onto me like I was your little life raft
Please know that you were mine as well
Drops of water hit the ground like God's own tears
And spread out into shapes like salad bowls
And basins and buckets for bailing out the flood

This could be the very minute
I'm aware I'm alive
All these places feel like home
With a name I'd never chosen
I can make my first steps
As a child of 25
This is the straw
Final straw in the
Roof of my mouth
As I lie to you
Just because I'm sorry doesn't mean
I didn't enjoy it at the time
You're the only thing that I love
Scares me more every day
On my knees I think clearer
Goodness knows I saw it coming
Or at least I'll claim I did
But in truth, I'm lost for words
What have I done?
It's too late for that
What have I become?
Truth is nothing yet
A simple mistake starts the hardest time
I promise I'll do anything you ask

The perfect words never crossed my mind
'Cause there was nothing in there but you
I felt every ounce of me screaming out
But the sound was trapped deep in me
All I wanted just sped right past me
While I was rooted fast to the earth
I could be stuck here for a thousand years
Without your arms to drag me out

There you are, standing right in front of me
There you are, standing right in front of me
All this fear falls away to leave me naked
Hold me close, 'cause I need you to guide me to safety

No, I won't wait forever
No, I won't wait forever

In the confusion and the aftermath
You are my signal fire
The only resolution and the only joy
Is the faint spark of forgiveness in your eyes
There you are, standing right in front of me
There you are, standing right in front of me
All this fear falls away to leave me naked
Hold me close, 'cause I need you to guide me to safety
There you are, standing right in front of me
There you are, standing right in front of me

Hold me close, 'cause I need you to guide me to safety

Soon you'll not remember anything
But then someday neither will I
Tomorrow though is nothing to fear
Because father it's always today

Life won't flash before your eyes
Instead will fall away then melt like snow
The secret storms of your wild youth
Now just gentle breezes, warm and faint

Soon you'll not remember anything
But then some day neither will I
Tomorrow though is nothing to fear
Because father it's always today

I can ride on your coat tails again
Like I always did as a little boy
We are standing on the home shores now
My whole hand hanging onto your thumb
There's a place in the palace of you
We can always be standing like that
We could hide in there, just as we were then
Just my father and I am just your son
Your son
Your son
