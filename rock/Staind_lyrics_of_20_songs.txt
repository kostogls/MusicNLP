And it's been awhile since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile since I first saw you
And it's been awhile since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile since I could call you

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that are rendered
I've stretched myself beyond my means

And it's been awhile since I could say that I wasn't addicted and
It's been awhile since I could say I love myself as well and
It's been awhile since I've gone and fucked things up, just like I always do
And it's been awhile, but all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again, again

Why must I feel this way?
Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day
And it's been awhile since I could look at myself straight
And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile, but I can still remember just the way you taste

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem to be, and I know it's me
I cannot blame this on my father
He did the best he could for me

And it's been awhile since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry29EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

And you can bring me to my knees again
All the times that I could beg you please in vain
All the times that I felt insecure for you
And I leave my burdens at the door

But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in
I can see through you, see your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
I can see through you, see to the real you

All the times that I felt like this won't end, it's for you
And I taste what I could never have, it was from you
All the times that I've cried
My intentions, full of pride
But I waste more time than anyone

But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in
I can see through you, see your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
I can see through you, see to the real you

All the times that I've cried
All this wasted, it's all inside
And I feel all this pain
Stuffed it down, it's back again
And I lie here in bed
All alone, I can't mend
But I feel tomorrow will be okay
But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in
I can see through you, see your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
I can see through you, see to the real you12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

This is my life
It's not what it was before
All these feelings I've shared
And these are my dreams
That I'd never lived before
Somebody shake me, 'cause I
I must be sleeping

And now that we're here, it's so far away
All the struggle we thought was in vain
And all the mistakes one life contained
They all finally start to go away
And now that we're here, it's so far away
And I feel like I can face the day
And I can forgive, and I'm not ashamed
To be the person that I am today

And these are my words
That I've never said before
I think I'm doing okay
And this is the smile
That I've never shown before
Somebody shake me 'cause I
I must be sleeping
Now that we're here, it's so far away
All the struggle we thought was in vain
And all the mistakes one life contained
They all finally start to go away
And now that we're here, it's so far away
And I feel like I can face the day
And I can forgive, and I'm not ashamed
To be the person that I am today

I'm so afraid of waking
Please don't shake me
Afraid of waking
Please don't shake me

Now that we're here, it's so far away
All the struggle we thought was in vain
All the mistakes one life contained
They all finally start to go away
And now that we're here, it's so far away
And I feel like I can face the day
I can forgive, and I'm not ashamed
To be the person that I am today17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

So this is it, I say goodbye
To this chapter of my ever-changing life
And there's mistakes, the path is long
And I'm sure I'll answer for them when I'm gone

So when the day comes and the sun won't touch my face
Tell the ones who cared enough that I finally left this place

That's been so cold, look at my face
All the stories it will tell I can't erase
The road is long, just one more song
A little something to remind you when I'm gone
When I'm gone

The road to hell, along the way
Is paved with good intentions so they say
And some believe, that no good deed
Goes unpunished in the end or so it seems

So when the day comes and the sun won't touch my face
Tell the ones who care enough that I finally left this place
That's been so cold, look at my face
All the stories it will tell I can't erase
The road is long, just one more song
A little something to remind you when I'm gone
When I'm gone

So this is it, I say goodbye
To this chapter of my ever-changing life
And there's mistakes, the path was long
And I'm sure I'll answer for them when I'm gone
When I'm gone10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Your words to me just a whisper
Your face is so unclear
I try to pay attention
Your words just disappear

Oh
'Cause it's always raining in my head
Oh
Forget all the things I should have said

So I speak to you in riddles
'Cause my words get in my way
I smoke the whole thing to my head
And feel it wash away

'Cause I can't take anymore of this
I wanna come apart
Or dig myself a little hole
Inside your precious heart

Oh
'Cause it's always raining in my head
Oh
Forget all the things I should have said
I am nothing more than
A little boy inside
That cries out for attention
Yet I always try to hide

'Cause I talk to you like children
Though I don't know how I feel
But I know I'll do the right thing
If the right thing is revealed

'Cause it's always raining in my head
Forget all the things I should have said6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You take away

You take away

All the promises you made
To me you made in vain
I lost myself inside your
Tainted smile again

'Cause you can't feel my anger
You can't feel my pain
You can't feel my torment
Drivin' me insane
I can't fight these feelin's
They will bring you pain
You can't take away
Make me whole again

I feel betrayed
Stuck in your ways
And you rip me apart
With the brutal things you say
I can't deal with this shit anymore
I just look away
'Cause you can't feel my anger
You can't feel my pain
You can't feel my torment
Drivin' me insane
I can't fight these feelin's

You promised only pain
If you take away
And leave me with nothing again

You can't feel my pain
You can't feel my torment

To my mother, to my father
It's your son or, it's your daughter
Are my screams, loud enough for
You to hear me, should I turn this up for you
I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence, gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast

Your silence, is what kills me
I need someone, here to help me
But you don't know, how to listen
And let me make, my decisions

I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence, gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast

All your insults, and your curses
Make me feel like I'm not a person
And I feel like, I am nothing
But you made me, so do something
'Cause I'm fucked up, because you are
Need attention, attention you couldn't give
'Cause I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence, gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast
I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence, gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I know I've been mistaken
But just give me a break and see the changes that I've made
I've got some imperfections
But how could you collect them all and throw them in my face?

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
And if you chose to walk away
I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say
To keep you right here waiting

I hope you're not intending
To be so condescending, it's as much as I can take
But you're so independent
You just refuse to bend so I keep bending 'til I break

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
If you chose to walk away
I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say
To keep you right here waiting
I've made a commitment
I'm willing to bleed for you
I needed fulfillment
I found what I need in you
Why can't you just forgive me?
I don't want to relive all the mistakes I've made
Along the way
But I always find a way
To keep you right here waiting
I always find the words to say
To keep you right here waiting

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
And if I chose to walk away
Would you be right here waiting?
Searching for the things to say
To keep me right here waiting16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I try to breathe
Memories overtaking me
I try to face them but
The thought is too much to conceive

I only know that I can change
Everything else just stays the same
So now I step out of the darkness
That my life became 'cause

I just needed someone to talk to
You were just too busy with yourself
You were never there for me to
Express how I felt, I just stuffed it down
Now I'm older and I feel like
I could let some of this anger fade
But it seems the surface I am scratching
Is the bed that I have made

So where were you?
When all this I was going through
You never took the time
To ask me just what you could do
I only know that I can change
Everything else just stays the same
So now I step out of the darkness
That my life became cause

I just needed someone to talk to
You were just too busy with yourself
You were never there for me to
Express how I felt, I just stuffed it down
Now I'm older and I feel like
I could let some of this anger fade
But it seems the surface I am scratching
Is the bed that I have made

Oh, I never meant to fade
Away
I never meant to fade

I just needed someone to talk to
You were just too busy with yourself
You were never there for me to
Express how I felt, I just stuffed it down
Now I'm older and I feel like
I could let some of this anger fade
But it seems the surface I am scratching
Is the bed that I have made

Well, I want you to notice
To notice when I'm not around
I know that your eyes see straight through me
And speak to me without a sound

And I want to hold you
Protect you from all of the things I've already endured
And I want to show you
Show you all the things, that this life has in store for you
And I'll always love you
The way that a father, should love his daughter

When I walked out this morning
I cried as I walked to the door
I cried about how long I'd be away for
I cried about leaving you all alone

And I want to hold you
Protect you from all of the things I've already endured
And I want to show you
Show you all the things, that this life has in store for you
And I'll always love you
The way that a father, should love his daughter
Sweet Zoe Jane
Sweet Zoe Jane

So I wanted to say this
'Cause I wouldn't know where to begin
To explain to you what I have been through
To explain where your daddy has been

So I want to hold you
Protect you from all of the things I've already endured
And I want to show you
Show you all the things, that this life has in store for you
And I'll always love you
The way that a father, should love his daughter

If you just walked away
What could I really say?
And would it matter anyway?
Would it change how you feel?

I am the mess you chose
The closet you cannot close
The devil in you I suppose
Because the wounds never heal

But everything changes, if I could
Turn back the years, if you could
Learn to forgive me, then I could
Learn to feel

Sometimes the things I say
In moments of disarray
Succumbing to the games we play
To make sure that it's real

But everything changes, if I could
Turn back the years, if you could
Learn to forgive me, then I could
Learn to feel
When it's just me and you
Who knows what we could do
If we can just make it through
The toughest part of the day

But everything changes, if I could
Turn back the years, if you could
Learn to forgive me, then I could
Learn how to feel, and we could
Stay here together, and we could
Conquer the world, and we could
Say that forever is more than just a word

If you just walked away
What could I really say?
And would it matter anyway?
It wouldn't change how you feel4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You're my world, the shelter from the rain
You're the pills, that take away my pain
You're the light, that helps me find my way
You're the words, when I have nothing to say

And in this world where nothing else is true
Here I am still tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you
Still tangled up in you

You're the fire, that warms me when I'm cold
You're the hand I have to hold, as I grow old
You're the shore, when I am lost at sea
You're the only thing that I like, about me

And in this world where nothing else is true
Here I am still tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you

How long has it been
Since this storyline began
And I hope it never ends
And goes like this forever
In this world where nothing else is true
Here I am, still tangled up in you
Tangled up in you

I'm still tangled up in you
Still tangled up in you4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I force myself through another day, can't explain the way
Today just fell apart like everything, right in my face
And I try to be the one, I can't accept this all
Because of you I've had to walk away, from everything

And I'm afraid to be alone
Afraid you'd leave me when I'm gone
I'm afraid to come back home

Another sleepless night again, Hotel rooms my only friend
And friends like that just don't add up, to anything
And I try so hard to be, everything that I should never
Take away from you again, 'cause I heard you say

And I'm afraid to be alone
Afraid you'd leave me when I'm gone
I'm afraid to come back home

I cannot forget
I live with regret
I cannot forget
I live with...
I live through this
I can't see through this
I can't do this
Anymore
'Cause I'm afraid to be alone
Afraid you'd leave me when I'm gone
I'm afraid to come back home

Afraid you'd leave me when I'm gone
And I just wish i was back home1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Your mother came up to me
She wanted answers only she should know
Only she should know
It wasn't easy to deal
With the tears that rolled down her face
I had no answers 'cause, I didn't even know you

But these words, they can't replace
The life you, the life you waste

How could you paint this picture?
Was life as bad as it should seem
That there were no more options for you?
I can't explain how I feel
I've been there many times before
I've tasted the cold steel of my life crashing down before me

But these words, they can't replace
The life you, the life you waste

Did Daddy not love you?
Or did he love you just too much?
Did he control you?
Did he live through you at your cost?
Did he leave no questions
For you to answer on your own?
Well, fuck that, and fuck her, and fuck him, and fuck you
For not having the strength in your heart to pull through
I've had doubts, I have failed, I've fucked up, I've had plans
Doesn't mean I should take my life with my own hands

But these words, they can't replace
The life you, the life you waste

Well, I know the words
But I can't really speak them
To you
And I hide all the pain
That I've gained with my wisdom
From you
And I'm eaten alive
By what I hold inside
All the things that I live with
I can't easily hide
And I'm left here with nothing
Nothing to live for
But you

It's not easy to hide
All this damage inside
And I'll carry you with me
Until I'm not alive

When you look at my face
Does it seem just as ugly
To you?
I can't seem to erase
All the scars I have lived with
From you
I'm so sick of this place
This taste in my mouth
'Cause of you I can't figure

As I walk along these streets
I see a man that walks alone
Distant echo of people's feet
He has no place to call his own
A shot rings out from a roof overhead
A crackhead asks for change nearby
An old man lies in an alleyway dead
A little girl lost just stands there and cries

What would you do (What would you do)
If it was you (If it was you)
Would you take everything
For granted like you do

A boy just 13 on the corner for sale
Swallows his pride for another hit
Overpopulation there's no room in jail
And most of you don't give a shit
That your daughters are porno stars
And your sons sell death to kids
So lost in your little worlds
Your little worlds you'll never fix
What would you do (What would you do)
If it was you (If it was you)
Would you take everything
For granted like you do

You turn away
You turn away
You turn away
You turn away

As I walk along the streets
Soaking up the acid rain
Underneath the taxicabs
I hear the streets cry out in vain

What would you do (What would you do)
If it was you (If it was you)
Would you take everything
For granted like you do

If ever you had said to me before that I would lead this life
That I am living now I guess it's all so strange to feel the way I do inside
And have so much that I could feel some pride for in my life
So why is it that I feel like this

How do I feel? I've been here before, I've felt this
Retreat to a place, a place within me, I need this
Keep it all down, bottled inside, it breaks me
To torment again and torture me like it used to

I try and try to break away from all the hate I'm feeling
For everyone of you that's ever done me wrong
I need to justify the reasons for the way I'm living
I guess I can't 'cause I don't feel like I deserve

How do I feel? I've been here before, I've felt this
Retreat to a place, a place within me, I need this
Keep it all down, bottled inside, it breaks me
To torment again and torture me like it used to
My life is the 23rd hour of day
Once said that everything goes, by yesterday
So now the waves they have subsided and my soul is bleeding
I can't take away all the shame I feel, forgive me

How do I feel? I've been here before, I've felt this
Retreat to a place, a place within me, I need this
Keep it all down, bottled inside, it breaks me
To torment again and torture me like it used to
