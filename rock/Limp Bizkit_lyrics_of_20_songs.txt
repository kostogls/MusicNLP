It's just one of those days when you don't wanna wake up
Everything is fucked, everybody sucks
You don't really know why, but you wanna justify
Rippin' someone's head off
No human contact, and if you interact
Your life is on contract
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!
It's just one of those days

It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit talkin' that shit

It's just one of those days, feelin' like a freight train
First one to complain leaves with a blood stain
Damn right, I'm a maniac, you better watch your back
'Cause I'm fuckin' up your program!
And if you're stuck up, you're just lucked up
Next in line to get fucked up
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!
It's just one of those days
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit talkin' that shit
Punk, so come and get it

I feel like shit
My suggestion is to keep your distance
'Cause right now I'm dangerous
We've all felt like shit and been treated like shit
All those motherfuckers that want to step up
I hope you know I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps goin' this way
I just might break somethin' tonight
I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps goin' this way
I just might break somethin' tonight
I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps goin' this way
I just might break your fuckin' face tonight!
Give me somethin' to break
Give me somethin' to break
Just give me somethin' to break
How 'bout your fuckin' face?
I hope you know I pack a chainsaw (What?)
A chainsaw (What?)
A motherfuckin' chainsaw (What?)
So come and get it
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit talkin' that shit, punk
So come and get it21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be fated
To telling only lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you
No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through
But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free
Discover
L-I-M-P, say it, discover
L-I-M-P, say it, discover
L-I-M-P, say it, discover
L-I-M-P, say it, discover
No one knows what it's like
To be mistreated
To be defeated
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows how to say
That they're sorry
And don't worry
I'm not tellin' lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free
No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes30EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Check, one, one, two

I came into this world as a reject
Look into these eyes, then you'll see the size of the flames (Size of 'em!)
Dwellin' on the past, (Past!) it's burnin' on my brain (Hot!)
Everyone that burns has to learn from the pain
Hey, I think about the day (Days!)
My girlie ran away with my pay when fellas came to (Play!) play
Now, she's stuck with my homies that she fucked (Ooh!)
And I'm just a sucker with a lump in my throat, hey

Like a chump
(Hey!) I'm like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) I'm like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!)

Should I be feelin' bad? (No!) Should I be feelin' good? (No!)
It's kinda sad, I'm the laughin' stock of the neighborhood
And you would think that I'd be movin' on (Move it!)
But I'm a sucker, like I said, fucked up in the head, not!
And maybe, she just made a mistake
And I should give her a break, my heart'll ache either way
Hey, what the hell, what you want me to say?
I won't lie, that I can't deny
I did it all for the nookie (Come on!)
The nookie (Come on!)
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)

So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)

Stick it up your…

Why did it take so long?
Why, did I wait so long, huh?
To figure it out, but I did it
And I'm the only one underneath the sun who didn't get it
I can't believe that I could be deceived (But you were!)
By my so-called girl, but in reality
Had a hidden agenda
She put my tender heart in a blender, and still, I surrendered
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) I'm like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) I'm like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump

I did it all for the nookie (Come on!)

The nookie (Come on!)
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your…

I'm only human
It's so easy for your friends to give you their advice
They'll tell you, "Just let it go!"
It's easier said than done
I appreciate it, I do, but
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Just leave me alone
And nothing gonna change, you can go away
I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same
And nothing gonna change, so you can go away
And I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same
And nothing gonna change, so you can go away
And I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same
I did it all for the nookie (Come on!)

"Mr. Durst?"
"Yeah?"
"We need your help. Pulling into the diner about now should be four top-secret agents. One of them is carrying a briefcase. Your mission is to obtain the disc from the briefcase."

All the tension in the world today
All the little girls fillin' up the world today
When the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good
But I'ma live my life like I should (Like I should)
Now all the critics wanna hit it
Ya shit can how we did it, just because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted, new era committed
Now this red cap gets a rap from these critics
But do we always gotta cry?
Do we always gotta live inside a lie?
Life's just a blast that's movin' really fast
You better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass
Follow me into a solo
Remember that, kid? So what you wanna do?
And where you gonna run when you're starin' down the cable of a
Mic pointed at your grill like a gun?
Limp Bizkit is rockin' the set
It's like Russian Roulette, when you're placin', you bet
So don't be upset when you're broke and you're done
'Cause I'ma be the one till I jet (I'ma be the one till I jet)
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
Now I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

And now you wanna hate me!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!
And now you wanna hate me!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

Does anybody really know the secret?
Or the combination for this life and where they keep it?
It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
But everything happens for a reason (Everything happens for a reason)
I don't even know what I should say
'Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' up my mind every second with my fists
And everybody wanna run (Wanna run)
Everybody wanna hide from the gun (Hide from the gun)
You can take that ride through this life, if you want
But you can't take the edge off the knife (No, sir!)
And now you want your money back (Your money back)
But you're denied 'cause your brain's fried from the sack
And there ain't nothin' I can do
'Cause life is a lesson, you learn it when you're through
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
Now I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

And now you wanna hate me!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!
And now you wanna hate me!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

(Shhhhhh...)
Now I know why
Now I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)
Now I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)
Now I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)

Now I know why you wanna hate me!
Now I know why you wanna hate me!
Now I know why you wanna hate me!

DJ Premier
Uh, uh, uh

Who could be the boss? Look up to the cross
Stranded in the land of the lost
Standin' up, I'm sideways
I'm blazin' up the path, runnin' on the highways of rap
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal
A lotta stamps and brands, we like a bar code
I'm bashin' all the media strikes to keep the media dykes
As reinforcement for the fight
And that alone'll keep John Gotti on the phone
I'm tangled in the zone, I got the bees on the track
Where the fuck you at? (Tical!)
Let me hear you pigeons run ya mouth now (Shut the fuck up!)
I'm pluggin' in them social skills that keep my total bills
Over a million the last time I checked it
Thank God, I'm blessed with a mind that'll wreck it
Wait until the second round and knock 'em out

They call me Big John Studd, my middle name Mud
Dirty water flow, too much for you thug
They can't stand the flood – what up, doc?
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd,  the sureshot
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged (learn!)
Temperatures too hot for sunblock (burn!)
Playin' wit' minds that get you state time
Locked behind 12 bars from a great mind
Killa bees in the club wit' this ladybug
Brought a sword to the dance floor to cut a rug
Love is love all day, 'til they throw slugs
And take another life in cold blood, can't feel me 'til its your blood
Murder rates tremendous, crime is endless
Same shit different day, Father forgive us
They know not what they do, all praise is due
I'm big like E-Z and Big Bambu
What's that? I didn't hear you
Shut the fuck up!
Come on, a little louder!
Shut the fuck up!
Everybody in together now
Shut the fuck up!
What, huh?
Just shut the fuck up, just shut the fuck up!
What's that? I didn't hear you
Shut the fuck up!
Come on, a little louder!
Shut the fuck up!
Everybody in together now
Shut the fuck up!
What, huh?
Just shut the fuck up, just shut the fuck up!

Headstrong, dead calm, Dead by Dawn
Dead weight, they dead wrong, let's get it on
Twelve rounds of throw down – who hold crown?
Protect land wit' four pound, Limp Bizkit
Get around like merry-go, bust a scenario
Comin' through your stereo, why risk it?
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted
Eight essential vitamins and minerals, delicious
Word on the street is, they bit my thesis
Knocked out they front teefes, tryin' to taste mine
Actin' like they heard it through the grapevine
Dope fiendin' for the bassline, to provide rhyme
Pharmaceuticals, hard as nails to the cuticles
Where'd you find that monster? She beautiful
Wu-Tang and Limp Bizkit, roll on the set
Kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, and then jet
Mic check, so what's it all about? And where we gonna run?
Maybe we can meet up on the sun
Discretion is advised for the blood of virgin eyes
We limpin' on the track with the Method
So get the sunblock, you gettin' one-shot
Until you dissolve, I revolve around everything you got
From outta nowhere, prepare, you be blinded by the glare
I told you not to stare, now you're turned into stone
Without a microphone, but don't you forget you're in a zone
So shut the fuck up, and take that shit back
'Cause all your shit's wack (Doo doo is doo doo)
When its weighed out like that
Burnin' up your brain like a piston
So all those that didn't listen
Never even knew what they were missin'
And never even knew that the sky was fallin' down
Wu-Tang-Clan for the crown

What's that? I didn't hear you
Shut the fuck up!
Come on, a little louder!
Shut the fuck up!
Everybody in together now
Shut the fuck up!
What, huh?
Just shut the fuck up, just shut the fuck up!
What's that? I didn't hear you
Shut the fuck up!
Come on, a little louder!
Shut the fuck up!
Everybody in together now
Shut the fuck up!
What, huh?
Just shut the fuck up, just shut the fuck up!
It was over your head – all day, every day
S.I.N.Y. 10304
Wu-Tang Killa Bees
And the Limp B-I-Z-K-I-T
Y'all know the time, y'all know the rhyme
It ain't easy bein' greazy in a world full of cleanliness
And, you know, all that other madness
We gone, peace!
Limp Bizkit, Method Man
Rock the house y'all! Bring it on!

Hey wait up, where you guys goin'?
You're not recordin', are you?
Are you?
But I'm all alone
I can't do this!
Feel it, uh
Feel it, feel it, feel it
You guys feel it out there?
Shake your head if you feel it
Hey, hey, hey
Every day is brighter than the next day
At least that's what you think
Every day is brighter than the next day
At least that's what you think15EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Redman! (That's right, y'all!) Method Man!
We just keep on rollin, baby!

Now move in, now move out, hands up or hands down

Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Uh!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'

Now I know y'all be lovin this shit right here
L-I-M-P, Bizkit is right here
People in the house, put them hands in the air
'Cause if you don't care, then we don't care! (Yeah)
See, I ain't givin' a fuck, quit pressin' your luck
Untouchable, branded unfuckable
So keep me in this cage until you run that mouth
Then I'mma have the plague and break the fuck out
And then we'll see who's left, after one round with X
And what am I bringin' next? Just know it's Red and Meth
So where the fuck you at, punk? Shut the fuck up!

Oh what, y'all thought y'all wasn't gon' see me?

Check my dangerous slang atrocious
When I let these nuts hang, focus, it's Wu-Tang
What the fuck's a Hootie and the Blowfish?
I wave my Black Flag at the roaches
Who approaches, these twin, supersoakers
Who have poisonous darts for culprits
Too late to get your blow gun un-holstered
You're left buttered up and lightly toasted
So what, I drink and smoke too much
So what I cuss too much, shut the fuck up!
Now when we roll, you motherfuckers tuck in your gold
'Cause for the platinum, I'm jackin' niggas up in limos
It ain't nothin', for bullets to unbutton your clothes
Description, yellow male, tissue up in his nose
You bitches, swing the vine on the baboon nuts
I'm hairy as hell, outta hell and tattooed up
I'm a dog only fuck in the bathroom, what?
In high school, I dealt only with the classroom sluts

My name is Johnny, Donnie Brasco
Tuck the gat low, cut your cash flow
Yell if you want money, funny
A hungry dummy snatch crumbs from me
Docs and Hot Nix, bodies in the mosh pit

And I'm the D.O., you lookin' at the raw invented
On Friday, I spit 35 to 40 minutes
Smell up the bathroom like Craig pa was in it
Endin' up on your back, Wu swords up in it
Anyone can match me, I crack 'em all to Guinness
Fuck how many thugs players and ballers in it
Brick City, Shaolin, better call us sinners
Boys that'll run up in your wife, maul and spill it
AAAAAAAHHHHH!
C'mon!

Now move in, now move out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Breathe in, now breathe out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now (C'mon!)

Quicker than the hair-trigga, so if you dare nigga (Uh! C'mon!)
It'll be like your man tryin' to hold yo' brain to yo' head
But you'll be shittin' on yourself, 'cause you already dead
And at the funeral you won't need a casket (Uh!)
Leavin' just enough of him to stuff in a basket (Uh! Uh!)
A tisket a tasket, I really need my ass kicked (What?! What?!)
My moms never let me forget, that I'm a bastard (What?!)
I ain't never been shit, and ain't gon' be shit (Uh! Uh!)

This is dedicated to you Ben Stiller
You are my favorite motherfucker!
I told you, didn't I?

Drama makes the world go around
Does anybody got a problem with that? (Yeah)
My business is my business
Who's guilty? Can I get a witness?
First things first
The Chocolate Starfish is my man Fred Durst
Access Hollywood, license to kill
A redneck fucker from Jacksonville
Bangin' on the dumpster funk
My microphone machete's in the back of my trunk
Rocker's who's steady with the he says, she says
And don't forget about the starfish navigation system
Don't hate me, I'm just an alien
With thirty seven tons of new millenium
Dum-diddie-dum, where's it coming from?
Mrs. Aguilera, come and get some!
Oh no, which way to go to the dance floor?
It's on my stereo, pay me no mind
I seen The Fight Club about twenty eight times
And I'm 'a keep my pants saggin'
Keep a skateboard, a spray can for the taggin'
And I'm 'a keep a lot of girls in my band wagon
'Cause I don't give a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane

(Life in the fast lane)
I'm just a crazy motherfucker livin' it up
Not giving a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane

Take two, hoo-haa!
Now who's the star sucker? I'm the Starfish
You silly motherfucker
Puff puff, give the marijuana cig, oops
I don't even smoke, but I love the way it smells
Here's a toast to the females
Sippin' lung champagne from a seashell
I think I gotta feel and pop his ass like a zit
With the starfish navigation system
I'm no cheap thrills, baby
Fill the briefcase with three dollar bills
I'm just an ordinary run of the mill fella
Spittin' out hella' mic skills
And I'm 'a keep my pants saggin'
Keep a skateboard, a spray can for the taggin'

But it's not easy to be alive (Life in the fast lane)
So don't be wasting none on my time!

This world is like a cage and I don't think it's fair
And I don't even think that anybody cares
It'll leave a hole (What?) down the side of me (What?)
And it'll leave a scar (What?), can anybody see? (What?)
That we gotta get it out (We gotta get it out)
We gotta get it out (We gotta get it out)

Flying like an eagle to my destiny

Looks like I'ma do everything myself
Maybe I could use some help
But hell, you want somethin' done right?
You gotta do it yourself!
Maybe life is up and down
But, my life's been what 'til now?
I crawled up your butt from hell
And that's when things got turned around
It used to be a lie, I used to feel pathetic and now I get it
What's done is done, you just leave it alone and don't regret it
Sometimes some things turn into dumb things
And that's when you put your foot down

Why did I have to go and meet somebody like you, like you?
Why did you have to go and hurt somebody like me, like me?
How could you do somebody like that? (like that)
Hope you know that I'm never comin' back (never comin' back)

Just think about it
Just think about it

Lately, I've been skeptical, silent when I would use to speak
Distant from all around me who witness me fail and become weak
Life is overwhelming, heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one to disappoint you when I don't fall down

But you don't understand when I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change
But you might need my hand when falling in your hole
Your disposition, I'll remember when I'm letting go
Of you and me, we're through and rearranged

It seems that you're not satisfied, there's too much on your mind
So you leave, and I can't believe all the bullshit that I find
Life is overwhelming, heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one to, disappoint you when I don't fall down

But you don't understand when I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change
But you might need my hand when falling in your hole
Your disposition, I'll remember when I'm letting go
Of you and me, we're through and rearranged
You and me, we're through and rearranged
You're no good for me
Thank God it's over
You make believe
That nothing is wrong until you're crying
And you make believe
That life is so long until you're dying
You make believe
That nothing is wrong until you're crying, crying on me
You make believe
That life is so long until you're dying, dying, dying on me!
You think that everybody's the same
I don't think that anybody's like you
(You ruin everything and you kept fucking with me)
You think that everybody's the same (Thank God it’s over, and I won’t be the same)
(You ruin everything and you kept fucking with me)
I don't think that anybody's like you (Thank God it’s over, and I won’t be the same)

You'll get knocked the fuck out!

I'm upset at the people who verbally rape us, we're talking
We try to ignore them, ignore them until they keep talking
They think that they're building an empire without us
Well we've got the torch now
We've got the fire to burn this motherfucker down, town, town
We've got the fire to burn this motherfucker down, town, town
Burn this motherfucker now, down, down!!

Hey man, wake up and smell the concrete
Strange to see you've changed, like the LB
Could be identity crisis, but I can't buy this
Reality bites but that's what life is
Pitiful you, your hideous behavior
Hate what God gave ya, fakin' all the flavor
Artificial minds seekin' out the new trends
Get in where you fit in
Quit thinkin' like a has-been diggin' in my culture
I'ma let me let your punks know I'm an old school soldier
With the funk flow, a damn shame wanna change yourself
Because you're sick of yourself, well I'm sick of you too!
Fake! You're a counterfeit!
Fake! You know we figured you out
Well I'm sick of you too!
Fake! You're a counterfeit!
Fake!

I wonder, I wonder, I wonder what it's like to be a clone
Doin' nothin', nothin' on my own
Alone in your misery, you're bitin' on my new style
Filed as a counterfeit goin' down in
History as nothin' but a copy cat
So if you're fakin' that you're phat, you need a ballbat
Right where your head is at
All your desperation causes separation
Now I grab the mic to intimidate
Your weakness screams from the limp on your siren
Phonies get the hint quick smacked with the funk-flick
Pain for the fakers fame can't maintain
Because you're sick of yourself, well I'm sick of you too!

Fake! You're a counterfeit!
Fake! You know we figured you out
Well I'm sick of you too!
Fake! You're a counterfeit!
Fake!
All these phonies...
You disregarded your life
You disrespected your friends
You've even stolen your appearance
From hangin' around with my family
But I should have never dropped my guard
So you could stab me in the back
But you were freakin' me out
Just freakin' me out, you wear a mask

Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
You're freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit
Freakin' me out, you wear a mask called counterfeit

Now you're steadily startin' to change
You wanna re-arrange your lifestyle, live like the wild child
With the vibe alive, you could lie to try and be so fly
A lie but you deny you're a fake!
You're a phony, you know we figured you out, fake!
You know we figured you out, figured you out, figured you out!

Uh
Aiight
Check
Slim, Shady, through the mic kid, Uh
Slim Shady, Oh

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
From a slip disk from a Limp Bizkit disk
I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts
So I get pissed and can't pick which wrist to slit
Little rich kids in cribs don't attempt this shit
So step back while I prep up to pimp this bitch
So I say to the girl, I'm like, "What up, girl? Shut up, girl!"
Then I showed her a cut up squirrel
She screamed "bloody murder" so loud everybody heard her
She slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer
I moved on to two blondes kissin' on a futon
"Yo, baby, what are you on?"
I looked at 'em both and I was like, "Look
Check this out, toots, I'm lookin' for Cookie Puss
I need to speak to him immediately
They played my video on MTV last week"
And just when I was thinking I was all that and then some
Here comes Fred Durst, "Now Shady, let me get some"
Who knows what galaxy I came from?
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare, you stay right there
I got the fever for the flavor of a single
See, me and Shady, I think we got it locked down
Shocked by the sound, I got you crusin' with your top down
These two blondes I offered them both a drink
And this you would think could get the party started
But instead the girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouth, smelled like somebody farted
So it was time for me to move on
Shady said the living room was a dance floor
So turn me loose, I was cuttin' the rug with this chick
Bumped into this dude who was a drunk and a prick
Rambling on about how he was gonna kill me, wow!
I spilled a drink on his shirt
But no, he insisted we should go
And before I could drop him, Shady had to clock him
The music stopped, the party stood in shock
I looked around, grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf

Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's going my way
Or no way at all
Why don't you...
Turn me loose
You better tell them to come reshingle the roof
‘Cause just keep giving me free drinks 'til I puke
Then Fred will ask me to lead sing in his group
I'm sitting at the bar and I'm not being approached
‘Cause Fred's over there stealing all of my hoes
"Yo, Fred, save me some"
I walked to these siamese twins
And asked to have a threesome
I told them two heads are better than one
Plus I respect how y'all roll together as one
Got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin
Stood up, like, "Wait, where are you goin'?!"
Well, three strikes and I'm out
And I just struck out two times in a row (Ow!)
I ain't trying no more, fuck it, I'm chillin'
Did a shot of Jäger, fell asleep on the ceiling

Who knows what galaxy I came from?
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare, you stay right there
I got the fever for the flavor of a single
See, me and Shady, I think we got it locked down
Shocked by the sound, I got you crusin' with your top down

Yeah, ah, check this!
Kid (come on!)
Check this! (Fuck you!)

Wakin' up, aggravated
Stupid shit, man, I hate it
Bitches lyin', bitches cryin'
Suicidal, get in line
Gettin' mine, bouncin' freaks
Losin' sleep, countin' sheep
Absolute, cash and loot
Man in black, packin' heat
Born and blazin', rotten raisin'
Fingers up, time to wave 'em
Show these players playin'
That they better get their ass to prayin'
They won't be nothin' but dice
After the cuttin', I'm guttin' 'em
Like a fish, they're gonna wish
They never pushed my button

The door is shuttin' and a knock will do you no good
You're gettin' nothin' while I rock here in Hollywood
I'll tell you somethin' else, you can take it to the bank
I don't give a fuck what none of y'all people think
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra

Oh, that's right!
Yeah, that's right! (shut the fuck up!)

Feelin' Korn, goin' blind
Free as hell, doin' time
I'm insane, can't complain
Flush you turds down the drain
Down the hatch, throwin' craps
Throwin' matches on the gas
Check the math, check the wheels
Check the ride, pay the bills
Burnin' miles, harder smile
If you're feelin' versatile
Verses wild, flippin' bitches
Grindin' trucks, skatin' ditches
Hatin' hard, but hardly hatin'
Knife and slice your shit like bacon
Sick and tired, you is fired
I'm the truth, and you's the liar
The door is shuttin' and a knock will do you no good
You're gettin' nothin' while I rock here in Hollywood
I'll tell you somethin' else, you can take it to the bank
I don't give a fuck what none of y'all people think

Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra

Oh yeah, listen what I'm tellin' you (I'm telling you)
There's only one king on this hill, it sure as hell ain't you
Oh yeah, listen what I'm tellin' you (I'm telling you)
There's only one king on this hill, it sure as hell ain't you (yeah!)

Holdin' the gold, it's gold, it's so golden y'all, Golden Cobra
