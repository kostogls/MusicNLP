Last night I heard lepers
Flinch like birth defects
Its musk was fecal in origin
As the words dribbled off of its chin
Which said "I'm lost, I'm lost"

Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost

Dolls wreck the minced meat of pupils
Cast in oblong arms length
The hooks have been picking their scabs
Where wolves hide in the company of men
Which said "I'm lost, I'm lost"
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost
Now I'm lost

Are you peaking in the red?
Perforated at the neck
What of this mongrel architect
A broken arm of sewers set
Past present and future tense
Clip side of the pink-eyed fountain

Tarantism (0:00-0:39)

Plant a Nail in the Navel Stream (0:39-4:46)

There was a frail syrup dripping off his lap danced lapel
Punctuated by her decrepit prowl she
Washed down the hatching gizzard
Soft as a mane of needles
His orifice icicles hemorrhaged by combing her torso to a pile
Perspired the trophy shelves made room for his collapse
She was a mink hand job in sarcophagus heels

Bring me to my knees, read the sharpened lines
All my arms bled me blind
Faucet leaks in shadows, spilling from
Morgue lancet caressed your fontanelle
I've sworn to kill every last one
Every last one
Panic in the shakes of the wounded, panic in the worms
Onto the floor, and out of your mouth and out of your eyelids
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches

All your dreams splintered off
Leech by leech on this catafalque
Anyone will tell you, yes, anyone
Chance had me setting a trip wire alarm
Your mother flirted with disease
When she skinned that costume by its navel strings
Panic in the shakes of the wounded, panic in the worms
Onto the floor, and out of your mouth and out of your eyelids

No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
Shockless shackles free you
Volt face cons
Abandon you again
I won't feel, not this time
Shockless shackles free you
Volt face cons
Abandon you again
I won't feel, not this time, oh, yeah!

Brick by brick the night eclipsed
Pricked by cuticle thorns
Dried the sleep of nursery slits
Into this life I'm born
Heaven's just a scab away
I'd like to see you after just one taste
Oh, oh, oh

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
Night forever more
Let them see it has begun
The others I've become
If you should see the dice
Charmed with its snaked choked eyes
You'll wear the widows weeds
Because they're just your size

Behind the snail secretion
Leaves a dry heave that absorbs
A limbless procreation
Let the infant crawl deformed
A bag replace the breath
Of these suffocating sheets
And now when the craving calls
I'll scratch my itchy sheath

And soon
Come on
If you don't know
Come on
If you don't know
Come on
If you don't know

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
Night forever more
Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
Night forever more

She fell for the whispers
Sister flooded deaf tears
That night tore a river
In her barren womb mirror
And his multiple sons
With their mandible tongues
Set crucified fires to petrified homes
L-L-L-L-L-L-L-Let it burn
I want, I want, I want, I want to let it burn

And the owls they were watching
And the owls didn't care
Then the owls came a' knocking
Placenta in their stares
They will feed on all the carnage
Leftover from the flood
And in the corner of their eyes
Fled sister L'Via
Sister L'Via

Now the pieces went floating
Reflecting all at dusk
Conceived from the stabbing
Was Vismund Cygnus

You can't bend your crooked arms
Or fold your punctured proof
The air is growing cold, cold, cold, cold, cold
And there's nothing you can do
Soon there'll be no gauze
Inside the confessional
Only rows of crows
Defrocking every breath, breath, breath, breath

One day you'll remember
Behind the melting cones
I said one day you'll remember
Behind the melting cones
You've always had a family
In the burial of your home
In the burial of your home
Burial of your home
Burial of your home, ffffph

Night forevermore

And I peel back all of my skin
Peel it back let it all run
Peel back all of my skin

Ruse of metacarpi

Those nicotine stains on his every word
My scavenger quilt will only hide the truth
Bring me, bring me this plague

I count the days to find what was left behind
Only these names I clutch will lead me to my home
Somehow this river marks a wrinkle hand in mine
And everyday that parts the water into two
Mothers and feathers start to drown the living proof
I can't remember these lakes of blood
Wrapped in a blanket there sweats a cut
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

He's got fasting black lungs
Made of clove splintered shards
They're the kind that will talk
Through a wheezing of coughs
And I hear him every night, in every pore
And every time he just makes me warm

Freeze without an answer
Free from all the shame
Must I hide? 'Cause I'll never, never sleep alone

Look at how they flock to him
From an isle of open sores
He knows that the taste is such
Such to die for
And I hear him every night on every street
The scales that do slither deliver me from

Freeze without an answer
Free from all the shame
Then I'll hide, 'cause I'll never, never sleep alone
Oh lord, said I'm, said I'm, said I'm
Said I'm, bloodshot for sure
Pale runs the ghost, said I'm, said I'm
Swollen on the shore, swollen on the shore
In every night, in every pore
The scales that do slither deliver me from

Then I'll hide, 'cause I'll never, never sleep alone

Stuck in his neck to the gills
Fragments of sobriquets

Crescent in shape has escaped

The house half the way
Fell empty with teeth

Was he robbed of the asphalt that cushioned his face?

Hid in a safe

Hadn't found the speaking so wrong

Rationed a dead letter pure

Track-marked amoeba lands craft, cartwheel of scratches
Dress the tapeworm as pet

Comfort in the breathing wrong

As if suggested beck and call
This face and heel
Will drag your halo through the mud ash of Pompeii
Erupted in a statue's dust
Shrouded in veils
Because these handcuffs hurt too much
Still scalping this ticketless applause
And when they drag the lake
There's nothing left at all

Beyond the anthills of the dawning of this plague

The gates of Thanos are-a spread eagle wide
You let the shutters make sackcloth and ashes
Out of a blind man's picaresque heart

You'll find the ossuary (You better fight now)

Where thumbs hide inside of sleeping bag mouths
Ad-libbing memoirs, casting a drought

Pour Another Icepick

I always wanted
To eat glass with you again
But I never knew how
How to talk without
Walls dropping on the eave
The nest they made couldn't break you
Along the fallen
Scowled a fence of beaks
But the temple is scathing
Through your veins
They were scaling
Through an ice pick of abscess reckoning

And when Miranda sang
Everyone turned away
Used to the noose they obey

And whoever said that they would scatter
Separating the mother from child
She can bat a broken eyelid
Raining maggots from its sty
And with the traces that she leaves
She will skin you out alive
All the children go grinding their jaws
The sweet smell of their toothless canals
And the dam she will break
Make an ocean from this lake
As they siphon off all our blood
And when Miranda sang
Everyone turned away
Used to the noose they obey


And when Miranda sang
Everyone turned away
Used to the noose they obey
And when Miranda sang
Everyone turned away
Used to the noose they obey

Tell me it's over, Rusbel awaits
I've been to the surface and nothing is there
Eyelids sank muffled in the nerve aura sound
But when she awakes, will she still be with us?
My heart is darkclots, leap year is late
How did you get here? Ask all but the bait
From a Christ that went hissing, constricting his cells
We summon by candle, by book and by bell

Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals
Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence

The sermon goes mourning pricking its hail
Slothful the child that preys on the seed
Shall behead the drought, wound under sleeves
I hope you have room in a thicket of vines
Give me a moment to claim what you've stole
The streets will hang high stretched ribs and let taste
We'll cover the smell with silver nitrate
Mending the cuts of your prosthetic faith
Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals
Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals

Then so long, dear mnemonic
Assume the form you've given me and I'll spill
Now hold on, just hold my hand
Say that they made you, but you brought your own leash
Tell me no more, no
Tell me no more, no

Outside by the drift
You read my will of thread and itch
Failure to comply as failure to decease
And still you won't know everything
I've built the fall

The sulking drained the fall of my pale will swarming by your steps
Licking the ankles of your blasphemer guilts
It only meant to drape a plastic over the stuck pig scalp of head
To cover the sock where the flatline had spread
The kiosk in my temporal lobe is shaped like Rosalynn Carter
She says my map is home again but torn face down
I have only but a million blemishes to tell you all about

In the end they just gagged me to make him come out

Gas me the hind of your five legged snare
Tooth picks the eye, but nothing's there
Down drags your waltz 'cross the altar top
From a sleep that deprivation knew
Trespass your form, I'm void of dusk
I'd ask to look, but the mask stays on
You'll levitate teutonic print
Cruelty is the wrath of my instrument

In the end they just gagged me to make him come out

You locked the cuffs, arsenic erupts
Will you drink the shadow of my red hair?
You and your false witness to God
You've one in the chamber, but your finger got stuck
Let slip the sound of a cry for help
But all was lost on the night you walked
Palms speak through eyes, serve your memory lost
I contaminate with insignias
In the end they just gagged me to make him come out

Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals

Wait 'til I get my hands on you
I won't forget a face that lift me
Just you wait 'til I get my hands on you
I can't, oh, oh, oh
You won't remember

Unwrap my corpse and let it thaw
In the eye of the needle I can't get out
They'll check my wrist, I'll faint a pulse
I'm not the human you thought I was
If you pet the night, sixth pentacle dice
If you roll the seven, St. Michael dies
They'll be no ransom, don't shut my mouth
I scald the answer you're afraid of3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It's been thirteen seconds since you all last said
I've become the apparition you predicted for my death
You said that flirting brings you closer to the end
You can bait into the water but you'll never get the hint
And like a stain of bricks goes dancing by your head
Plucked from an icebox, grafted on my skin
It's been thirteen seconds since you all last said
(Don't you worry)
I've become the apparition you predicted for my death
You said that flirting brings you closer to the end
(Don't you worry)
You can bait into the water but you'll never get the hint
And like a stain of bricks goes dancing by your head
(Don't you worry)
Plucked from an icebox, grafted on my skin

My coat has hid the marks, mink hits the shovel fix
Near the sway of pendulums, boar abrasions and a kiss
She said, "I'll never let them hurt you, I'll never let them in
What you took from me is mine and what is mine I'll never give"

Mascara glass in the molar weeds
Her ash, a serpent infancy
And his eye patch pussed through a gape of sand
Into his shine a sedative (Into his shine a sedative)
More and more the dirt collects
And you'll never find her body now
In a closet festered in secret air
Blonde underneath her blackened hair
And he never knew the colony
Gestated in his bed
Mingle with the carnivores
You've something both in common now
Till one day with his wasted breath
Swollen throat and karma debt
Set foot inside a parlor
To find her drunken by receipts
He held her by the ankles
Gutted at the nave
Yes gutted and depraved
He tied a rope around her legs
And let her hang for seven days

This never happened, but I saw you leave
And crawl into a bed of broken windows
This never happened, but I saw you leave
And crawl into a bed of broken windows
This never happened, but I saw you leave
And crawl into a bed of broken windows
This never happened

You came here on time
I just hope that it's not too late
I've seen you at night
Biting the frost of silence
Can you cure us of this fate?
Mock the litany in its face
Is that you, Moatilliatta?

I've been waiting for so long

Hex zero rouge
He'll hibernate no more
Altars run dry
Prefect dictate your final words
Does it sting of augur truth?
Was your temple left in ruins?
Is that you, Moatilliatta?

This is the altar
The one that you let me die in
On your knees
How you wept
Much like Omertà
The quiet has shielded all intent
On the ground it appears
Like a wrath
Avenging the lamb as bait
In a bed of nails you made
Who is this effigy?
Is there straw dressed in these fields?
And now it won't be long
I've been waiting for so long
For someone to
Mend all the blame
I've been searching for so long

That night I remember what you slipped in my glass
We came rewinding when
I foamed at the mouth while the lights winked at me
And now my shape is kept
The rain it can't hide, wash the paint from this hex
Is it so permanent?
Did she catch a left eye when it blinks three times
Or once just to seal you in?

In your drunken breath, did it stain like us?
In place of poison heat
I gotta rid this world of your intention
Swap the corpse in the casket

Give me that corpse please
The one that tore nightly
I really want it now
Fold the arms slowly
Don't want you to hold me
It fits just like a glove
Does he make you alright?

When I seep inside your truth through suspicious little coughs
You sank your nails inside a key while the door you shut closed up
The black stockings you kept, smell of wet cigarette
Torn of lust that you could not keep
I have slept inside your fault to have you keep me here on this leash
For the rest of your pets, I will feed to this theft
As we consummate the vows of defeat
And when you pray for an end to this
I do believe this is eternity
Give me that corpse please
The one that tore nightly
I really want it now
Fold the arms slowly
Don't want you to hold me
It fits just like a glove
Your closet is bulging
White marrow withholding
Does it make you feel alright?

Never heard a man speak like this man before
Never heard a man speak like this man before
All the days of my life, ever since I've been born
Never heard a man speak like this man before
Watch me now


Say it, say it, say it loud
Say it, say it, say it loud
Hold your heavy burden
In a pocket full of drink that I have drunk
Spit the remnants in your direction
This is the closest to any kingdom that you will come

I'm starting to feel a miscarriage coming on
It's numbing a stump clearing in my throat
And I just can't lose grip of it
She fumigated my mental hygiene
I'm all out of pulse
But I know you can resuscitate me

Never heard a man speak like this man before

All the days of my life, ever since I've been born

Sawing off the pavement
Repenting their past lives
Might I be the only payment left
To be left behind
Clay and pigment footsteps
Rust it boiling clean
Our bull let in linguistics
That only we can breathe

I got a prayer that'll make you theirs now
Beneath sepulchers
Raise your entrails as an offer
I got a prayer that'll make you theirs now
Beneath sepulchers
Raise your entrails as an offer

Fondling with pitchforks
In a cattle prodded sea
Signaling the sedatives
To emaciate their queen
Bowing in constriction
Anytime you leave
We snuffed ourselves an angel
And cut her by the wings
I got a prayer that'll make you theirs now
Beneath sepulchers
Raise your entrails as an offer
I got a prayer that'll make you theirs now
Beneath sepulchers
Raise your entrails as an offer

In my sight I was born
To bring death at the footsteps of your home
Tonight I have sewn
All the hair and crooked nails
That you all have worn
While your wife sits at home
I plant the vermin
Because she needs it so

How long must we fold by hand
The nuns are burning wheels again
Dent of mattress to make it bare
Come clean with the anecdote
After all we came undone
Pale of sluts with host at fault
One day we won't pay your debt
Our centipedes will get theirs yet
Poachers in your home
Poachers in your home
Poachers in your home
Poachers in your home

How long must we fold by hand
The nuns are burning wheels again
Dent of mattress to make it bare
Come clean with the anecdote
After all we came undone
Pale of sluts with host at fault
One day we won't pay your debt
Our centipedes will get theirs yet
How long must we fold by hand
The nuns are burning wheels again
Dent of mattress to make it bare
Come clean with the anecdote
After all we came undone
Pale of sluts with host at fault
One day we won't pay your debt
Our centipedes will get theirs yet

Fold the river by the lips
As a cruel and smothered wind
Fits the gash with ornaments
Dawn is nodding off again
Raised the braille to read it clear
Gathered by the cholera
Rinse the burns in cauldrons
Help the palm we see a lens
My hands secrete a monument
My hands secrete a monument
My hands secrete a monument
My hands, hands, hands, hands
My hands secrete a monument
My hands secrete a monument
My hands secrete a monument
My my my my
I am the reason
For your missing child
They might be home
But there's no trace
Under your pillow
I have left a spine
Oh the things we do
When you're away
I saw the message
That you wrote in the sand
Dismembered hints that carve away
The anesthetic of your gospel said
Put a muzzle on the lamb
Put a muzzle on the lamb
Give me one page, give me one page
Make it blank, mace that I leak will rain
Give me one page, give me one page
Make it blank. race I inflict your way
Maybe one day you'll stop and realize
The throne that you serve is dead
Give me a plague, give me a plague
Make it blank, nothing you own is safe

How long must we fold by hand
The nuns are burning wheels again
Dent of mattress to make it bare
Come clean with the anecdote
After all we came undone
Pale of sluts with host at fault
One day we won't pay your debt
Our centipedes will get theirs yet
How long must we fold by hand
The nuns are burning wheels again
Dent of mattress to make it bare
Come clean with the anecdote
After all we came undone
Pale of sluts with host at fault
One day we won't pay your debt
