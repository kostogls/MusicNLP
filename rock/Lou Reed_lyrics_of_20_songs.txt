Holly came from Miami, F-L-A
Hitchhiked her way across the U.S.A
Plucked her eyebrows on the way
Shaved her legs and then he was a she

She says, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
Said, "Hey honey, take a walk on the wild side"

Candy came from out on the Island
In the backroom, she was everybody's darling
But she never lost her head
Even when she was giving head

She says, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
Said, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"

And the colored girls go
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Dooh)
Little Joe never once gave it away
Everybody had to pay and pay
A hustle here and a hustle there
New York City is the place where they said

"Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "Hey Joe, take a walk on the wild side"

Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
Looking for soul food and a place to eat
Went to the Apollo
You should've seen him go, go, go

They said, "Hey sugar, take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
Alright, huh

Jackie is just speeding away
Thought she was James Dean for a day
Then I guess she had to crash
Valium would've helped that bash
She said, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "Hey honey, take a walk on the wild side"

And the colored girls say
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Just a perfect day
Drink Sangria in the park
And then later, when it gets dark we go home
Just a perfect day
Feed animals in the zoo
Then later, a movie too and then home

Oh it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on

Just a perfect day
Problems all left alone
Weekenders on our own, it's such fun
Just a perfect day
You made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else, someone good

Oh it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on
You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow

You know, man, when I was a young man in high school
You believe it or not, I wanted to play football for the coach
And all those older guys
They said that he was mean and cruel, but you know
Wanted to play football for the coach
They said I was a little too light weight to play linebacker
So's I'm playing right end
Wanted to play football for the coach
'Cause, you know some day, man
You gotta stand up straight unless you're gonna fall
Then you're going to die
And the straightest dude
I ever knew was standing right for me all the time
So I had to play football for the coach
And I wanted to play football for the coach

When you're all alone and lonely in your midnight hour
And you find that your soul has been up for sale
And you begin to think about a-a-all the things that you've done
And you begin to hate just about everything
But remember the princess who lived on the hill
Who loved you even though she knew you was wrong
And right now she just might come shining through
And the glory of love, glory of love
Glory of love just might come through

And all your two-bit friends have gone and ripped you off
They're talking behind your back saying, man
You ain't never going to be no human being
And you start thinking again
About all those things that you've done
And who it was and what it was
And all the different things you made every different scene
Ah, but remember that the city is a funny place
Something like a circus or a sewer
And just remember different people have peculiar tastes

And the glory of love
The glory of love
The glory of love might see you through
Yeah, but now, now
Glory of love
The glory of love
The glory of love might see you through
Glory of love, ah huh huh
The glory of love
Glory of love, glory of love
Glory of love, now, glory of love, now
Glory of love, now, now, now, glory of love
Glory of love, give it to me now
Glory of love'll see you through
Oh, my Coney Island baby, now
(I'm a Coney Island baby, now)
I'd like to send this one out to Lou and Rachel
And all the kids and P.S. 192
Coney Island baby
Man, I'd swear, I'd give the whole thing up for youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Part A: Waltzing Matilda

Waltzing Matilda whipped out her wallet
Sexy boys smiled in dismay
She took out four twenties 'cause she liked round figures
Everybody's queen for a day

Oh babe, I'm on fire and you know I admire your body
Why don't we slip away?
Although I'm sure you're certain, it's a rarity me flirtin'
Sha la la la this way
Oh sha la la la la - sha la la la la
Hey baby
Come on, let's slip away

Luscious and gorgeous, oh what a humping muscle
Call out the National Guard
She creamed in her jeans as he picked up her knees
From off of the Formica topped bar

And cascading slowly, he lifted her wholly and boldly
Out of this world
And despite people's derision proved to be more than diversion
And sha la la la la later on
And then sha la la la la la
He entered her slowly and showed her where he was coming from
And then sha la la la la, he made love to her gently
It was like she'd never ever come
And then sha la la la la, sha la la la la
When the sun rose and he made to leave
You know sha la la la la, sha la la la la
Neither one regretted a thing
Part B: Street Hassle
Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm
Slip away
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh

Hey, that cunt's not breathing
I think she's had too much of something or other
Hey, man, you know what I mean?
I don't mean to scare you
But you're the one who came here
And you're the one who's gotta take her when you leave

I'm not being smart or trying to be cold on my part
And I'm not gonna wear my heart on my sleeve
But you know people get all emotional
And sometimes man they just don't act rationally
Oh, they think they're just on TV
Sha la la la, man
Why don't you just slip her away

You know, I'm glad that we met man
It was really nice talking
And I really wish that there was a little more time to speak
But you know it could be a hassle
Trying to explain myself to a police officer
About how it was your old lady got herself stiffed

And it's not like we could help
But there was nothing no one could do
And if there was, man, you know I would have been the first
Oh when someone turns that blue
Well, it's a universal truth
Then you just know that bitch will never fuck again

By the way, that's really some bad shit
That you came to our place with
But you ought to be more careful around the little girls
It's either the best or it's the worst
And since I don't have to choose, I guess I won't
And I know this ain't no way to treat a guest
But why don't you grab your old lady by the feet
And just lay her out in the darkest street
And by morning, she's just another hit and run
You know, some people got no choice
And they can never find a voice
To talk with that they can even call their own
So the first thing that they see
That allows them the right to be
Why they follow it
You know, it's called bad luck
Part C: Slipaway
Well hey man, that's just a lie
It's the lie she tells her friends
'Cause a real song
The real song she won't even admit to herself
The beating in her heart
It's a song lots of people know
It's a painful song
With a load of sad truth
But life's full of sad songs
Penny for a wish
But wishin' won't make you so, Joe
But a pretty kiss or a pretty face can't have its way
Joe, tramps like us, we were born to pay

Love has gone away
And there's no one here now
And there's nothing left to say
But oh how I miss him, baby
Oh baby, come on and slip away
Come on baby, why don't you slip away?

Love has gone away
Took the rings off my fingers
And there's nothing left to say
But oh how, oh how I need it, baby
Come on baby, I need you, baby
Oh, please don't slip away
I need your loving so bad, babe
Please don't slip away1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You want me to hit you with a stick
But all I've got's a guitar pick
Heh, baby, you're so vicious

When I watch you come, baby, I just wanna run, far away
You're not the kind of person 'round I wanna stay
When I see you walking down the street
I step on your hands and I mangle your feet

If I could be anything in the world that flew
I would be a bat and come swooping after you
And if the last time you were here things were a bit askew
Well, you know what happens after dark
When rattlesnakes lose their skins and their hearts
And all the missionaries lose their bark
Oh, all the trees are calling after you
And all the venom snipers after you
Are all the mountains boulder after you

If I could be any one of the things
In this world that bite
Instead of a dentured ocelot on a leash
I'd rather be a kite
And be tied to the end of your string
And flying in the air, baby, at night
'Cause you know what they say about honey bears
When you shave off all their baby hair
You have a hairy minded pink bare bear
And all the bells are rolling out for you
And stones are all erupting out for you
And all the cheap bloodsuckers are flying after you
Yesterday, Daisy Mae and Biff
Were groovin' on the street
And just like in a movie
Her hands became her feet
Her belly button was her mouth
Which meant she tasted what she'd speak, ooohhh
But the funny thing is what happened to her nose, ooohhh
It grew until it reached all of her toes, ooohhh
Now, when people say her feet smell, they mean her nose
And curtains laced with diamonds, dear for you
And all the Roman noblemen for you
And kingdom's Christian soldiers, dear for you
And melting ice cap mountain tops for you
Oh oh, and knights in flaming silver robes for you
And bats that with a kiss turn prince for you

Swoop swoop, oh baby, rock rock

I am a chorus of the voices
That gather up the magnets
Set before me
I attract you and repel you
A science of the heart
And blood and meaning
The coldness of most beauties is a challenge that our youth must quickly conquer
There is no time for guilt
Or second guessing, second guessing
Based on feeling
I am the truth, the beauty
That causes you to cross
Your sacred boundaries
I have no morals
Some think me cheap
And someone who despises
The normalcy of heartbreak, the purity of love
But I worship the young
And just formed angel
Who sits upon the pin of lust
Everything else bores me

I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up
Your life of reason
I want you on the floor
And in a coffin your soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning you've amassed like a fortune
Oh, throw it away
For worship of someone who actively despises you
For worship of someone who actively despises you!
I am the root!
I am the progress!
I'm the aggressor!
I am the tablet!
These ten stories!

Worship! Worship!
Pain and evil have their place sitting here beside me!
I offer them to you as servants
Of the gold that you must give!
Pain and evil have their place sitting here beside me!
And I will offer them, I offer them to you
As servants of the gold that you must give to me!

I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up
Your life of reason
I want to see you on the floor
And in a coffin, soul shaking, soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning you've amassed like a fortune
Like a fortune, throw it away
For worship of someone who actively despises you
Who actively despises you!
I am the view!
I am the table!
I am the view, I am the table!
I am all this!
I am the root!
The progress!
The aggressor!
I am the table!

Pedro lives out of the Wilshire Hotel
He looks out a window without glass
The walls are made of cardboard, newspapers on his feet
His father beats him cause he's too tired to beg
He's got 9 brothers and sisters
They're brought up on their knees
It's hard to run when a coat hanger beats you on the thighs
Pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man
But that's a slim chance he's going to the boulevard
He's going to end up, on the dirty boulevard
He's going out, to the dirty boulevard
He's going down, to the dirty boulevard
This room cost 2,000 dollars a month
You can believe it man it's true
Somewhere a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants
No one here dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything
They dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard
Give me your hungry, your tired your poor I'll piss on 'em
That's what the Statue of Bigotry says
Your poor huddled masses, let's club 'em to death
And get it over with and just dump 'em on the boulevard
Get 'em out, on the dirty boulevard
Going out, to the dirty boulevard
They're going down, on the dirty boulevard
Going out
Outside it's a bright night
There's an opera at Lincoln Center
Movie stars arrive by limousine
The klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of Manhattan
But the lights are out on the Mean Streets
A small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel
He's selling plastic roses for a buck
The traffic's backed up to 39th street
The TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck
And back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming
He's found a book on magic in a garbage can
He looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling
"At the count of 3" he says, "I hope I can disappear"
And fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly-fly-fly-fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly away
I want to fly
Fly, fly away
I want to fly
Fly-fly away (Fly a-)
Fly-fly-fly (-way, ooohhh...)
Fly-fly away (I want to fly-fly away)
Fly away (I want to fly, wow-woh, no, fly away)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

And then you open up your eyes
Then comes pancake factor number one
Eyeliner, rose hips and lip gloss, such fun

Rouge and coloring, incense and ice
Perfume and kisses, ooohhh, it's all so nice
You're a slick little girl

Now, we're coming out
Out of our closets
Out on the streets
Yeah, we're coming out

When you're in bed it's so wonderful
It'd be so nice to fall in love
When you get dressed I really get my fill
People say that it's impossible
Gowns lovely made out of lace
And all the things that you do to your face

Oh, you're a slick little girl
Eyeliner, whitener then color the eyes

Caroline says
As she gets up off the floor
Why is it that you beat me
It isn't any fun
Caroline says
As she makes up her eyes
You ought to learn more about yourself
Think more than just I

But she's not afraid to die
All of her friends call her "Alaska"
When she takes speed, they laugh and ask her
What is in her mind
What is in her mind

Caroline says
As she gets up from the floor
You can hit me all you want to
But I don't love you anymore
Caroline says
While biting her lip
Life is meant to be more than this
And this is a bum trip
But she's not afraid to die
All her friends call her "Alaska"
When she takes speed, they laugh and ask her
What is in her mind
What is in her mind

She put her fist through the window pane
It was such a funny feeling
It's so cold in Alaska
It's so cold in Alaska
It's so cold in Alaska1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Originally published by The Talkhouse on July 2, 2013
Kanye West is a child of social networking and hip-hop. And he knows about all kinds of music and popular culture. The guy has a real wide palette to play with. That's all over Yeezus. There are moments of supreme beauty and greatness on this record, and then some of it is the same old shit. But the guy really, really, really is talented. He's really trying to raise the bar. No one's near doing what he's doing, it's not even on the same planet
People say this album is minimal. And yeah, it's minimal. But the parts are maximal. Take "Blood on the Leaves." There's a lot going on there: horns, piano, bass, drums, electronic effects, all rhythmically matched — towards the end of the track, there's now twice as much sonic material. But Kanye stays unmoved while this mountain of sound grows around him. Such an enormous amount of work went into making this album. Each track is like making a movie
Actually, the whole album is like a movie, or a novel — each track segues into the next. This is not individual tracks sitting on their own island, all alone
Very often, he'll have this very monotonous section going and then, suddenly —"BAP! BAP! BAP! BAP!" — he disrupts the whole thing and we're on to something new that's absolutely incredible. That's architecture, that's structure — this guy is seriously smart. He keeps unbalancing you. He'll pile on all this sound and then suddenly pull it away, all the way to complete silence, and then there's a scream or a beautiful melody, right there in your face. That's what I call a sucker punch
He seems to have insinuated in a recent New York Times interview that My Beautiful Dark, Twisted Fantasy was to make up for stupid shit he'd done. And now, with this album, it's "Now that you like me, I'm going to make you unlike me." It's a dare. It's braggadoccio. Axl Rose has done that too, lots of people have. "I Am a God" — I mean, with a song title like that, he's just begging people to attack him
But why he starts the album off with that typical synth buzzsaw sound is beyond me, but what a sound it is, all gussied up and processed. I can't figure out why he would do that. It's like farting. It's another dare — I dare you to like this. Very perverse
Still, I have never thought of music as a challenge — you always figure, the audience is at least as smart as you are. You do this because you like it, you think what you're making is beautiful. And if you think it's beautiful, maybe they'll think it's beautiful. When I did Metal Machine Music, New York Times critic John Rockwell said, "This is really challenging." I never thought of it like that. I thought of it like, "Wow, if you like guitars, this is pure guitar, from beginning to end, in all its variations. And you're not stuck to one beat." That's what I thought. Not, "I'm going to challenge you to listen to something I made." I don't think West means that for a second, either. You make stuff because it's what you do and you love it
That explains the jump-cuts that are all over this record. Over and over, he sets you up so well — something's just got to happen — and he gives it to you, he hits you with these melodies. (He claims he doesn't have those melodic choruses anymore — that's not true. That melody the strings play at the end of "Guilt Trip," it's so beautiful, it makes me so emotional, it brings tears to my eyes.) But it's real fast cutting — boom, you're in it. Like at the end of "I Am a God," anybody else would have been out, but then pow, there's that coda with Justin Vernon, "Ain't no way I'm giving up." Un-fucking-believable. It's fantastic. Or that very repetitive part in "Send It Up" that goes on five times as long as it should and then it turns into this amazing thing, a sample of Beenie Man's "Stop Live in a De Pass."
And it works. It works because it's beautiful — you either like it or you don't — there's no reason why it's beautiful. I don't know any musician who sits down and thinks about this. He feels it, and either it moves you too, or it doesn't, and that's that. You can analyze it all you want
Many lyrics seem like the same old b.s. Maybe because he made up so much of it at the last minute. But it's the energy behind it, the aggression. Usually the Kanye lyrics I like are funny, and he's very funny here. Although he thinks that getting head from nuns and eating Asian pussy with sweet and sour sauce is funny, and it might be, to a 14-year-old — but it has nothing to do with me. Then there's the obligatory endless blowjobs and menages-a-trois
But it's just ridiculous that people are getting upset about "Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign"? C'mon, he's just having fun. That's no more serious than if he said he's going to drop a bomb on the Vatican. How can you take that seriously?
And then he'll come out with an amazing line like "We could have been somebody." He's paraphrasing that famous Marlon Brando line from On the Waterfront, "I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it. It was you, Charlie." Or he says "I'd rather be a dick than a swallower" — but then he does a whole
Chorus with Frank Ocean. What he says and what he does are often two different things
"Hold My Liquor" is just heartbreaking, and particularly coming from where it's coming from — listen to that incredibly poignant hook from a tough guy like Chief Keef, wow. At first, West says "I can hold my liquor" and then he says "I can't hold my liquor." This is classic — classic manic-depressive, going back and forth. Or as the great Delmore Schwartz said, "Being a manic depressive is like having brown hair."
"I'm great, I'm terrible, I'm great, I'm terrible." That's all over this record. And then that synthesized guitar solo on the last minute and a half of that song, he just lets it run, and it's devastating, absolutely majestic
There are more contradictions on "New Slaves," where he says "Fuck you and your Hamptons house." But God only knows how much he's spending wherever he is. He's trying to have it both ways — he's the upstart but he's got it all, so he frowns on it. Some people might say that makes him complicated, but it's not really that complicated. He kind of wants to retain his street cred even though he got so popular. And I think he thinks people are going to think he's become one of them — so he's going to very great lengths to claim that he's not. On "New Slaves," he's accusing everyone of being materialistic but you know, when guys do something like that, it's always like, "But we're the exception. It's all those other people, but we know better."
"New Slaves" has that line "Y'all throwin' contracts at me/ You know that niggas can't read." Wow, wow, wow. That is an amazing thing to put in a lyric. That's a serious accusation in the middle of this rant at other people: an accusation of himself. As if he's some piece of shit from the street who doesn't know nothing. Yeah, right — your mom was a college English professor
He starts off cool on that track but he winds up yelling at the top of his voice. I think he maybe had a couple of great lines already written for this song but then when he recorded the vocal, but then he just let loose with it and trusted his instincts. Because I can't imagine actually writing down most of these lines. But that's just me
But musically, he nails it beyond belief on"New Slaves." It's mainly just voice and one or two synths, very sparse, and then it suddenly breaks out into this incredible melodic… God knows what. Frank Ocean sings this soaring part, then it segues into a moody sample of some Hungarian rock band from the '70s. It literally gives me goosebumps. It's like the visuals at the end of the new Superman movie — just overwhelmingly incredible. I played it over and over
Some people ask why he's screaming on "I Am a God." It's not like a James Brown scream — it's a real scream of terror. It makes my hair stand on end. He knows they could turn on him in two seconds. By "they" I mean the public, the fickle audience. He could kill Taylor Swift and it would all be over
The juxtaposition of vocal tones on "Blood on the Leaves" is incredible — that pitched-up sample of Nina Simone singing "Strange Fruit" doing a call-and-response with Kanye's very relaxed Autotuned voice. That is fascinating, aurally, nothing short of spectacular. And holy shit, it's so gorgeous rhythmically, where sometimes the vocal parts are matched and sometimes they clash. He's so sad in this song. He's surrounded by everyone except the one he wants — he had this love ripped away from him, before he even knew it. "I know there ain't nothing wrong with me… something strange is happening." Well, surprise, surprise — welcome to the real world, Kanye
It's fascinating — it's very poignant, but there's nothing warm about it, sonically — it's really electronic, and after a while, his voice and the synth are virtually the same. But I don't think that's a statement about anything — it's just something he heard, and then he made it so you could hear it too
At so many points in this album, the music breaks into this melody, and it's glorious — I mean, glorious. He has to know that — why else would you do that? He's not just banging his head against the wall, but he acts as though he is. He doesn't want to seem precious, he wants to keep his cred
And sometimes it's like a synth orchestra. I've never heard anything like it — I've heard people try to do it but no way, it just comes out tacky. Kanye is there. It's like his video for "Runaway," with the ballet dancers — it was like, look out, this guy is making connections. You could bring one into the other — ballet into hip-hop — they're not actually contradictory, and he knew that, he could see it immediately. He obviously can hear that all styles are the same, somewhere deep in their heart, there's a connection. It's all the same shit, it's all music — that's what makes him great. If you like sound, listen to what he's giving you. Majestic and inspiring.12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Harry was a rich young man who would become a priest
He dug up his dear father who was recently deceased
He did it with tarot cards and a mystically attuned mind
And shortly therein after he did find
Jeanie was a spoiled young brat, she thought she knew it all
She smoked mentholated cigarettes and she had sex in the hall
But she was not my kind or even of my sign
The kind of animal that I would be about

Woh-woh-woh, you keep hangin' round me
And I'm not so glad you found me
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago, oh woh woh
You keep hangin' 'round me
And I'm not so glad you found me
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
All right now
Ah-huh-huh

Kathy was a bit surreal, she painted all her toes
And on her face she wore dentures clamped tightly to her nose
And when she finally spoke her twang her glasses broke
And no one else could smoke while she was in the room
Hark the herald angels sang and reached out for a phone
And plucking it with a knife in hand dialed long distance home
But it was all too much sprinkling angel dust
To AT&T who didn't wish you well

Oh, but you keep hangin' round me
And I'm not so glad you found me
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago, ho ho ho ho
You keep hangin' 'round me
And I'm not so glad you found me
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago

Hangin' 'round
Hangin' 'round, that's all you're doing baby
Hangin' 'round
Hangin' 'round, ooohhh
Hangin' 'round
Hangin' 'round
Hangin' 'round
Hangin' 'roundEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight
It's time to say goodbye, let me tell you now
Goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight
It's time to say goodbye

Now, all night long
You've been drinking your tequila
But now you've sucked your lemon peel dry
So why not get high, high, high and
Goodnight ladies
Ladies goodnight

Goodnight ladies, ah, ladies goodnight
It's time to say goodbye
Goodnight sweet ladies, ah, ladies goodnight
It's time to say goodbye, bye-bye

Ah, we've been together for the longest time
But now it's time to get high
Come on, let's get high, high, high
And goodnight ladies
Ladies goodnight
Oh, I'm still missing my other half
Oh, it must be something I did in the past
Don't it just make you wanna laugh
It's a lonely Saturday night

Oh, nobody calls me on the telephone
I put another record on my stereo
But I'm still singing a song of you
It's a lonely Saturday night

Now, if I was an actor
Or a dancer who is glamorous
Then, you know, an amorous life would soon be mine
But now the tinsel light of star break
Is all that's left to applaud my heart break
And at eleven o'clock I watch the network news

Oh, woh, woh, something tells me that you're really gone
You said we could be friends
But that's not what I want
Ah, anyway, my TV-dinner's almost done
It's a lonely Saturday night
I mean to tell you, it's a lonely Saturday night
One more once, it's a lonely Saturday night1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Caroline says that I'm just a toy
She wants a man, not just a boy
Oh, Caroline says, ooh, Caroline says
Caroline says she can't help but be mean
Or cruel, or oh so it seems
Oh, Caroline says, Caroline says

She says she doesn't want a man who leans
Still she is my Germanic Queen
Yeah, she's my Queen

The things she does, the things she says
People shouldn't treat others that way
But at first I thought I could take it all
Just like poison in a vial
Hey, she was often very vile
But of course, I thought I could take it all

Caroline says that I'm not a man
So she'll go get it catch as catch can
Oh, Caroline says, yeah, Caroline says
Caroline says moments in time
Can't continue to be only mine
Oh, Caroline says, yeah, Caroline says

She treats me like I am a fool
But to me she's still a German Queen
Ooh she's my Queen, ya
Queen, hey baby, she's still my Queen

In Berlin, by the wall
You were five foot ten inches tall
It was very nice
Candlelight and Dubonnet on ice
We were in a small cafe
You could hear the guitars play
It was very nice
It was paradise
You're right and I'm wrong
Hey babe, I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone
One sweet day
Oh, you're right and I'm wrong
You know I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone
One sweet day
One sweet day
In a small, small cafe
We could hear the guitars play
It was very nice
Candlelight and Dubonnet on ice
Don't forget, hire a vet
He hasn't had that much fun yet
It was very nice
Hey honey, it was paradise
You're right and I'm wrong
Oh babe, I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone
One sweet day
You're right, oh, and I'm wrong
You know I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone
One sweet day
One sweet day
One sweet day, one sweet day
Oh, one sweet day
One sweet day, baby-baby, one sweet day
One sweet day, one sweet dayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because she was making it with sisters and brothers
And everyone else, all of the others
Like cheap officers who would
Stand there and flirt in front of me

They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because of the things that they heard she had done
The black air force sergeant was not the first one
And all of the drugs she took
Every one, every one

And I am the water boy
The real game's not over here
But my heart is overflowin' anyway
I'm just a tired man
No words to say
But since she lost her daughter
It's her eyes that fill with water
And I am much happier this way
They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
'Cause number one was the girlfriend from Paris
The things that they did, ah, they didn't have to ask us
And then the Welshman from India
Who came here to stay

They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because of the things she did in the streets
In the alleys and bars, no she couldn't be beat
That miserable rotten slut couldn't turn
Anyone away

I am the water boy
The real game's not over here
But my heart is overflowin' anyway
I'm just a tired man
No words to say
But since she lost her daughter
It's her eyes that fill with water
And I am much happier this way1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When she walked on down the street
She was like a child staring at her feet
But when she passed the bar
And she heard the music play
She had to go in and sing
It had to be that way
She had to go in and sing
It had to be that way

And I said no, no, no
Oh, Lady Day
And I said no, no, no
Oh, Lady Day

After the applause had died down
And the people drifted away
She climbed down off the bar
And went out the door
To the hotel
That she called home
It had greenish walls
A bathroom in the hall
And I said no, no, no
Oh, Lady Day
And I said no, no, no
Oh, Lady Day
I said no, no, no
Oh, Lady Day
And I said no, no, no
Oh, Lady Day
And I said no, no, no
Oh, Lady Day
I said no, no, no
Oh, Lady Day
And I said no, no, no
Oh, Lady Day
And I said no, no, no
Oh, Lady DayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Staring at my picture book
She looks like Mary, Queen of Scots
She seemed very regal to me
Just goes to show how wrong you can be

I'm gonna stop wastin' my time
Somebody else would have broken both of her arms

Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song

My castle, kids and home
I thought she was Mary, Queen of Scots
I tried so very hard
Shows just how wrong you can be

I'm gonna stop wastin' my time
Somebody else would have broken both of her arms

Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song

Caught between the twisted stars
The plotted lines the faulty map
That brought Columbus to New York
Betwixt between the East and West
He calls on her wearing a leather vest
The earth squeals and shudders to a halt
A diamond crucifix in his ear
Is used to help ward off the fear
That he has left his soul in someone's rented car
Inside his pants he hides a mop
To clean the mess that he has dropped
Into the life of lithesome Juliette Bell
And Romeo wanted Juliette
And Juliette wanted Romeo
And Romeo wanted Juliette
And Juliette wanted Romeo
Romeo Rodriguez squares
His shoulders and curses Jesus
Runs a comb through his black pony-tail
He's thinking of his lonely room
The sink that by his bed gives off a stink
Then smells her perfume in his eyes
And her voice was like a bell
Outside the streets were steaming
The crack dealers were dreaming
Of an Uzi someone had just scored
I betcha I could hit that light
With my one good arm behind my back
Says little Joey Diaz
Brother give me another toke
Those downtown hoods are no damn good
Those Italians need a lesson to be taught
This cop who died in Harlem
You think they'd get the warnin'
I was dancing when I saw his brains run out on the street
And Romeo had Juliette
And Juliette had her Romeo
And Romeo had Juliette
And Juliette had her Romeo
I'll take Manhattan in a garbage bag
With Latin written on it that says
"it's hard to give a shit these days"
Manhattan's sinking like a rock
Into the filthy Hudson what a shock
They wrote a book about it
They said it was like ancient Rome
The perfume burned his eyes
Holding tightly to her thighs
And something flickered for a minute
And then it vanished and was gone1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
