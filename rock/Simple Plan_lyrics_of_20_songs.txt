Hey, dad, look at me
Think back and talk to me
Did I grow up according to plan?
And do you think I'm wasting my time
Doing things I wanna do?
But it hurts when you disapprove all along

And now I try hard to make it
I just wanna make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
Can't pretend that I'm alright
And you can't change me

'Cause we lost it all
Nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late
And we can't go back
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect

I try not to think
About the pain I feel inside
Did you know you used to be my hero?
All the days you spent with me
Now seem so far away
And it feels like you don't care anymore
And now I try hard to make it
I just wanna make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
I can't stand another fight
And nothing's alright

'Cause we lost it all
Nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late
And we can't go back
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect

Nothing's gonna change the things that you said
And nothing's gonna make this right again (Right again)
Please don't turn your back
I can't believe it's hard just to talk to you
But you don't understand (You don't understand)

'Cause we lost it all
Nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late
And we can't go back
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect
'Cause we lost it all
Nothing lasts forever
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect
Now it's just too late
And we can't go back
I'm sorry
I can't be perfect19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I woke up, it was seven, I waited 'til eleven
Just to figure out that no one would call
I think I've got a lot of friends, but I don't hear from them
What's another night all alone?
When you're spending everyday on your own
And here it goes

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me
Tonight

And maybe when the night is dead, I'll crawl into my bed
I'm staring at these four walls again
I'll try to think about the last time I had a good time
Everyone's got somewhere to go
And they're gonna leave me here on my own
And here it goes

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me
What the hell is wrong with me? Don't fit in with anybody
How did this happen to me?
Wide awake I'm bored and I can't fall asleep
And every night is the worst night ever

I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid, yeah, I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid
And I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid

I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Nobody wants to be alone in the world
I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Nobody wants to be alone in the world
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me tonight

I'm all alone tonight
Nobody cares tonight
'Cause I'm just a kid tonight10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
So jet-lagged

What time is it where you are?
I miss you more than anything
And back at home you feel so far
Waiting for the phone to ring
It's getting lonely living upside down
I don't even wanna be in this town
Tryna figure out the time zone's making me crazy

You say good morning when it's midnight
Going out of my head, alone in this bed
I wake up to your sunset, and it's driving me mad
I miss you so bad, and my heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged, is so jet-lagged

What time is it where you are?
Five more days and I'll be home
I keep your picture in my car
I hate the thought of you alone
I've been keeping busy all the time
Just to try to keep you off my mind
Tryna figure out the time zone's making me crazy
You say good morning when it's midnight
Going out of my head, alone in this bed
I wake up to your sunset, and it's driving me mad
I miss you so bad, and my heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged, is so jet-lagged

I miss you so bad (I miss you so bad)
I miss you so bad (I miss you so bad)
I miss you so bad (I wanna share your horizon)
I miss you so bad, and see the same sun rising
I miss you so bad and turn the hour hand back to when you were holding me

You say good morning when it's midnight
Going out of my head, alone in this bed
I wake up to your sunset, and it's driving me mad
I miss when you say good morning, but it's midnight
Going out of my head, alone in this bed
I wake up, to your sunset
And it's drivin' me mad, I miss you so bad
And my heart, heart, heart is so jet-lagged

Do you ever feel like breakin' down?
Do you ever feel out of place
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you?
Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room
With the radio on turned up so loud
That no one hears your screamin'?

No, you don't know what it's like
When nothin' feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breakin' down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life
Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feelin' so left out?
Are you desperate to find somethin' more
Before your life is over?
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With their big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside you're bleedin'

No, you don't know what it's like
When nothin' feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breakin' down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life
No one ever lied straight to your face
And no one ever stabbed you in the back
You might think I'm happy, but I'm not gonna be okay
Everybody always gave you what you wanted
You never had to work, it was always there
You don't know what it's like, what it's like

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breakin' down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like (What it's like)
To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down

I open my eyes
I try to see, but I’m blinded by the white light
I can’t remember how, I can’t remember why
I’m lying here tonight
And I can’t stand the pain
And I can’t make it go away
No, I can’t stand the pain

How could this happen to me?
I've made my mistakes
Got nowhere to run
The night goes on as I’m fading away
I’m sick of this life
I just wanna scream
How could this happen to me?

Everybody’s screaming
I try to make a sound, but no one hears me
I’m slipping off the edge, I’m hanging by a thread
I wanna start this over again
So I try to hold on to a time when nothing mattered
And I can’t explain what happened
And I can’t erase the things that I've done
No, I can’t
How could this happen to me?
I've made my mistakes
Got nowhere to run
The night goes on as I’m fading away
I’m sick of this life
I just wanna scream
How could this happen to me?

As I'm lifting up
Up above the clouds away from you

When I try to speak no words, lip-syncing
Hope this is not just wishful thinking

Another day is going by
I'm thinking about you all the time
But you're out there and I'm here waiting
And I wrote this letter in my head
'Cause so many things were left unsaid
But now you're gone and I can't think straight

This could be the one last chance to make you understand, yeah

I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
To try to make you laugh
'Cause somehow I can't put you in the past
I'd do anything
Just to fall asleep with you
Will you remember me?
'Cause I know I won't forget you

Together we broke all the rules
Dreaming of dropping out of school
And leave this place but never come back
So now, maybe after all these years
If you miss me, have no fear
I'll be here, I'll be waiting
This could be the one last chance to make you understand
And I just can't let you leave me once again, yeah

I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
To try to make you laugh
'Cause somehow I can't put you in the past

Can anybody hear me?
Or am I talking to myself?
My mind is running empty
In this search for someone else
Who doesn't look right through me
It's all just static in my head
Can anybody tell me why
I'm lonely like a satellite?

'Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut
Sending S.O.S. from this tiny box
And I lost all signal when I lifted off
Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot
Can I please come down? (Come down)
'Cause I'm tired of driftin' around and 'round (And 'round)
Can I please come down?

I'm deafened by the silence
Is it somethin' that I've done?
I know that there are millions
I can't be the only one
Who's so disconnected
It's so different in my head
Can anybody tell me why
I'm lonely like a satellite?
'Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut
Sending S.O.S. from this tiny box
And I lost all signal when I lifted off
Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot
Can I please come down?
'Cause I'm tired of driftin' around and 'round
Can I please come down?

Now I lie awake and scream, in the zero gravity
And it's starting to weigh down on me, whoa
Let's abort this mission now
Can I please come down?

So tonight I'm calling all astronauts
All the lonely people that the world forgot
If you hear my voice, come pick me up
Are you out there? 'Cause you're all I've got

And tonight, I'm feeling like an astronaut
Sending S.O.S. from this tiny box
And I lost all signal when I lifted off
Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot
'Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut
Sending S.O.S. from this tiny box
To the lonely people that the world forgot
Are you out there? 'Cause you're all I've got
Can I please come down?
(Please, please, please come down)
'Cause I'm tired of driftin' around and 'round

You might not think you're a supermodel
But you look like one to me
I'd rather have your picture on my phone
Than on the cover of a magazine
It's hard to think that a girl like you
Could have any insecurities
It's funny how all the things you would change
Are all things that are cute to me
And I know you don't believe me
And you think that I'm a fool
But I don't care

Maybe
You'll never see in you what I see
The little things you do that make me go crazy
I'm not crazy
You're perfectly perfect to me

You brush it off every time I tell you
Your smile lights up the room
And I'm guessing that you don't even notice
That the whole world notices you
You think you're clumsy, I think you're cool
You say you're typical, but I think you rule
Sometimes I wonder if you'll ever believe
That I wrote this song for you
Maybe
You'll never see in you what I see
The little things you do that make me go crazy
I'm not crazy
You're perfectly perfect
Someday
You're gonna see you're beautiful this way
And that you're always gonna make me go crazy
I'm not crazy
You’re perfectly perfect to me

You don't have to try
Change a single thing
'Cause just the way you are is sweeter than anything
Maybe I’m a fool, but it’s always been you
‘Cause no one ever makes me smile the way you do

Maybe
You'll never see in you what I see
The little things you do that make me go crazy

I wanna start by letting you know this
Because of you, my life has a purpose
You helped me be who I am today
I see myself in every word you say
Sometimes it feels like nobody gets me
Trapped in a world where everyone hates me
There's so much that I'm going through
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you

I was broken, I was choking, I was lost
This song saved my life
I was bleeding, stopped believing, could have died
This song saved my life
I was down, I was drowning, but it came on just in time
This song saved my life

Sometimes I feel like you've known me forever
You always know how to make me feel better
Because of you my dad and me
Are so much closer than we used to be
You're my escape when I'm stuck in a small town
I turn you up whenever I feel down
You let me know like no one else
That it's okay to be myself
I was broken, I was choking, I was lost
This song saved my life
I was bleeding, stopped believing, could have died
This song saved my life
I was down, I was drowning, but it came on just in time

When you're sitting there it's hard for me to look away
So i try to find the words that i could say
I know distance doesn't matter but you feel so far away
And I can't lie

Every time I leave my heart turns gray
And I wanna come back home to see your face tonight
Because I just can't take it

Another day without you with me
Is like a blade that cuts right through me
But I can wait
I can wait forever
When you call my heart stops beating
When you're gone it won't stop bleeding
But I can wait
I can wait forever

You look so beautiful today
It's like every time I turn around I see your face
The thing I miss the most is waking up next to you
When I look into your eyes
Man, I wish that I could stay and I can't lie
Every time I leave my heart turns gray
And I wanna come back home to see your face tonight
And I
Because I just can't take it

Another day without you with me
Is like a blade that cuts right through me
But I can wait
I can wait forever
When you call my heart stops beating
When you're gone it won't stop bleeding
But I can wait
I can wait forever

I know it feels like forever
I guess that's just the price I got to pay
But when I come back home to feel your touch
Makes it better
Until that day
There's nothing else that I can do
And I just can't take it
I just can't take it
Another day without you with me
Is like a blade that cuts right through me
But I can wait
I can wait forever
When you call my heart stops beating
When you're gone it won't stop bleeding
But I can wait
I can wait forever1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

No, I don't wanna be sad
I don't wanna be sad, sad, sad no more

It’s been 28 days since I’ve seen the sunshine
'Cause I just can't seem to lift this cloud away
I swear all the tears I’ve cried could fill an ocean
I've been swimming in a sea of misery

I can't find the strength to leave this bed
I’m locked up in my cuckoo head
I feel so low and I can't let go
I've got all the symptoms, all the signs
I tell my friends I'll be just fine
But truth be told, it’s getting old

No, I don't wanna be sad
I don't wanna be sad, sad, sad no more (No, no, no)
And I know some days will be bad
But I don't wanna be sad, sad, sad no more

I've tried every pill the doctor will prescribe me
And I've put myself through weeks of therapy (Seeks of therapy)
I've tried meditation, yoga and pilates
It's like happiness just wasn't meant for me (Wasn't meant for me)
But I’m through, I'm done, I've had enough
I'll ditch this funk, I tell you what
Just watch me now
'Cause I won’t back down
I've got a bad ass personality
So I just need to set it free
It starts today, I’m on my way

No, I don't wanna be sad
I don't wanna be sad, sad, sad no more (No, no, no)
And I know some days will be bad
But I don't wanna be sad, sad, sad no more

Ooohhh (No, no, no)
I don't wanna be sad
Ooohhh (No, no, no)
I don't wanna be sad
Ooohhh (No, no, no)
I don't wanna be sad
Sad, sad, sad, sad, sad
No, I don't wanna be sad
I don't wanna be sad, sad, sad no more
And I know some days will be bad
But I don't wanna be sad, sad, sad no more
No, I don't wanna be sad
I don't wanna be sad, sad, sad no more (No, no, no)
And I know some days will be bad
But I don't wanna be sad, sad, sad no more

Uuhh (No, no, no)
I don't wanna be
(No, no, no)
I don't wanna be sad, sad, sad no more
Uuhh (No, no, no)
I don't wanna be
(No, no, no)
I don't wanna be sad, sad, sad no more6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We're doing it

I look around me
But all I seem to see
Is people going nowhere
Expecting sympathy
It's like we're going through the motions
Of a scripted destiny
Tell me where's our inspiration
If life won't wait
I guess it's up to me

Whoa
No, we're not gonna waste another moment in this town
Whoa
And we won't come back, the world is calling out
Whoa
We'll leave the past in the past
Gonna find the future
If misery loves company
Well, so long, you'll miss me when I'm gone

Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh
Procrastination, running circles in my head
While you sit there contemplating
You wound up left for dead (Left for dead)
Life is what happens while you're busy making your excuses
Another day, another casualty
And that won't happen to me

Whoa
No, we're not gonna waste another moment in this town
Whoa
And we won't come back, the world is calling out
Whoa
We'll leave the past in the past
Gonna find the future
If misery loves company
Well, so long, you'll miss me when I'm gone

Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
When I'm gone
Let's go!
Won't look back
When I say goodbye
I'm gonna leave this hole behind me
Gonna take what's mine tonight
'Cause every wasted day becomes a wasted chance
You're gonna wake up feeling sorry
'Cause life won't wait
I guess it's up to you

Whoa
No, we're not gonna waste another moment in this town
Whoa
And we won't come back, the world is calling out
Whoa
We'll leave the past in the past
Gonna find the future
If misery loves company
Well, so long, you'll miss me when I'm gone

Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, oh, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Take a breath
I pull myself together
Just another step
Until I reach the door
You'll never know the way it tears me up inside to see you

(Oh, oh) I wish that I could tell you something
(Oh, oh) To take it all away

Sometimes I wish I could save you
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up till it's over
If it takes you forever, I want you to know

When I hear your voice
It's drowning in a whisper
It's just skin and bones
There's nothing left to take
And no matter what I do, I can't make you feel better

(Oh, oh) If only I could find the answer
(Oh, oh) To help me understand
Sometimes I wish I could save you
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up till it's over
If it takes you forever, I want you to know

That if you fall, stumble down
I'll pick you up off the ground
If you lose faith in you
I'll give you strength to pull through
Tell me you won't give up 'cause I'll be waiting if you fall
You know, I'll be there for you


(Oh, oh) If only I could find the answer
(Oh, oh) To take it all away

Sometimes I wish I could save you
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up till it's over
If it takes you forever I want you to know
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wish I could save you
I want you to know
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wish I could save you4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There you go
You're always so right
It's all a big show
It's all about you
You think you know
What everyone needs
You always take time
To criticize me

It seems like every day
I make mistakes
I just can't get it right
It's like I'm the one
You love to hate
But not today

So shut up, shut up, shut up
Don't wanna hear it
Get out, get out, get out
Get out of my way
Step up, step up, step up
You'll never stop me
Nothing you say today
Is gonna bring me down
There you go
You never ask why
It's all a big lie
Whatever you do
You think you're special
But I know, and I know, and I know, and we know
That you're not

You're always there to point
Out my mistakes
And shove them in my face
It's like I'm the one
You love to hate
But not today

So shut up, shut up, shut up
Don't wanna hear it
Get out, get out, get out
Get out of my way
Step up, step up, step up
You'll never stop me
Nothing you say today
Is gonna bring me down
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Is gonna bring me down
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Will never bring me down
Don't tell me who I should be (Don't tell me who I should be)
And don't try to tell me what's right for me
Don't tell me what I should do
I don't wanna waste my time
I'll watch you fade away

So shut up, shut up, shut up
Don't wanna hear it
Get out, get out, get out
Get out of my way
Step up, step up, step up
You'll never stop me
Nothing you say today
Is gonna bring me down
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Don't wanna hear it
Get out, get out, get out
Get out of my way
Step up, step up, step up
You'll never stop me
Nothing you say is gonna bring me down

Bring me down (Shut up, shut up, shut up)
Won't bring me down
Bring me down (Shut up, shut up, shut up)
Won't bring me
Shut up, shut up, shut up4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
