In my eyes, indisposed
In disguises no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake
In the sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat, summer stench
'Neath the black the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again

Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come? Won't you come?

Stuttering, cold and damp
Steal the warm wind, tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
Sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, a walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep
Heaven send Hell away
No one sings like you anymore
Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?
Black hole sun,  won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, black hole sun

Hang my head, drown my fear
'Til you all just disappear

Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?
Black hole sun, won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun, won't you come?

Whatsoever I feared has come to light
And whatsoever I've fought off became my life
Just when every day seemed to greet me with a smile
Sunspots have faded, now I'm doin' time, now I'm doin' time

'Cause I fell on black days
I fell on black days

Whomsoever I've cured, I've sickened now
And whomsoever I've cradled, I've put you down
I'm a searchlight soul, they say, but I can't see it in the night
I'm only faking, when I get it right, when I get it right

'Cause I fell on black days
I fell on black days

How would I know that this could be my fate?
How would I know that this could be my fate?

So what you wanted to see good has made you blind
And what you wanted to be yours has made it mine
So don't you lock up somethin' that you wanted to see fly
Hands are for shaking, no, not tying, no, not tying
I sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change
Sure don't mind, sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change

'Cause I fell on black days
I fell on black days

How would I know that this could be my fate?
How would I know that this could be my fate?

I woke the same as any other day
Except a voice was in my head
It said, "Seize the day, pull the trigger
Drop the blade and watch the rolling heads"

The day I tried to live
I stole a thousand beggars' change
And gave it to the rich
The day I tried to win
I dangled from the power lines
And let the martyrs stretch

Singing, one more time around might do it
One more time around might make it
One more time around might do it
One more time around I might make it
The day I tried to live, yeah

Words you say
Never seem to live up to the ones inside your head
The lives we make
Never seem to ever get us anywhere but dead
The day I tried to live
I wallowed in the blood and mud
With all the other pigs

Singing, one more time around might do it
One more time around might make it

Shower in the dark day, clean sparks diving down
Cool in the waterway where the baptized drown
Naked in the cold sun,  breathing life like fire
Thought I was the only one but that was just a lie

'Cause I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
I thought it was the 4th of July

Pale in the flare light, the scared light cracks and disappears
And leads the scorched ones here
And everywhere no one cares, the fire is spreading
And no one wants to speak about it

Down in the hole
Jesus tries to crack a smile
Beneath another shovel load

And I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
I thought it was the end
I thought it was the 4th of July
I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
I thought it was the 4th of July

July
Yeah, oh

Now I'm in control, now I'm in the fall out
Once asleep but now I stand
And I still remember your sweet everything
Light a Roman candle and hold it in your hand

'Cause I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
I thought it was the 4th of July

Follow me into the desert
As thirsty as you are
Crack a smile and cut your mouth
And drown in alcohol
'Cause down below the truth is lying
Beneath the riverbed
So quench yourself and drink the water
That flows below her head

Oh no, there she goes
Out in the sunshine
The sun is mine
The sun is mine

I shot my love today, would you cry for me?
I lost my head again, would you lie for me?

Close your eyes and bow your head
I need a little sympathy
'Cause fear is strong and love's for everyone
Who isn't me
So kill your health and kill yourself
And kill everything you love
And if you live you can fall to pieces
And suffer with my ghost
I shot my love today, would you cry for me?
I lost my head again, would you lie for me?
I left her in the sand just a burden in my hand
I lost my head again, would you cry for me?

It's just a burden in my hand
It's just an anchor on my heart
It's just a tumor in my head
And I'm in the dark

So follow me into the desert
As desperate as you are
Where the moon is glued to a picture of heaven
And all the little pigs have God

Oh no, there she goes
Out in the sunshine
The sun is mine
The sun is mine

I shot my love today, would you cry for me, yeah?

Nothing seems to kill me no matter how hard I try
Nothing is closing my eyes
Nothing can beat me down for your pain or delight
No

And nothing seems to break me
No matter how far I fall
Nothing can break me at all
Not one for giving up though not invincible
I know

I've given everything I need
I'd give you everything I own
I'd give in if it could at least be ours alone
I've given everything I could
To blow it to hell and gone
Burrow down in and
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside world

Someone tried to tell me something
"Don't let the world bring you down"
Nothing can do me in before I do myself
So save it for your own and the ones you can help
No

Heard it from another room
Eyes were waking up just to fall asleep
Love's like suicide
Dazed out in a garden bed
With a broken neck lays my broken gift
Just like suicide
And my last ditch
Was my last brick
Lent to finish her
Finish her
She lived like a martyr
How she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a martyr
But she dies
Just like suicide
Bit down on the bullet now
I had a taste so sour
I had to think of something sweet
Love's like suicide
Safe outside my gilded cage
With an ounce of pain
I wield a ton of rage
Just like suicide
With eyes of blood
And bitter blue
How I feel for you
I feel for you
She lived like a martyr
How she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a martyr
But she died
Just like suicide
Hey yeah
Ohh
And my last ditch
Was my last brick
Yeah, lent to finish her
Finish her
With eyes of blood

I caught the moon today
Pick it up
And throw it away all right
I got the perfect steal
A cleaner love
With a dirty feel all right
Fallout and take the bait
Eat the fruit
And kiss the snake goodnight

Common ruse, dirty face
Pretty noose is pretty hate
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from

Let your motor race
Pick it up
And get this mother gone
Out from and far away

This thing has got me on
Diamond rope, silver chain
Pretty noose is pretty pain

With my good eye closed

Stop, you're trying to bruise my mind
I can do it on my own
Stop, you're trying to kill my time
It's been my death since I was born
I don't remember half the time if I'm hiding or I'm lost
But I'm on my way, on my way

Is it to the sky?
Is it to the sky?
Is it to the sky?
Is it to the sky?
Is it to the sky?
(I'm on my way) To the sky
(I'm on my way) To the sky
(I'm on my way) To the sky
(I'm on my way) To the sky
I'm on my way (To the sky)
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
To the sky
To the sky
On my way
On my way
Is it to the sky?
To the sky
Is it to the sky?
Is it to the sky?
To the sky1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
