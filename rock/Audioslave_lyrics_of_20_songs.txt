On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone

And on I read until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death, I will wander on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone72EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Pearls and swine
Bereft of me
Long and weary
My road has been
I was lost in the cities
Alone in the hills
No sorrow or pity
For leaving, I feel, yeah

I am not your rolling wheels
I am the highway
I am not your carpet ride
I am the sky

Friends and liars
Don't wait for me
Cause I'll get on
All by myself
I put millions of miles
Under my heels
And still too close
To you, I feel, yeah
I am not your rolling wheels
I am the highway
I am not your carpet ride
I am the sky
I am not your blowing wind
I am the lightning
I am not your autumn moon
I am the night, the night

And with the early dawn moving right along
I couldn't buy an eyeful of sleep
And in the aching night under satellites
I was not received
Built with stolen parts, a telephone in my heart
Someone get me a priest
To put my mind to bed, this ringing in my head
Is this a cure or is this a disease?

Nail in my head from my creator
You gave me life, now show me how to live
Nail in my head from my creator
You gave me life, now show me how to live

And in the after birth on the quiet earth
Let the stains remind you
You thought you made a man, you better think again
Before my role defines you

Nail in my head from my creator
You gave me life, now show me how to live
Nail in my head from my creator
You gave me life, now show me how to live

And in your waiting hands, I will land
And roll out of my skin
And in your final hours, I will stand
Ready to begin

Someone falls to pieces, sleeping all alone
Someone kills the pain, spinning in the silence
She finally drifts away
Someone gets excited in a chapel yard, catches a bouquet
Another lays a dozen white roses on a grave

Yeah, and to be yourself is all that you can do
Hey, to be yourself is all that you can do

Someone finds salvation in everyone, another only pain
Someone tries to hide himself, down inside himself he prays
Someone swears his true love until the end of time, another runs away
Separate or united, healthy or insane

To be yourself is all that you can do (All that you can do), oh
To be yourself is all that you can do  (All that you can do), oh
To be yourself is all that you can do  (All that you can do), oh

And even when you've paid enough
Been pulled apart or been held up
Every single memory of the good or bad
Faces of luck, don't lose any sleep tonight
I'm sure everything will end up alright
You may win or lose

I walk the streets of Japan 'til I get lost
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
With a graveyard tan carrying a cross
Yeah, it doesn't remind me of anything
I like studying faces in parking lot
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like drivin' backwards in the fog
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything

The things that I've loved, things that I've lost
Things I've held sacred that I've dropped
I won't lie no more you can bet
I don't wanna learn what I'll need to forget

I like gypsy moths and radio talk
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like gospel music and canned applause
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like colorful clothing in the sun
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like hammering nails and speaking in tongues
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
The things that I've loved, things that I've lost
Things I've held sacred that I've dropped
I won't lie no more you can bet
Don't wanna learn what I'll need...

Bend and shape me, I love the way you are
Slow and sweetly like never before
Calm and sleeping, we won't stir up the past
So discreetly we won't look back


The things that I've loved, things that I've lost
Things I've held sacred that I've dropped
I won't lie no more you can bet
I don't wanna learn what I'll need

I like throwing my voice and breaking guitars
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like playin' in the sand, what's mine is ours
If it doesn't remind me of anything6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Once upon a time
I was of the mind
To lay your burden down
And leave you where you stood
You believed I could
You'd seen it done before
I could read your thoughts
And tell you what you saw
And never say a word
But now all that is gone
Over with and done
Never to return

And I can tell you why
People die alone
I can tell you I'm
A shadow on the sun

Staring at the loss
Looking for the cause
And never really sure
Nothing but a hole
To live without a soul
And nothing to be learned
And I can tell you why
People go insane
I can show you how
You could do the same
I can tell you why
The end will never come
I can tell you I'm
A shadow on the sun


Shapes of every size
Move behind my eyes
Doors inside my head
Bolted from within
Every drop of flame
Lights a candle in
Memory of the one
Who lived inside my skin

And I can tell you why
People go insane
I can show you how
You could do the same
I can tell you why
The end will never come
I can tell you I'm
The shadow on the sun
Shadow on the sun
Shadow on the sun
Shadow on the sun

The first time I saw you
You were chasing down
A cyclone
All alone in a field
With rail yards and clovers
I kept rolling on and never thought
You'd wind up chasing me

Settle down, I won't hesitate
To hit the highway
Before you lay me to waste
Saddle up and I'll help you find
Something to drive
Before you drive me insane

You're tired of walking and you
Loathe the ground
The sidewalk will barely touch your feet
And life moves too slowly to hold you down
With wringing hands
You take it out on me

Settle down, I won't hesitate
To hit the highway
Before you lay me to waste
Saddle up and I'll help you find
Something to drive
Before you drive me insane
So get yourself a car
And drive it all alone
Get yourself a car
And ride it on the wind

Get yourself a car
And drive it all alone
Get yourself a car
And ride it on the wind

Settle down, I won't hesitate
To hit the highway

And when you wanted me, I came to you
And when you wanted someone else, I withdrew
And when you asked for light, I set myself on fire
And if I go far away, I know
You'll find another slave

Now I'm free from what you want
Now I'm free from what you need
Now I'm free from what you are

And when you wanted blood, I cut my veins
And when you wanted love, I bled myself again
Now that I've had my fill of you, I'll give you up forever
And here I go, far away, I know you
You'll find another slave

Now I'm free from what you want
Now I'm free from what you need

House is haunted
I just want to go for a ride
Out and on
Before I set this room alight
Left alone
Forever, and for crimes unclear
With my patience gone
Someone take me far from here

Yeah, burning that gasoline
Yeah, burning that gasoline

New day yawning
Another day of solitaire
House is honest
Clearly more than I can bear
Drag me off
Before I set my world on fire
Out and gone
The sun will never set tonight

Yeah, burning that gasoline
Yeah, burning that gasoline
No "What fors"
Only a can of red
It says danger on it
I have found another way

Burning that gasoline
Yeah, burning that gasoline

I met a man locked away for things he hadn't done
Innocence on ball and chain
He'll never feel the sun
Again on his face, or roses in his hands
But when he smiled at me, I could understand

If you're free you'll never see the walls
If your head is clear you'll never free fall
If you're right you'll never fear the wrong
If your head is high you'll never fear at all

There was a daughter of a man who took his life too young
She swore she'd never do the same then did just what he'd done
And a boy who's gone insane, heard voices in his head
No one knows what they say, now his mother's dead

If you're free you'll never see the walls
If your head is clear you'll never free fall
If you're right you'll never fear the wrong
If your head is high you'll never fear at all

There was a man who had a face that looked a lot like me
I saw him in the mirror and I fought him in the street
Then when he turned away, I shot him in the head
Then I came to realize, I had killed myself
If you're free you'll never see the walls
If your head is clear you'll never free fall
If you're right you'll never fear the wrong
If your head is high you'll never fear4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Roll me on your frozen fields
Break my bones to watch them heal
Drowned me in your thirsty veins
Where I'll watch and I'll wait
And pray for the rain
Curl like smoke and breathe again
Down your throat, inside your ribs
Through your spine, and every nerve
Where I watch and I wait
And yield to the hurt

And if you don't believe the sun will rise
Stand alone and greet the coming night
In the last remaining light

The seven moons and the seven suns
Heaven waits for those who run
Down your winter and underneath your waves
Where you watch and you wait
And pray for the day

And if you don't believe the sun will rise
Stand alone and greet the coming night
In the last remaining light
And if you don't believe the sun will rise
Stand alone and greet the coming night
In the last remaining light

He was standing at the rock, gathering the flock
And getting there with no directions
And underneath the arch it turned into a march
And there he found the spark to set this fucker off

Set it off, set it off now children, set it right
Set it off, set it off now children, alright
Set it off, set it off now children, set a fire
Set it off, set it off now children

Suddenly a shot ripped into his heart
And he lay in need of some attention
And there he played his card, going into shock
The last thing that he said was, set this fucker off

Set it off, set it off now children, set it right
Set it off, set it off now children, alright
Set it off, set it off now children, set a fire
Set it off, set it off now children

Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
Jesus at the back door, everything is all right
All we need is some direction
Every time the wind blows
Everything you don't know turns into a revelation
And it all adds up inside your head
Time is wasting

Since you know everything, just clue me in

In my hour of need
On a sea of grey
On my knees I pray to you
Help me find the dawn
Of the dying day

Won't you light my way
Won't you light my way
Won't you light my way
Won't you light my way

A bullet is a man
From time to time he strays
I compare my life to this
To this I relate
And I'm willing
To listen to your answers
And I'm not afraid
To tell you I need you today

Won't you light my way
Won't you light my way
Won't you light my way
Won't you light my way
So when I'm lost
Or I'm tired and depraved
Or when my high bullet mind
Goes astray
Won't you light my way

Don't save it for another day

Whisper your songs, birds to the air

When I first came to this island
That I called by my own name
I was happy in this fortress
In my exile I remained
But the hours grew so empty
And the ocean sent her waves
In the figure of a woman
She pulled me out to sea

When you come down to take me home
Send my soul away
When you come 'round you'll make me whole
Send my soul away

On the altar of a sunrise
Was a wedding in the waves
And inside her shone a young light
From her labor I was saved
Though I've traveled long in darkness
In her harvest I'm embraced

When you come down to take me home
Send my soul away
When you come 'round you'll make me whole
Send my soul away
Now the spires and the gables
Grow in orchards to the sky
And the blessings on my table
Multiply and divide

When you come down to take me home
Send my soul away
When you come 'round you'll make me whole
Send my soul away

Yeah, when you come down to take me home
When you come 'round you'll make me whole

1200 people dead or left to die
Follow the leaders, were it an eye for an eye
We'll all be blind, deaf or murdered, this I'm sure
In this uncertain time

So come and pull the sheet over my eyes
So I can sleep tonight despite what I've seen today
I find you guilty of the crime of sleeping at a time
When you should have been wide awake

Down on the road the world is floating by
The poor and undefended left behind
While you're somewhere trading lives for oil
As if the whole world were blind, hey

Melt in the bright light of day
