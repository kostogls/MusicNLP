You know, it's kinda hard just to get along today
Our subject isn't cool, but he fakes it anyway
He may not have a clue and he may not have style
But everything he lacks, well, he makes up in denial

So don't debate, a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field, and keep it real
For you no way, for you no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world needs wannabes, ah
Hey, hey, do that brand-new thing!
Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
Give it to me, baby!

Give it to me, baby!

And all the girlies say, I'm pretty fly for a white guy

He needs some cool tunes, not just any will suffice
But they didn't have Ice Cube, so he bought Vanilla Ice
Now cruisin' in his Pinto, he sees homies as he pass
But if he looks twice, they're gonna kick his lily ass

So don't debate, a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field, and keep it real
For you no way, for you no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world loves wannabes, ah
Hey, hey, do that brand-new thing!

Now he's gettin' a tattoo, yeah, he's gettin' ink done
He asked for a 13 but they drew a 31
Friends say, he's tryin' too hard and he's not quite hip
But in his own mind, he's the, he's the dopest trip
Give it to me, baby!

Show me how to lie, you're getting better all the time
And turning all against the one is an art that's hard to teach
Another clever word sets off an unsuspecting herd
And as you step back into line, a mob jumps to their feet

Now dance, fucker, dance man, he never had a chance
And no one even knew it was really only you
And now you steal away, take him out today
Nice work you did, you're gonna go far, kid

With a thousand lies and a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away, nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives
Slowly out of line, and drifting closer in your sight
So play it out, I'm wide-awake, it's a scene about me
There's something in your way and now someone is gonna pay
And if you can't get what you want, well, it's all because of me

Now dance, fucker, dance, man, I never had a chance
And no one even knew, it was really only you
And now you'll lead the way, show the light of day
Nice work you did, you're gonna go far, kid, trust deceived
With a thousand lies and a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away, nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives

Now dance, fucker, dance, he never had a chance
And no one even knew, it was really only you
So dance, fucker, dance, I never had a chance
It was really only you

With a thousand lies and a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away, nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives

Clever alibis, Lord of the Flies
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away, nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives64EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over, I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert
Now I know I'm being used
That's okay, man, 'cause I like the abuse
I know she's playing with me
That's okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem

Oh hey yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

We make plans to go out at night
I wait 'til two, then I turn out the light
This rejection's got me so low
If she keeps it up, I just might tell her so
Oh hey yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care
Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah

Now I'll relate this little bit
It happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night, she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score
Now I know I should say no
But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem
Oh hey yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me

When we were young the future was so bright (Woah)
The old neighborhood was so alive (Woah)
And every kid on the whole damn street (Woah)
Was gonna make it big and not be beat
Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn (Woah)
The kids are grown up but their lives are worn (Woah)
How can one little street
Swallow so many lives?

Chances thrown, nothing's free
Longing for what used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
(Go!)

Jamie had a chance, well she really did (Woah)
Instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids (Woah)
Mark still lives at home 'cause he's got no job (Woah)
He just plays guitar and smokes a lot of pot
Jay committed suicide (Woah)
Brandon OD'd and died (Woah)
What the hell is going on?
The cruelest dream, reality
Chances thrown, nothing's free
Longing for what used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams

Chances thrown, nothing's free

You gotta keep 'em separated

Like the latest fashion
Like a spreading disease
The kids are strappin' on their way to the classroom
Gettin' weapons with the greatest of ease
The gangs stake out their own campus locale
And if they catch you slippin', then it's all over, pal
If one guy's colors and the other's don't mix
They're gonna bash it up, bash it up, bash it up, bash it up...

Hey! Man, you talkin' back to me?
Take him out
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey! Man, you disrespectin' me?
Take him out
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey, they don't pay no mind
If you're under 18, you won't be doing any time
Hey! Come out and play

By the time you hear the siren
It's already too late
One goes to the morgue and the other to jail
One guy's wasted and the other's a waste
It goes down the same as the thousand before
No one's getting smarter
No one's learning the score
Your never-ending spree of death and violence and hate
Is gonna tie your own rope, tie your own rope, tie your own...
Hey! Man, you disrespectin' me?

My friend's got a girlfriend, man he hates that bitch
He tells me every day

In the worst kinda way."

She sits on her ass, he works his hands to the bone
To give her money every payday
But she wants more dinero just to stay at home
Well, my friend, you gotta say

"I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?"
Say, "No way," say, "No way-ya, no way

To keep her bill collectors at bay

The gun in my hand will tell you the same
But when I'm in my car, don't give me no crap
â€™Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap

When I go driving, I stay in my lane
But getting cut off, it makes me insane

I know your arms are open wide
But you're a little on the straight side, I can't lie

Your one vice
Is you're too nice
Come around now, can't you see?

I want you, all tattooed
I want you bad
Complete me, mistreat me
I want you to be bad, bad, bad, bad, bad

If you could only read my mind
You would know that I've been waiting so long
For someone almost just like you
But with attitude, I'm waiting, so come on

Get out of clothes time
Grow out those highlights

Complicated, x-rated

Getting edgy all the time
Someone around me just a step behind
It's kind of scary, the shape I'm in
Walls are shaking and they're closing in
Too fast or a bit too slow
Paranoid of people and it's starting to show
One guy that I can't shake
Over my shoulder is a big mistake

Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kind of weak
Saying all I know is
I gotta get away from me

I tell you, something just ain't right
My head is on loose but my shoes are tight
Avoiding my friends â€™cause they all bug
Life is like a riddle and I'm really stumped
If you reason, don't you know
Your own preoccupation is where you'll go
Being followed, I look around
It's only my shadow creeping on the ground
Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kind of weak
Saying all I know is
I gotta get away from me

Now she talks about her ex nonstop, but I don't mind
But when she calls out his name in bed, that's where I draw the line
You told me a hundred times how your father left and he's gone
But I wish you wouldn't call me 'daddy' when we're gettin' it on

And I say yeah, yeah
Oh man, she's got issues and I'm going to pay
Yeah, yeah
She thinks she's the victim and she takes it all out on me
Yeah, yeah
My God, she's got issues and I'm going to pay
Going to pay 

If you think I'm controlling
Then why do you follow me around
If you're not co-dependent
Then why do you let others drag you down

I don't know why you're messed up
I don't know why your whole life is a chore
Just do me a favor
And check your baggage at the door3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Head over heels, I've fit in before
Now, I don't wanna do it no more
I held it all in with blood on my face
Built it up, man, so bad, you can taste
I don't slag no one, I don't even judge
Don't give me shit â€™cause I'm not gonna budge
I just wanna be who I wanna be
Guess that's hard for others to see

I'm not a trendy asshole
Do what I want, do what I feel like
I'm not a trendy asshole
Don't give a fuck if it's good enough for you
â€™Cause I am alive

Smash is the way you feel all alone
Like an outcast, you're out on your own
Smash is the way you deal with your life
Like an outcast, you're smashing your strife
Head over heels, I've fit in before
Now, I don't wanna do it no more
I just wanna be who I wanna be
Guess that's hard for others to see
I'm not a trendy asshole
Do what I want, do what I feel like
I'm not a trendy asshole
Don't give a fuck if it's good enough for you
â€™Cause I am alive

There. I hope you enjoyed our time together today. You know, it seems harder and harder to just sit back and enjoy the finer things in life
Well, till next time... ta-ta!

There's a moment in time, and it's stuck in my mind
Way back, when we were just kids
â€™Cause your eyes told the tale of an act of betrayal
I knew that somebody did

Oh, waves of time
Seem to wash away the scenes of our crimes
For you, this never ends

Can you stay strong? Can you go on?
Kristy, are you doing okay?
A rose that won't bloom, winter's kept you
Don't waste your whole life trying
To get back what was taken away

Though the marks on your dress had been neatly repressed
I knew that something was wrong
And I should've spoke out, and I'm so sorry now
I didn't know, â€™cause we were so young

Oh, clouds of time
Seem to rain on innocence left behind
It never goes away
Can you stay strong? Can you go on?
Kristy, are you doing okay?
A rose that won't bloom, winter's kept you
Don't waste your whole life trying
To get back what was taken away

Oh, clouds of time
Seem to rain on innocence left behind
It never goes away
It never goes away

Can you stay strong? Can you go on?
Kristy, are you doing okay?
A rose that won't bloom, winter's kept you
Don't waste your whole life trying
To get back what was taken away
Don't waste your whole life trying
To get back what was taken away2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Ow

I am the one, camouflage and guns
Risk my life to keep my people from harm
Authority vested in me
I sacrifice with my brothers in arms

Through this doorway, what's on the other side?
Never knowin' exactly what I'll find
Locked and loaded, voices screaming "Let's go!"
Come on, do it, here we go!

(Oh) I'll take a life that others may live
Oh, that's just the way it goes
(Oh) I'll shut my eyes, it hammers in my head
Where it'll end, nobody knows
(Oh) I'll take a life ten others may live
Oh, that's just the way it goes
(Oh) It's playing over and over in my head
Where it'll end, nobody knows

Stay the course, reasonable force
I believe I serve a greater good
Smoke and dust, enemies are crushed
Nothing left where a man once stood
Through this doorway, what's on the other side?
Never knowin' exactly what I'll find
Locked and loaded, voices screaming "Let's go!"
But, I'm just doing what I'm told

(Oh) I'll take a life that others may live
Oh, that's just the way it goes
(Oh) I'll shut my eyes, it hammers in my head
Where it'll end, nobody knows
(Oh) I'll take a life ten others may live
Oh, that's just the way it goes
(Oh) It's playing over and over in my head
Where it begins and where it'll end, nobody knows


Hey, go!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Bang, bang, it hammers in my head
Bang, bang, it hammers in my head
Bang, bang, it hammers in my head
In my head, in my head
Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I fear no evil for thou art with me
Locked and loaded, gonna find my truth
Now, I'm busting through, all hell breaks loose, and-a
(Woo-hoo!) And, you can all hide behind your desks now
(Woo-hoo!) And, you can cry, "Teacher, come help me!"
(Woo-hoo!) Through you all, my aim is true
My

(Woo-hoo!)
(Woo-hoo!) My aim is true
(Woo-hoo!)
My aim is true2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
