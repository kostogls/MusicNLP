Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss; how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss; it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed, and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now, he takes off her
Dress now, let me go
And I just can't look; it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

I did my best to notice
When the call came down the line
Up to the platform of surrender
I was brought, but I was kind
And sometimes I get nervous
When I see an open door
Close your eyes, clear your heart

Cut the cord

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could
And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye, wish me well
You've got to let me go

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human
Or are we dancer?

Will your system be alright
When you dream of home tonight?
There is no message we're receiving
Let me know, is your heart still beating?

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
You've got to let me know

Are we human
Or are we dancer?
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer

Breaking my back just to know your name
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game
I'm breaking my back just to know your name
But heaven ain't close in a place like this
Anything goes but don't blink, you might miss

'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said, oh, heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight (Ooh-ooh)
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential

Ready? Let's roll onto something new
Taking its toll then I'm leaving without you

'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this

Pace yourself for me
I said maybe, baby, please
But I just don't know now (Maybe, baby)

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentlemen
Like you imagined
When you were young

Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now, watch it go

We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young
When you were young
And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young

They say the devil's water — it ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentlemen
Like you imagined

On the corner of Main Street
Just tryna keep it in line
You say you wanna move on and
You say I'm falling behind
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?

I never really gave up on
Breaking out of this two-star town
I got the green light, I got a little fight
I'm gonna turn this thing around
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)

The good old days, the honest man
The restless heart, the Promised Land
A subtle kiss that no one sees
A broken wrist and a big trapeze
Oh, well, I don't mind if you don't mind
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Before you go, can you read my mind?

It’s funny how you just break down
Waiting on some sign
I pull up to the front of your driveway
With magic soaking my spine
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)
Can you read my mind? (Oooh)
The teenage queen, the loaded gun
The drop dead dream, the Chosen One
A southern drawl, a world unseen
A city wall and a trampoline
Oh, well, I don't mind, if you don't mind
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Before you jump, tell me what you find
When you read my mind

Slipping in my faith until I fall
He never returned that call
Woman, open the door, don't let it sting
I wanna breathe that fire again
She said, "I don't mind, if you don't mind (I don't mind, if you don't mind)
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine" (I don't shine if you don't shine)
Put your back on me, put your back on me (I don't mind, if you don't mind)
Oh, put your back on me
Oooh

The stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sun
Can you read my mind? (Oooh oooh)27EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

What have you gathered to report to your progenitors?
Are your excuses any better than your senator's?
He held a conference and his wife was standing by his side
He did her dirty but no-one died

I saw Sonny Liston on the street last night
Black-fisted and strong singing Redemption Song
He motioned me to the sky
I heard heaven and thunder cry

Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
You know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover

What are you waiting for, a kiss or an apology?
You think by now you'd have an A in toxicology
It's hard to pack the car when all you do is shame us
It's even harder when the dirtbag's famous
I saw my mother on the street last night
All pretty and strong, singing 'the road is long'
I said 'Momma I know you've tried'
But she fell on her knees and cried

Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
I know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover

And there was nothing she wouldn't give
Just to trust him with her nightmares, with her dreams
She's running, she's running
Just to trust him
He got a big smile, he's fake news
Just run for cover, you've got nothing left to lose

Run for cover
Run while you can, baby, don't look back
You gotta run for cover
Don't be afraid of the fear, that's a played out trap, man
You know you're not the only one
And don't look back, just run for cover

We took a walk that night, but it wasn't the same
We had a fight on the promenade out in the rain
She said she loved me, but she had somewhere to go
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I'd never let her go

Tell me what you wanna know
Oh, come on, oh, come on, oh, come on
There ain't no motive for this crime
Jenny was a friend of mine
So come on, oh, come on, oh, come on, oh

I know my rights, I've been here all day and it's time
For me to go, so let me know if it's alright
I just can't take this, I swear I told you the truth
She couldn't scream while I held her close
I swore I'd never let her go

Tell me what you wanna know
Oh, come on, oh, come on, oh, come on
And then you whisper in my ear
"I know what you're doing here"

It started with a low light
Next thing I knew, they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
It left a strange impression in my head
You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess I changed my mind

And you know, I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name
And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
That was the turning point
That was one lonely night
The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody, look down
It's all in your mind"

Well, now I'm back at home, and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
So hesitation to this life I give
You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You'd better look it over
Before you make that leap

And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night sometimes
They justify my claim
And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised
But it was the turning point
Oh, what a lonely night

The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody, look down
It's all in your mind"
The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody, look down
It's all in your mind"
My global position systems are vocally addressed
They say the Nile used to run from east to west
They say the Nile used to run
From east to west

I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes

The storm maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's gonna make you mad

We lost track of the time
Dreams aren't what they used to be
Some things slide by so carelessly

Blonde hair blowing in the summer wind
A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand
I'd been on her trail for a little while
But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand
A teenage rush
She said, "Ain't we all just runaways? We got time"

But that ain't much
We can't wait till tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose, oh!

We got engaged on a Friday night
I swore on the head of our unborn child
That I could take care of the three of us
But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild
It's in my blood
She said she might just runaway somewhere else
Someplace good

We can't wait til tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose
Let's take a chance baby, we can't lose
Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you runaway
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!

We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
Hold each other till the morning light
We used to laugh, now we only fight
Baby are you lonesome now?

At night I come home after they go to sleep
Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt these halls
There's a picture of us on our wedding day
I recognize the girl but I can't settle in these walls

We can't wait till tomorrow
Oh, we're caught up in the appeal baby, why you wanna hide it?
It's the last thing on my mind (Why you want to hide it?)
I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive

Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you run away
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Ain't we all just runaways?

Wheels are turnin'
I remember when you were mine
Just to reach you
Baby, I'd stand in line
There's another world

And there's another heart
That's fadin' in the light

Don't want your picture on my cell phone
I want you here with me
Don't want your memories in my head, no
I want you here with me

Spent the summer just layin' out in the sun
Time seems to move so slowly, when you're taking it as it comes
Maybe we were just too young
Your body was tan and your hair was long
You shot me a smile and my cares were gone
Fallin' in love filled my soul with fright
You said, "Come on, babe, it'll be alright"
I must've been a fool to the bitter end
Now I hold on to hope that I'll have you back again
I'd bargain and I'd fight
But there's another world you're livin' in tonight

Don't want your picture on my cell phone
I want you here with me
I don't want your memory in my head, no
I want you here with me

Well, I saw you in a restaurant the other day
And instead of walkin' towards you, I ran away (ran away)

You were standing with your girlfriends in the street
Falling back on forever, I wonder what you came to be
I was new in town, the boy with the eager eyes
I never was a quitter, oblivious to schoolgirl's lies
And when I look back on those neon nights
The leather seats, the passage rite
I feel the heat, I see the light

From Miss Atomic Bomb
Making out we got the radio on
You're going to miss me when I'm gone
You're going to miss me when I'm gone

Racing shadows in the moonlight
Through the desert on a hot night
For a second there we’d won
Yeah, we were innocent and young

Cast out of the night
You got a foolish heart
So you took your place but the fall from grace
Was the hardest part
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
Her soul was innocent, she kissed him and she painted it black
You should have seen your little face, burning for love
Holding on for your life
All that I wanted was a little touch
A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much, no
Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time

Miss Atomic Bomb

The dust cloud has settled, and my eyes are clear
But sometimes in dreams of impact I still hear
Miss Atomic Bomb, I'm standing here
Sweat on my skin
And this love that I've cradled
Is wearing thin (Miss Atomic Bomb)
But I'm standing here and you are too late
Your shock-wave whisper has sealed your fate
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back

Your soul was innocent
She kissed him and she painted it black (on a loser's game)

Burning for love

I tried going against my own soul's warning
But in the end, something just didn't feel right
Oh, I tried diving even though the sky was storming
I just wanted to get back to where you are

If you could see through the banner of the sun
Into eternity's eyes, like a vision reaching down to you
Would you turn away?
What if it knew you by your name?
What kind of words would cut through the clutter of the whirlwind of these days?

I tried going against my own soul's warning
And in the end, something just didn't feel right
Oh, I tried diving, even though the sky was storming
Thunderheads were forming

But then I thought I could fly
And when I hit the ground
It made a messed up sound
And it kept on rattling through my days
And cutting up my nights
Like a goddamn knife
And it got me thinking, no matter how far

And cutting up my nights

A Dustland fairytale beginning with just another white trash county kiss
In '61, long brown hair and foolish eyes
He looked just like you'd want him to, some kind of slick chrome American prince
A blue jean serenade

Moon River what'd you do to me?
I don't believe you

Saw Cinderella in a party dress but
She was lookin' for a night gown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's gettin' ready for the showdown
I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a pawn tonight

A change came in disguise of revelation, set his soul on fire
She said she'd always knew he'd come around
And the decades disappear like sinkin' ships, but we persevere
God gives us hope, but we still fear what we don't know, the mind is poison

Castles in the sky sit stranded vandalized
We're drawbridges closin'
Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's gettin' ready for the showdown
I saw the ending when they turned the page
I threw my money and I ran away
Straight to the valley of the great divide
Out where the dreams all hide

Out where the wind don't blow
Out here the good girls die
And the sky won't snow
Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the good girls die

Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep
It's such a bitter form of refuge
Oh, don't you know the kingdom's under siege
And everybody needs you
Is there still magic in the midnight sun
Or did you leave it back in sixty-one
In the cadence of a young man's eyes
Out where the dreams all hide7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw this, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and senators? But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick

They buried my sister but daddy he stayed the same

Follow the sun out of the night
Brother, just lean into the light
You wanna be sure, I’ll give you sight
Brother, just lean into the light

His hands still shake when the ponies break out on the track
(Here comes the calling)
His feet still quick when they say they want their money back (Here comes the calling)
But Daddy did you think that you could outrun the Holy Ghost? (Here comes the calling)
Lie, cheat, steal, hope they fix it all up in post

The book will be open
In front of the judge
Unquenchable fire
Or keys to the kingdom
Follow the sun out of the night
Brother, just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
You wanna be sure, I’ll give you sight
Brother, just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
The road to the kingdom's burnin' bright
Brother, just lean into the light

You heard that the master was traveling through
But what would you do if he walked in the room?
Make for the left, or break for the right?
Brother, just lean in
Brother, just lean into the light

Follow the sun out of the night
Brother, just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
You wanna be sure, I’ll give you sight
Brother, just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
The road to the kingdom's burnin' bright
Brother, just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
Follow the sun out of the night
Brother, just lean into the light
Here comes the calling
Here comes the calling4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up

Can't keep my mind off of every little wrong
I see the mouths are open, but I can't hear the song
I've done my best to fill 'em, but the cracks are starting to spread
Hey I won't blame you baby, go on turn your head

But don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up

I can't keep pretending this next stop isn't mine
The truth is on the table, someone's gotta sign
I've done my best defending, but the punches are starting to land
I'm sliding into something you won't understand

Don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up
But don't give up on me
'Cause I'm just in a rut
I'm climbing but the walls keep stacking up

So I'm handing you a memory
I hope you understand
That steadily reminds you of who I really am
This city's always breathing, I wish that it would die
The kickbacks and the bachelors, the fever for the velvet rope
The money from my mother's men
I'm not like her, you're not like them
I'll climb and I'll climb, I'll climb and I'll climb, I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb, I'll climb and I'll climb, I'll climb and I'll climb
I'll climb and I'll climb, I'll climb and I'll climb, I'll climb and I'll climb

Don't you give up on me (don't you give up, don't you give up)
Don't you give up on me (don't you give up, don't you give up)
Don't you give up on me (don't you give up, don't you give up)
Don't you give up on me (don't you give up, don't you give up)3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

One, two

On the field I remember you were incredible
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah
On the field I remember you were incredible
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah
On the match with the boys, you think you're alone
With the pain that you drain from love
In a car with a girl, promise me she's not your world
'Cause Andy, you're a star
Get down, hey

Leave your number on the locker and I'll give you a call
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah
Leave your legacy in gold on the plaques that line the hall
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah
On the streets, such a sweet face jumping in town
In the staffroom, the verdict is in
In a car with a girl, promise me she's not your world

'Cause Andy, you're a star
In nobody's eyes but mine
Andy, you're a star
In nobody's eyes but mine
Andy, you're a star
In nobody's eyes
In nobody's eyes but mine18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
