In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Double barrel buckshot)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

The forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel, and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat, for the body, for the heat
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Get crazy with the cheese whiz)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Drive-by body pierce)

(Yo, bring it on down)
I'm a driver, I'm a winner
Things are gonna change, I can feel it

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(I can't believe you)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Come on out of your dreams
And wake up from your rêverie
Time is here, don't go to sleep
Streets are running on the brink
They say that we've got nothing
But a dollar for a life of sin
'Cause there's trouble on the way
Oh, there's trouble on the way
Oh oh, get a dog and pony for a judgment day

Here we are (oh oh oh)
Running circles, around around around around (oh oh oh)
When nothing's right, just close your eyes
Close your eyes and you're gone

Nothing gonna get me in my world
Now can these broken wings free me
About a light-year from reality
If you want to fall in a dream
You could put the weight right onto me

Running circles, around around around around
When nothing's right, just close your eyes
Close your eyes and you're gone

Can't you hear those cavalry drums
Hijacking your equilibrium?
Midnight snacks in the mausoleum
Where the pixilated doctors moan
Carnivores in the Kowloon night
Breathing freon by the candlelight
Coquettes bitch slap you so polite
Till you thank them for the tea and sympathy

I want to defy
The logic of all sex laws
Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists
I'll let you be my chaperone
At the halfway home
I'm a full-grown man
But I'm not afraid to cry

Neptune's lips taste like fermented wine
Perfumed blokes on the Ginza line
Running buck wild like a concubine
Whose mother never held her hand
Brief encounters in Mercedes Benz
Wearing hepatitis contact lens
Bed and breakfast getaway weekends
With Sports Illustrated moms

The logic of all sex laws
Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists
I'll let you be my chaperone
At the halfway home

Wanna move into a fool's gold room
With my pulse on the animal jewels
Of the rules that you choose to use to get loose
With the luminous moves
Bored of these limits, let me get, let me get it like—

So nice, so nice
Smooth like a tidal wave, take you on a getaway
My friends, your friends
Livin' every day like it's just about to end
Now we're pissin' in the wind 'cause it's so pine fresh
Right now

My demon's on the cell phone
To your demons, nothing's even right or wrong
It's irrelevant, elephant in the room goes, "Boom,"
Standing on the lawn doin' jiu jitsu
Girl in a bikini with the Lamborghini shih tzu

It's your life
You gotta try to get it right
Look around, don't forget where you came from
It's just another perfect night
We're gonna take it around the world

I'm so tired of being alone
These penitent walls are all I've known
The songbird calling
Across the water
Outside my silent asylum
Oh, don't leave me on my own
Left me standing all alone

So cut me down to size
So I can fit inside
Lies that will divide
Us both in time
See the turncoat on his knees
The vagabond that no one sees
When that moon stole your shadows
When you can't save the ones you caught in battle
Oh, don't leave me on my own
Left me standing all alone
Cut me down to size
So I can fit inside
Lies you tried to hide
Behind your eyes
Don't leave me on my own
Don't leave me on my own

So cut me down to size
So I can fit inside
Lies that will divide

When you get the rhythm and words all make you cold
When they break it down and this world is all you know
Hands up, you're working it 'round
Now get yourself together
When you call the dominoes fall, it's time to go

Now I'm feeling so far away
I see the colors and all the kids going home
Night is crawling up to the day
I hear the noise ringing
The sirens all singing

Just wanna stay up all night with you
Just wanna stay up all night with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do
Just wanna stay up all night with you

Keep on moving
Don't wait for nothing now
Keep on moving

Oh, keep on moving
Don't wait, don't wait for nothing now
Oh, keep on moving
Don't wait for nothing now, nothing now
One, two, what you doing?
I been jumping through some hoops
Wanna get my body loose
Wanna tell you, tell you what to do
I been running out of bounds like an animal struggling
Looking for a diamond
I'm trying, I'm fighting
Right into the rhythm now

I just wanna stay up all night
Wanna stay up all night with you
With you, you

Just wanna stay up all night with you (wanna stay up all night)
Just wanna stay up all night with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do (than stay up all night)
Just wanna stay up all night with you

Put it up in the air
If you don't really care
Let them know that you're there
If you got the time to take it up there
Hands up in the air
Living out on a prayer
Let them know that you're there
If you got the time to take it up there
Up all night with you
With you, with you5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I saw her, yeah I saw her with her black tongue tied
Round the roses
Fist pounding on a vending machine
Toy diamond ring stuck on her finger
With a noose she can hang from the sun
And put it out with her dark sunglasses
Walking crooked down the beach
She spits on the sand where their bones are bleaching

And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I wouldn't try

Hey, my sun-eyed girl
Hey, my sun-eyed girl
My sun-eyed girl

I saw her, yeah I saw her with her hands tied back
And her rags were burning
Crawling out from a landfilled life
Scrawling her name upon the ceiling
Throw a coin in a fountain of dust
White noise, her ears are ringing
Got a ticket for a midnight hanging
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong

Woke up this morning
From a long night in the storm
Looked up this morning
Saw the roses full of thorns
Mountains are falling
They don't have nowhere to go
The ocean's a diamond
That only shines when you're alone
But can we start it all over again?
This morning
I've lost all my defenses
This morning
Won't you show me the way
It used to be?

We've gone all around
'Til there's nothing left to say
We've worn it all down
Into something that couldn't be saved
You tore it all down
And bury me underneath the weight
But can we start it all over again?
This morning
I let down my defenses
This morning
It was just you and me
This morning
I've run all out of guesses
This morning
Won't you show me the way
It could've been?13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Straight down out of the world with my fingers
Holding onto the devil I know
All my troubles will hang on your trigger
Take your eyes and your mind from the road
Shoot your mouth if you know where you're aiming
Don't forget to pick up what you sow
Talking trash to the garbage around you

Broke down out in a ditch of old rubbish
Snakes and bones in the back of your room
Handing out a confection of venom
Heaven's drunk from the poison you use
Charm the wolves with the eyes of a gambler
Now I see it's a comfort to you
Hammer my bones on the anvil of daylight

You sang your swan song to the dogs
As they made mincemeat of the dreams you hung your hopes on
So you counted out what your sins cost
While money talks to your conscience, working like a fool for love

Dear life, I’m holding on
Dear life, I’m holding on
How long must I wait
Before the thrill is gone


You drove your Rolls into the swamp
And stole away like a thief, reeling from the sticker shock
Of the price they put upon your soul
You buy it back from the burning ashes of the devil you know

Dear life, I’m holding on
Dear life, I’m holding on
How long must I wait
Before the thrill is gone

Dear life, come and pick me up
Dear life, I think the button’s stuck
Dear life, I think it’s gone too far
Dear life, please lower the bar
Lower than the stars

Dear life, I’m holding on
Dear life, I’m holding on
How long must I wait

Free
As a driving wheel
Circling around your iron will;
See-
Only what you feel
Keeps you turning when you’re standing still

You tried to run from trouble; when it comes
You follow the drum
Keeping time with everyone

High
As the light of day
Falling down across your lost highway;
Why
Does it hurt this way?
To come so far to find they've closed the gates?

You’ve lost your tongue; when you fall from the pendulum
Your heart is a drum
Keeping time with everyone
Everyone
If they drown from the undertow
Need to find someone
To show me how to play it slow
And just let it go

Your eyes get stung by the rays of the sinking sun
You follow the drum
Keeping time with everyone

Going, “beat, beat, beat”
It’s beating me down
“Beat, beat, beat, beat”
It’s beating me down
Day after day
It’s turning me round
Till all my days are drowning out9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Put your hands on the wheel
Let the golden age begin
The window down
Feel the moonlight on your skin
The desert wind
Cool your aching head
The weight of the world
Drift away instead

Ohh, these days I barely get by
I don't even try

It's a treacherous road
With a desolated view
There's distant lights
But here they're far and few
And the sun don't shine
Even when it's day
You gotta drive all night
Just to feel like you're ok

Ohh, these days I barely get by

And everywhere I look there's a dead end waiting
Temperature's dropping at the rotten oasis
Stealing kisses from the leprous faces

Heads are hanging from the garbage man trees

Smiling eyes ripping out of his sockets
