I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with every day
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you
And the reason is you
And the reason is you
And the reason is you

I'm not a perfect person
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

I’ve found a reason to show
A side of me you didn’t know
A reason for all that I do
And the reason is you50EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I will dedicate and sacrifice my every
Thing for just a second's worth of how my story's ending
And I wish I could know if the directions that I take
And all the choices that I make won't end up all for nothing

Show me what it's for, make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer

Help me carry on, assure me it's OK to
Use my heart and not my eyes to navigate the darkness
Will the ending be ever coming suddenly?
Will I ever get to see the ending to my story?

Show me what it's for, make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer

So when and how will I know?
How much further do I have to go?
And how much longer 'til I finally know?
`Cause I'm looking and I just can't see what's in front of me
In front of me

Show me what it's for, make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what I've been handed?

I've done everything as you say
I've followed your rules without question
I thought it would help me see things clearly
But instead of helping me to see
I look around and it's like I'm blinded

I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control

Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
'Cause I don't know, if I can trust you
I don't understand what you want from me

I feel like I'm spinning out of control
Try to focus but everything's twisted
And all alone I thought you would be there
To let me know I'm not alone
But in fact that's exactly what I was

I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
'Cause I don't know, if I can trust you
Or all of the things you've said to me

I may never know the answer
To this endless mystery
Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me

Is it a mystery? Is it a mystery?
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control

Spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control, out of control
I'm spinnin' out of control

Where should I go? What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
'Cause I don't know, if I can trust you

Whenever I step outside
Somebody claims to see the light
It seems to me that all of us have lost our patience
Cause everyone thinks they're right
And nobody thinks that there just might
Be more than one road to our final destination

But I'm not ever gonna know if I'm right or wrong
Cause we're all going in the same direction
And I'm not sure which way to go
Because all along, we've been going in the same direction

I'm tired of playing games
Of looking for someone else to blame
For all the holes in answers that are clearly showing
For something to fill the space
Was all of the time I spent a waste
Cause so many choices point the same way I was going

But I'm not ever gonna know if I'm right or wrong
Cause we're all going in the same direction
And I'm not sure which way to go
Because all along, we've been going in the same direction
Going in the same direction
Same direction (same direction)
So why does there only have to be one correct philosophy?
I don't wanna go and follow you just to end up like one of them
And why are you always telling me what you want me to believe?
I'd like to think that I can
Go my own way and meet you in the end
Go my own way and meet you in the end

I'm not ever gonna know if I'm right or wrong
Cause we're all going in the same direction
And I'm not sure which way to go
Because all along, we've been going in the same direction
Going in the same direction
Going in the same direction
Same direction (same direction)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I don't want you to give it all up
And leave your own life collecting dust
And I don't want you to feel sorry for me
You never gave us a chance to be
And I don't need you to be by my side
To tell me that everything's alright
I just wanted you to tell me the truth
You know I'd do that for you

So why are you running away?
Why are you running away?

I did enough to show you that I
Was willing to give and sacrifice
And I was the one who was lifting you up
When you thought your life had, had enough
And when I get close, you turn away
There's nothing that I can do or say
So now I need you to tell me the truth
You know I'd do that for you

So why are you running away?
Why are you running away?
Is it me? (Is it me) Is it you? (Is it you)
Nothing that (Nothing that)

Is it me? Is it you?
Nothing that I can do
To make you change your mind, no

I thought it was too good to be true
I found somebody who understands me
Someone who would help me to get through
And fill an emptiness I had inside me
But you kept inside and I just denied
Some things that we should have both said
I knew it was too good to be true
Cause I'm the only one who understands me

What happened to us?
We used to be so perfect
Now we're lost and lonely
What happened to us?
And deep inside I wonder
Did I lose my only?

Remember they thought we were too young
To really know what it takes to make it
But we had survived off what we have done
So we could show them all that they're mistaken
But who could have known
The lies that would grow
Until we could see right through them
Remember they knew we were too young
We still don't know what it takes to make it
What happened to us?
We used to be so perfect
Now we're lost and lonely
What happened to us?
And deep inside I wonder
Did I lose my only one?

We could've made it work
We could've found a way
We should've done our best to see another day
But we kept it all inside until it was too late
And now we're both alone
The consequence we pay for throwing it all away
For throwing it all away

What happened to us?
We used to be so perfect
Now we're lost and lonely
What happened to us?
And deep inside I wonder
Did I lose my only?

What happened to us?
What happened to us?

You seem to find the dark when everything is bright
You look for all that's wrong instead of all that's right
Does it feel good to you to rain on my parade
You never say a word unless it's to complain
It's driving me insane
If I were you
Holding the world right in my hands
The first thing I'd do
Is thank the stars for all that I have
If I were you
Look what surrounds you now
More than you ever dreamed
Have you forgotten just how hard it used to be
So what's it going to take
For you to realize
It all could go away in one blink of an eye
It happens all the time
If I were you
Holding the world right in my hands
The first thing I'd do
Is thank the stars above
Tell the ones I love
That I do
Yea if I were you
Whoa yea if I were you
Yea if I were you
Whoa if I were you
So what's it going to take
For you to realize
It all could go away in one blink of an eye
It happens all the time
If I were you
Holding the world right in my hands

For the world I love
Take a breath and enjoy the view
Live the life that I've wanted to

There's a pain that sleeps inside
It sleeps with just one eye
And awakens the moment that you leave
Though I try to look away
The pain it still remains
Only leaving when you're next to me
Do you know, that everytime you're near
Everybody else seems far away
So can you come and make them disappear
Make them disappear and we can stay
So I stand and look around
Distracted by the sounds
Of everyone and everything I see
And I search through every face
Without a single trace, of the person
The person that I need
Do you know, that everytime you're near
Everybody else seems far away
So can you come and make them disappear
Make them disappear and we can stay
Can you make them disappear?
Make them disappear
There's a pain that sleeps inside
Sleeps with just one eye
And awakens, the moment that you leave
And I search through every face
Without a single trace, of the person
The person that I need
Do you know, that everytime you're near
Everybody else seems far away
So can you come and make them disappear

Don't ever think you're broken or not good enough
Cause all the things you wanna fix are things that I love
I'll tell you now, there's nothing for your to hide
I know who are inside, you're all that I need
Don't listen to the voices saying otherwise
Look into my eyes, listen to me

You have never been more beautiful
Than you are now and you don't even know
Don't be afraid of being vulnerable
'Cause you have never been, never been more beautiful

You don't see yourself the same anymore
And say I don't look at you like I did before
Those imperfections give you insecurities
But they fit you perfectly, don't change a thing
They make you who are and you are who I want
I'm begging from my heart, so won't you listen to me?

You have never been more beautiful
Than you are now and you don't even know
Don't be afraid of being vulnerable
'Cause you have never been more beautiful
You have never been more beautiful
Than you are now and you don't even know
Don't be afraid of being vulnerable
'Cause you have never been more beautiful
Just show me what you've covered
It'll make me only want you more
'Cause I'm aching to discover
If there's any other scars I haven't seen before
It's true I don't look at you like I did before
'Cause when I look at you now, I want you even more

You have never been more beautiful
Than you are now and you don't even know
Don't be afraid of being vulnerable
'Cause you have never been more beautiful
You have never been more beautiful
Than you are now when the real you shows
There's no shame in being vulnerable
'Cause you have never been, never been more beautiful
You have never been more beautifulEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It seems so obvious
There's something up with us
I swear I feel it
From across the room
So can I ask you this
Not to be forward miss
But I think I'll kill myself
If I never knew
What do I have to do
To get inside of you
To get inside of you
'Cause I love the way you move
When I'm inside of you
When I'm inside of you
Just ask and I will do
Anything you want me to
There is no limit
To how far I will go
And I'm sure I can't pretend
To be a gentleman
But before I began
I just gotta know
(Just gotta know)
(Just gotta know)
What do I have to do
To get inside of you
To get inside of you
'Cause I love the way you move
When I'm inside of you
When I'm inside of you
For now I'll play the game
And I'm waiting for your move
But I've got to say
That I never lose

To get inside of you

I must make a choice
A tough decision
Listen to my voice
Should I give in
To temptation admiration
One leads to myself
The other some one else
Just an empty shell
Just an empty shell
It's harder than it seems
When you're told that
All your hopes and dreams
Are yours to hold if
You just give them
What's expected
Something they can sell
Put upon a shelf
But I am not for sale
I am not for sale
I here a voice inside
It's grown into a scream
I'm not the next of them
I am the first of me
'Cause I can't live the lie
I am just what you see
I'm not the next of them
I am the first of me
If I can't refuse
The price they offer
I am sure to lose
And I will suffer
Sell my soul to make a profit
All I have to do
Is make believe it's true
That something I can't do
That something I can't do
I here a voice inside
It's grown into a scream
I'm not the next of them
I am the first of me
'Cause I can't live the lie
I am just what you see
I'm not the next of them
I am the first of me
I am the first of me
I am the first of me
So when the waiting's gone
It's time to face the truth
You know your good enough
Deep down inside of you
You're finally woken up
If only just to prove
You are born to lead the way
Then be the first of youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I wake up all alone
Somewhere unfamiliar
Been gone so many days
I'm losing count
When I think of home
I see your face
I know I have to wait
You're so close, but so far
It's tearing me apart
What I would do to be there with you
You're so close, yet so far
It's tearing me apart
What I would do, to be back with you
I miss hearing your laughter
And all the little things
Forgotten what it's like to hold you
'Cause where I am right now
So unforgiving
It's numbing everything
We're so close, yet so far
It's tearing me apart
What I would do, to be there with you
You're so close, yet so far
It's tearing me apart
What I would do, to be back with you
So promise
No matter how long it takes me to get back to you
You'll wait for me
I promise
No matter how far away I go, I'll always come back for you
Just wait and see
I miss being at home
I miss your face
Don't think I can wait
We're so close, yet so far
It's tearing me apart
What I would do, to be there with you
You're so close, yet so far
It's tearing me apart
What I would do, to be back with you

I’ve been living for too long
With a feeling something’s wrong
Like a thorn stuck in my side
Just out of reach for me to pull it out
Now the picture’s crystal clear
I can see that the end is near
We no longer to have pretend
All things have got to come to an end
This is gonna hurt
This is gonna hurt you
This is gonna hurt you
More than it hurts me
And I don’t wanna hurt
That’s why I’m gonna hurt you
That’s why I’m gonna hurt you
That’s how it’s gonna be
And they say what doesn’t kill you
Well, I’m sure you know the rest
If you’d shut up for a second
I could get this off my chest
Cause I’ve been though way too much
And we’ve grown so out if touch
Now we can’t see eye to eye
It’s time to kiss it goodbye
This is gonna hurt
This is gonna hurt you
This is gonna hurt you
More than it hurts me
And I don’t wanna hurt
That’s why I’m gonna hurt you
That’s why I’m gonna hurt you
That’s how it’s gonna be
This is gonna hurt you
That’s how it’s gonna be
This is gonna hurt you
Can’t you see the writing on the wall?
One more step before I end it all
Closing my eyes, holding my breath
Finish it now, get it over with
Can’t you see the writing on the wall?

I wonder what you'll take from me today
Sanity or just my breath away
It's hard to say
Impossible for me to tell
We're always walking on eggshells
Who you're going to be from day-to-day-to-day
I wish that we could go back to what we were before
But I don't think that I love you anymore, anymore
Wonder why it is that you don't see
How much you've changed since we first met
And how much that it's killing me
I know that I will always miss
The butterflies of our first kiss
And how you used to smile so easily
I wish that we could go back to how we were before
But I don't think that I love you anymore, anymore
It's too hard to be pretending
It's too hard to ignore
I don't think that I love you anymore, anymore
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I never thought that it would come to this
I know we'll never get back

Everybodies guilty tryna sell you a lie
Ive been buying yours and youve been buying mine
Cause up until now all we know of you or me
Is what we want the other to see

Even at my worst
It's all been well rehearsed
Doctored up, filtered out
Just the best is allowed
Make it pop a little more
Now its ready for the worl

Don't look away, don't close the page
Don't act like you don't do the same thing too
It's me, it's you but not the truth
Don't act like you don't do the same thing too
'Cause you do

If we ever meet we're both in for a surprise
The person that we see won't match the ones in our minds
Without that effect what you see's not what you get
So back behind the lens and I'll adjust on the fly
Everyone can see (We're all fake, insecure)
Everyone but me (It's attentional play)
Oh my God, even more in my own little world
See this look on my face?
This is how I woke today

Don't look away, don't close the page
Don't act like you don't do the same thing too
It's me, it's you but not the truth
Don't act like you don't do the same thing too
It's me, it's you but not the truth
How else was I going to show you?
Everything on the screen
Is just another version of the person that I want you to see
Don't act like you don't do the same thing too

When the door shuts don't worry about me
It's not attention that I want from you
I need you to trust who I'm gonna be
And in everything I'm going to do
Cuz I'm not afraid of what I don't know
For understanding is all that I earn
What is for sure is I'm going to go
I'm going to live and I'm going to learn...
And I know there will be mistakes that I will make...
But I know that none are worse than chances I don't take... take...
Chorus:
Right before your eyes I am changing... changing...
New life on the inside I am changing... changing...
When the door shuts
It shuts finally
A new person that I have become
I'll follow my heart to my destiny
The living in fear and the sorrow is done
There will be no more feeling that I'm all alone
I will surround myself with things that help me grow...
Right before your eyes I am changing... changing...
New life on the inside I am changing... changing...
Right before your eyes I am changing... changing...
New life on the inside I am changing... changing...(2x)
Right before your eyes...
Right before your eyes....EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I stand here face to face
With someone that I used to know
Who used to look at me and laugh
But now he claims
That he's known me for so very long
But I remember being no one

I wanted to be just like you
So perfect, so untouchable
Now you want me to be with you
Someone who used to have it all

Do you remember now?
You acted like you never noticed me
Forget it!
'Cause the gone has come around
You're not allowed to be a part of me

Did you know me?
Or were you too preoccupied with
Playing king in your small kingdom?
And now the real world
Has stripped you of your royalty
And from your kingdom you're evicted
I wanted to be just like you
So perfect, so untouchable
Now you want me to be with you
Someone who used to have it all

Do you remember now?
You acted like you never noticed me
Forget it!
'Cause the gone has come around
You're not allowed to be a part of me
Part of me, part of me, part of me

I ain't gonna push
Ain't gonna push no more

I ain't gonna chase you down
'Cause every time I do you get further away
I'm just gonna do my thing
Sit back and let the cards fall where they may

There is no formula to make you wanna come around
When you gonna come around?
Everyone thinks they know but no one's ever showed me how

I ain't gonna push
Ain't gonna push no more
Pull me back, pull me back
Back into you

Pull me back, pull me back
Back into you

'Cause every time I do you kick dirt in my face
I'm just gonna be myself
Relax and watch the pieces fall into place

Maybe it's time for me to do what just feel right
That's when you come to me, when I'm not even trying

I ain't gonna push
Ain't gonna push no more
Pull me back, pull me back
Back into you

Ain't gonna push no more
Pull me back, pull me back
Back into you

Instead of celebrating what is right
I ain't gonna chase you down
Every time I do you get further away

Ain't gonna push no more
Pull me back, pull me back
