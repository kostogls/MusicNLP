Once upon a time, not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love

She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in, when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay
Someday"
We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer, livin' on a prayer


Ooh, we gotta hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer43EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

This ain't a song for the broken-hearted (woah oh, woah oh, oh)
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud

It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks

It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life
Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down

It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life40EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darling, you give love a bad name

An angel's smile is what you sell
You promised me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free

Woah, you're a loaded gun, yeah
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
Yeah, you give love a bad name

Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye
Woah, you're a loaded gun
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)

It's all the same, only the names will change
Every day it seems we're wastin' away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home

I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive

Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone, well, all you do is think

I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
Wanted (Wanted) dead or alive

Oh, and I ride

Ooh, I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive

But I walk these streets, a loaded six-string on my back
I play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back
I've been everywhere, (Oh yeah) still I'm standin' tall
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all

'Cause I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse, I ride
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
And I'm a cowboy
I got the night on my side
And I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive

And I ride (And I ride), dead or alive
I still drive (Still drive), dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine
To say to you 'till the end of time
Yeah, I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I guess this time you're really leavin'
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well as my broken heart lies bleedin'
You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimmin' for the shore
You left me drownin' in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I'm prayin' to God you'll give me one more chance, girl

I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you

I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hidin' place
Well, I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday
And, baby, you know my hands are dirty
(And baby you know my hands are dirty)
But I wanted to be your valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you


And I wasn't there when you were happy
(And I wasn't there to make you happy)
I wasn't there when you were down
I didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out

I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for

Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of Vodka is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist, I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I wanna be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses

Well I'm so far away, that each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby, blind love is true
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses

Well, this hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died
Ooh yeah


Now as you close your eyes know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight, I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove for it's you that I'd die to defend
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down

On the street where you live girls talk about their social lives
They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes
(All your life) All your life all you've asked when's your daddy gonna talk to you
But you was living in another world trying to get your message through

No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway

Take a line every night guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets, calling for a wild time
So you sit home alone cause there's nothing left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you
You know she likes the lights at nights on the neon Broadway signs
She don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway

No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy’s girl learned fast
Now she works the night away
Ooh, she's a little runaway

There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack

It's hard for me to say the things
I want to say sometimes
There's no one here but you and me
And that broken old street light
Lock the doors
We'll leave the world outside
All I've got to give to you
Are these five words tonight

Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes
When I couldn't see
For parting my lips
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me 

I never knew I had a dream
Until that dream was you
When I look into your eyes
The sky's a different blue
Cross my heart
I wear no disguise
If I tried, you'd make believe
That you believed my lies

You pick me up when I fall down
You ring the bell before they count me out
If I was drowning you would part the sea
And risk your own life to rescue me

Yeah 
Lock the doors
We'll leave the world outside
All I've got to give to you
Are these five words tonight

When I couldn't fly
Oh, you gave me wings
You parted my lips
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

As I sit in this smoky room
The night about to end
I pass my time with strangers
But this bottle's my only friend
Rememberin' when we used to park
On Butler Street out in the dark
Remember when we lost the keys
And you lost more than that in my backseat, baby

Remember how we used to talk
About bustin' out, we'd break their hearts
Together forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hopin' it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we've gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

Remember days of skippin' school
Racin' cars and bein' cool
With a six-pack and the radio
We didn't need no place to go
Remember at the prom that night
You and me, we had a fight
But the band, they played our favorite song
And I held you in my arms so strong
We danced so close, we danced so slow
And I swore I'd never let you go
Together forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hopin' it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we've gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

Oh, and I guess you'd say we used to talk
About bustin' out, we'd break their hearts
Together forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye

Why, you wanna tell me how to live my life?
Who, are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man?
My daddy lived the lie, that's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slaving away

Ohh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day

Take a look around you; nothing's what it seems
We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand
Anybody brave enough to take a stand
I've knocked on every door, on every dead end street
Looking for forgiveness
What's left to believe?
Ohh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day


Ohh, ohh, if there's one thing I hang onto

Have a nice day
Have a nice day

My mama told me
When I was younger
You better speak up
Don't be a number
My daddy told me
When there was thunder
Go be the lightning
Don't run for cover

Who's gonna help the helpless
Sometimes we're all alone
These days we're all just looking
For a place that we call home

Now we can't climb over
And you can't go 'round
Build them up
We'll tear them down
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
And tear down walls
These walls
Are the mountains that we climb
These walls
Are the great divide
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
Tear down walls

The space between us
Is getting wider
We need the spark to
Light the fire
Show me the promise
Give me some feeling
There's too much hurting
We need some healing

Who's gonna help the helpless
Sometimes we're all alone
These days we're one step closer
To that place that we call home

Now we can't climb over
And you can't go 'round
Build them up
We'll tear them down

Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges

Gonna watch them fall

Tear down these walls

I remember when the world was smaller
And we both felt 10 feet taller

Now we can't climb over
And you can't go 'round
Build them up
We'll tear them down
Brick by brick
Gonna watch them fall
Build more bridges
And tear down walls

I should have seen it coming when roses died
Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
I should have listened when you said good night
You really meant good bye
Baby, ain't it funny how we never ever learn to fall?
You're really on your knees, when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are "know-it-alls" and I played that fool for you

I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby

If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song

Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
But you and I were the renegades, some things never change
It made me so mad because I wanted it bad for us baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had ain't worth saving
If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long

Shot through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call love

Would you be content to see me crying?
After all those little games you put me through
After all, I've done for you, you're lying
Wouldn't it be nice, to tell the truth?

Didn't somebody somewhere say
You're gonna take a fall?
I gave you everything
Now here's the curtain call

And I'm shot through the heart as I lay there alone
In the dark through the heart
It's all part of this game that we call love

Now you've come back here to say you're sorry, haha!
I just don't know who you're talking to
It could be the man I used to be, girl
I've grown up and now I'm over you
Standing there just a live wire
With nowhere left to turn
You were gonna set the world on fire
But you never learn
That I'm shot through the heart as I lay there alone
In the dark through the heart
It's all part of this game that we call love


Standing there just a live wire
With nowhere left to turn
You were gonna set the world on fire
But you never learn?
Now you're shot

Baby does, baby, please
And baby must have what she sees
But not this time, the tables turned
And, baby, you just got burned

Shot through the heart as I lay there alone
In the dark through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call
Shot through the heart as I lay there alone
In the dark through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call
Shot through the heart as I lay there alone
In the dark through the heart
It's all part of the game...
Shot, shot, shot
Shot, shot, shot
Shot, shot, shot1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Rainy night and we worked all day
We both got jobs because there's bills to pay
We got something they can't take away
Our love, our lives
Close the door, leave the cold outside
I don't need nothing when I'm by your side
We got something that'll never die
Our dreams, our pride

My heart beats like a drum (All night)
Flesh to flesh, one to one (And it's alright)
And I'll never let go cause
There's something I know deep inside

You were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
Light a candle, blow the world away
Table for two on a TV tray
It ain't fancy, baby, that's okay
Our time, our way
So hold me close better hang on tight
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride
We're two kids hitching down the road of life
Our world, our fight

If we stand side by side (All night)
There's a chance we'll get by (And it's alright)
And I'll know that you'll be live
In my heart till the day that I die

'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

My heart beats like a drum (All night)
Flesh to flesh, one to one (And it's alright)
And I'll never let go cause
There's something I know deep inside

You were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man
You were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

I was walking around, just a face in the crowd
Trying to keep myself out of the rain
Saw a vagabond king wear a styrofoam crown
Wondered if I might end up the same
There's a man out on the corner
Singing old songs about change
Everybody got their cross to bare these days

She came looking for some shelter
With a suitcase full of dreams
To a motel room on the boulevard
I guess she's trying to be James Dean
She's seen all the disciples
And all the wannabes
No one wants to be themselves these days
Still there's nothing to hold on to but these days

These days, the stars seem out of reach
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets
These days are fast, nothing lasts in this graceless age
There ain't nobody left but us these days

Jimmy Shoes, he busted both his legs
Trying to learn to fly
From a second story window
He just jumped and closed his eyes
His momma said he was crazy
He said, "Momma, i've got to try
Don't you know that all my heroes died?
And I guess I'd rather die than f-f-fade away", yeah
These days, the stars seem out of reach, yeah
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets, oh no no
These days are fast, nothing lasts, it's a graceless age
Even innocence has caught the midnight train
There ain't nobody left but us these days

(Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh) I know Rome's still burning
(Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh) Though the times have changed
(Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh) This world keeps turning round and round and round and round these days


These days, the stars seem out of reach, yeah
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets, oh no no
These days are fast, love don't last, it's a graceless age
Even innocence has caught the midnight train
These days, the stars seem out of reach, yeah
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets, oh no no
These days are fast, nothing lasts, there ain't no time to waste
There ain't nobody left to take the blame
Oh no no no, ain't nobody left but us these days
Ain't nobody left but us these days

I was born to be of service
Camp Lejeune just felt like home
I had honor, I found purpose
"Sir, yes, sir," that's what I know
They sent us to a place
I never heard of weeks before
When you're nineteen it ain't hard to sleep
In the desert on God's floor
Close your eyes, stop counting sheep
You ain't in boot camp anymore

We were taught to shoot our rifles
Men and women side by side
Thought we'd be met as liberators
In a thousand-year-old fight
I got this painful ringing in my ear
From an IED last night
But no lead-lined Humvee war machine
Could save my sergeant's life
Three more soldiers, six civilians
Need these words to come out right

God of mercy, God of light
Save your children from this life
Hear these words, this humble plea
For I, have seen the suffering
And with this prayer, I'm hopin'
That we can be unbroken
It's eighteen months now, I’ve been stateside
With this medal on my chest
But there are things I can't remember
And there are things I won't forget
I lie awake at night
With dreams the Devil shouldn't see
I wanna scream, but I can't breathe
And Christ, I'm sweatin' through these sheets
Where's my brothers? Where's my country?
Where's my "how things used to be"?

God of mercy, God of light
Save your children from this life
Hear these words, this humble plea
For I, have seen the suffering
And with this prayer, I'm hopin'
That we can be unbroken

My service dog's done more for me
Than the medication would
There ain't no angel that's comin' to save me
But even if they could
Today, twenty-two will die from suicide
Just like yesterday, they're gone
I live my life for each tomorrow
So their memories will live on
Once we were boys, and we were strangers
Now we're brothers and we're men
Someday, you'll ask me, "Was it worth it
To be of service in the end?"
Well, the blessing and the curses
Yeah, I'd do it all again

Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, yeah2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Tonight they're shutting down the borders
And they boarded up the schools
Small towns are rollin’ up their sidewalks
One less paycheck comin' through
I know you're feelin’ kinda nervous
We're all a little bit confused
Nothing's the same, this ain't a game
We gotta make it through

As we wave outside the window
Older loved ones stay inside
Moms and babies blowin' kisses
May be saving someone's life
They had to cancel graduation
It ain't fair to Skype the prom
Our kids sit homе in isolation
TV news is always on

When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
This ain’t my prayer, it’s just a thought I'm wanting to sеnd
’Round here, we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
The chicken farm from Arkansas bought workers PPE
Not before five hundred more had succumbed to this disease
Honest men and honest women workin' for an honest wage
I got a hundred point one fever, and we still got bills to pay

When you can’t do what you do
You do what you can
This ain't my prayer, it's just a thought I'm wanting to send
'Round here, we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can

They built a hospital on East Meadow in Central Park last night
Doctors, nurses, truckers, grocery store clerks manning the front lines
I saw a Red Cross on the Hudson
They turned off the Broadway lights
Another ambulance screams by
There by the grace of God go I

Although I'll keep my social distance
What this world needs is a hug
Until we find the vaccination
There's no substitute for love
So love yourself and love your family
Love your neighbor and your friend
Ain't it time we loved a stranger?
They're just a friend you ain't met yet
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
This ain't my prayer, it's just a thought I'm wanting to send
'Round here, we bend but don't break
Down here, we all understand
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can
When you can't do what you do
You do what you can1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
