There's no one in town I know
You gave us some place to go
I never said thank you for that
I thought I might get one more chance

What would you think of me now
So lucky so strong so proud?
I never said thank you for that
Now I'll never have a chance

May angels lead you in
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads the sleepless go

I felt for sure last night that once we said goodbye
No one else will know these lonely dreams
No one else will know that part of me
I'm still driving away and I'm sorry every day
I won't always love these selfish things
I won't always live not stopping

It was my turn to decide
I knew this was our time
No one else will have me like you do
No one else will have me, only you

You'll sit alone forever if you wait for the right time
What are you hoping for?
I'm here, I'm now, I'm ready
Holding on tight
Don't give away the end
The one thing that stays mine

Amazing still it seems
I'll be 23
I won't always love what I'll never have
I won't always live in my regrets
You'll sit alone forever if you wait for the right time

Are you going to live your life wondering
Standing in the back, looking around?
Are you going to waste your time thinking
How you've grown up or how you missed out?
Th-th-th-th-things are never going to be the way you want
Where's it going to get you acting serious?
Th-th-th-th-things are never going to be quite what you want
Even at 25, you got to start sometime

I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go
Now all I need is just to hear a song I know
I want to always feel like part of this was mine
I want to fall in love tonight

Are you going to live your life standing in the back looking around?
Are you going to waste your time?
Got to make a move or you'll miss out
So-so-so-so-someone's going to ask you what it's all about
Stick around, nostalgia won't let you down
So-so-so-so-someone's going to ask you what it's all about
What you going to have to say for yourself?

I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go

I want to always feel like part of this was mine
I want to fall in love tonight
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over

Our house in the middle of the street
(And clover)
Why did we ever meet?
(Over)
Started my rock 'n roll fantasy

I don't feel the way I've ever felt
I know
Gonna smile and not get worried
I try but it shows

Anyone can make what I have built and better now
Anyone can find the same white pills
It takes my pain away

It's a lie, a kiss with open eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me
(It takes my pain away)
Never mind, these are horrid times
Oh, oh, oh
I can't let it bother me

I never thought I'd walk away from you
I did
But it's a false sense of accomplishment every time I quit

Anyone can see my every flaw
It isn't hard
Anyone can say they're above this all
It takes my pain away
It's a lie, a kiss with open eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me

I keep my focus on the simple things
Trying to find some peace along the way
Wish I knew how long I'm supposed to wait
Holding on but just barely

Got the feeling I've been talking to a dead, dead line
There's always a reason to let it change
Is there anyone there listening while you cry, cry, cry?
There's always a reason for the pain

I'm doing the things that I'm told every day, every day, every day
Then why does it feel like I'm moving in place, in place, in place?

Never had anything to prove
But never was anyone like you
All you fought through, all you had to face
Made you stronger, unafraid

Is there anyone there listening while you cry, cry, cry?

The first star I see may not be a star
We can't do a thing but wait
So let's wait for one more

And the time, such clumsy time
In deciding if it's time
I'm careful but not sure how it goes
You can lose yourself in your courage

When the time we have now ends
When the big hand goes round again
Can you still feel the butterflies?
Can you still hear the last goodnight?

And the mindless comfort grows
When I'm alone with my great plans
And this is what she said gets her through it
"If I don't let myself be happy now, then when?
If not now, when?"

When the time we have now ends
When the big hand goes round again
Can you still feel the butterflies?
Can you still hear the last goodnight?
I close my eyes and believe
Wherever you are, an angel for

When the time we have now ends
When the big hand goes round again
Can you still feel the butterflies?
Can you still hear the last goodnight?2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well you're just across the street
Looks a mile to my feet
I want to go to you
Funny how I'm nervous still
I've always been the easy kill
I guess I always will

Could it be that everything goes round by chance?
Or only one way that it was always meant to be
You kill me, you always know the perfect thing to say
Hey hey, hey hey
I know what I should do but I just can't walk away

I can picture your face well from the bar in my hotel
I wish I'd go to you
I'll pick up, put down the phone
Like your favorite Heatmiser song goes
"It's just like being alone."

Oh god, please don't tell me this has been in vain
I need answers for what all the waiting I've done means
You kill me, you've got some nerve but can't face your mistakes
Hey hey, hey hey
I know what I should do but I just can't turn away
So go on, love
Leave while there's still hope for escape
Gotta take what you can these days
There's so much ahead and so much regret
I know what you want to say
I know it but can't help feeling differently
I loved you and I should have said it
But tell me just what has it ever meant?

I can't help it baby, this is who I am
Sorry, sorry, but I can't just go turn off how I feel
You kill me, you build me up but just to watch me break
Hey hey, hey hey
I know what I should do but I just can't walk awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

If you only once would let me
Only just one time
Then be happy with the consequence
With whatever's going to happen tonight
Don't think we're not serious
When's it ever not?
The love we make is give and it's take
I'm game to play along

All I can say I shouldn't say

Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time

All the best DJs are saving their slowest song for last
When the dance is through, it's me and you
Come on, would it really be so bad?
The things we think might be the same
But I won't fight for more
It's just not me to wear it on my sleeve
Count on that for sure
All I can say I shouldn't say

Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time
You want to take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time
Yeah, we still have time

I can't say I was never wrong
But some blame rests on you
Work and play, they're never okay to mix the way we do

All I can say, I shouldn't say

Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time
You want to take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time

The clever ways I try to change
Happen and pass leaving me the same
Of course it must be something else
Leading questions I might ask myself

Sure and certain
Wander 'til we're old
Lost and lurking
Wonder 'til we're cold

What you do works for a time
Until you drop without a warning sign
If you keep going on like this
I'll be one more thing for you to miss

Steady

Before this world starts up again
It's me and night
We wait for the sun
The kids and drunks head back inside
Well, there's lots of smart ideas in books I've never read
When the girls come talk to me, I wish to hell I had

(Get up, get up) Turn the ignition
(Get up, get up) Fire up the system
Play my little part in something big

I'll accept with poise, with grace
When they draw my name from the lottery
And they'll say, "All the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice."
I'm the one who gets away
I'm a New Jersey success story
And they'll say, "Lord, give me a chance to shake that hand."
(They'll say)

Back when I was younger, I was someone you'd've liked
Got an old guitar I've had for years I'd let you buy
And I'll tell you something else that you ain't dying enough to know
There's still some living left when your prime comes and goes
(Get up, get up) Dance on the ceiling
(Get up, get up) Boy, you must be dreaming
Rock on young saviour, don't give up your hopes

I'll accept with poise, with grace
When they draw my name from the lottery
And they'll say, "All the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice."
I'm the one who gets away
I'm a New Jersey success story
And they'll say, "Lord, give me a chance to shake that hand."

I have one last wish
And it's from my heart
Just let me down
Just let me down, easy

I'll accept with poise, with grace
When they draw my name from the lottery
And they'll say, "All the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice."
I'm the one who gets away
I'm a New Jersey success story
And they'll say, "Lord, give me a chance to shake his hand."

Don't they treat you like they should?
Did you take them for it?
For every penny that you could?
We once walked out on the beach and once I almost touched your hand
Oh how I dreamed to finally say such things
Then only to pretend

Don't you know I'm thinking (know I'm thinking)
Driving 405 past midnight
You know I miss you (don't you know that I miss you?)
Ninth and Ash on a Tuesday night
I would write to you from Museum Mile
A toast to you: your whisper, your smile
Up the stairs at Weatherford
A ghost each place I hide

If you don't, don't know, why would you say so?
Would you mean this please if it happens?
If you don't know, why would you say so?
Won't you get your story straight
If you don't know, honey, why'd you just say so?
'Cause I need this now more than I ever did
If you don't well, honey, then you don't
I left you waiting (I know I left you waiting)
At the least could we be friends?
Should have never started (never started)
Ain't that the way it always ends?
On my life I'll try today
There's so much I've felt I should say but
Even if your heart would listen
I doubt I could explain

If you don't don't know, why'd you say so?
Would you mean this please if it happens?
If you don't know, why would you say so?

If you don't well, honey, then you don't
If you don't well, honey, then you don't


So here we are now
A sip of wine a sip of water
Someday maybe
Maybe someday we'll be smarter
And I'm sorry that I'm such a mess
I drank all my money could get and
Took everything you let me have
And then I never loved you back
If you don't don't know, why would you say so?
Would you mean the please if it happens?
If you don't know, why would you say so?
Won't you get your story straight?
If you don't know, honey, why'd you just say so?

I know I've made mistakes
I've always been afraid

A thousand nights or more

But please answer the door

Can you tell me?

You say that love goes anywhere

But you're killing everything in me

Get down on your knees
Whisper what I need

Do you really want the sugar pill?

As the train approaches Gare Du Nord
As I'm sure your kiss remains employed
Am I only dreaming?

I don't stand a chance
Against the glow of answers
Lighting up your face across the pillow landscape
The list of things

News to me that I would need a second wake up

It's all been happening

Am I weak if I want to fight?

What makes our love so hard to be?
Is it you? Or is that you with me?
For just the possibility
I'd have given anything
We play along, we sell
But only so much we can tell ourselves
Is it you? Or is it that you with me?
You with me

Pull like magnets
Cloud of static
The air between is punishing, but nothing happens
Scared to say it

Expecting different outcomes with a better question

Fear and comfort
Are both one the same

Going out, we hope to lose ourselves
Then get found in unlikely places
A little presumption's all you need
To end up empty
Who really says they hope they'll meet the one
For the first time at a bar drinking early?
Easy enough to say "Hey man, I'm done"
And never hear them say

Oh, honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We go all the way
But how am I supposed to know, oh, no
When to let the feelings show?
Honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We take it all the way
And no one really knows, oh, no
When to let the feelings show, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-oh, oh-oh

We get discouraged by the pointlessness
And we're pretty quick to judge things pointless
There's what I want and what I need
And the latter takes a while to see
It doesn't matter how often, how old
It starts with an awkward beginning
I believe that what I've learned has worth
And what I choose to do means something
So honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We go all the way
But how am I supposed to know, oh, no
When to let the feelings show?
Honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We take it all the way
'Cause no one really knows, oh, no

Crowds and the noise receding
Down to just you and me, yeah
We could do anything you want

So honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We go all the way
But how am I supposed to know, oh, no
When to let the feelings show?
Honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We take it all the way
Whoever really knows, oh, no
When to let the feelings show? Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh
When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh
When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh
When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh
When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh
When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
