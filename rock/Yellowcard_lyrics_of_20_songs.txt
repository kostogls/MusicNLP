There's a place off Ocean Avenue
Where I used to sit and talk with you
We were both sixteen and it felt so right
Sleepin' all day, stayin' up all night
Stayin' up all night

There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street
We would walk on the beach in our bare feet
We were both eighteen and it felt so right
Sleepin' all day, stayin' up all night
Stayin' up all night

If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

There's a piece of you that's here with me
It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see
When I sleep, I dream, and it gets me by
I can make-believe that you're here tonight
That you're here tonight
If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

I remember the look in your eyes
When I told you that this was goodbye
You were beggin' me, not tonight
Not here, not now
We're looking up at the same night sky (Ooh)
And keep pretendin' the sun will not rise (Ooh)
We'll be together for one more night (Ooh)
Somewhere, somehow

If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Broken this fragile thing now
And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces
And I've thrown my words all around
But I can't, I can't give you a reason

I feel so broken up (So broken up)
And I give up (I give up)
I just want to tell you so you know

Here I go, scream my lungs out
And try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one
That gets me like you do
You are my only, my only one

Made my mistakes, let you down
And I can't, I can't hold on for too long
Ran my whole life in the ground
And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone

And something's breaking up (Breaking up)
I feel like giving up (Like giving up)
I won't walk out until you know
Here I go, scream my lungs out
And try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one
That gets me like you do
You are my only, my only one


Here I go, so dishonestly
Leave a note for you, my only one
And I know you can see right through me
So let me go and you will find someone

Here I go, scream my lungs out
And try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one
No one like you
You are my only, my only one
My only one
My only one
You're my only one
You are my only, my only one14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Eyes are feeling heavy but they never seem to close
The fan blades on the ceiling spin but the air is never cold
And even though you are next to me I still feel so alone
I just can't give you anything for you to call your own

And I can feel you breathing
And it's keeping me awake
Can you feel it beating?
My heart's sinking like a weight

Something I've been keeping locked away behind my lips
I can feel it breaking free with each and every kiss
I couldn't bear to hurt you but it's all so different now
Things that I was sure of, they have filled me up with doubt

And I can feel you breathing
And it's keeping me awake
Can you feel it beating?
My heart's sinking like a weight
I can feel you breathing
It's keeping me awake
Could you stop my heart? It's always beating
Sinking like a weight
How am I supposed to feel about the things I've done?
I don't know if i should stay or turn around and run
I know that I hurt you, things will never be the same
The only love I ever knew, I threw it all away

And I can feel you breathing
And it's keeping me awake
Can you feel it beating?
My heart's sinking like a weight
I can feel you breathing
It's keeping me awake
Could you stop my heart? It's always beating
Sinking like a weight6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Think about the love inside, the strength of heart
Think about the heroes saving life in the dark
Climbing higher through the fire, time was running out
Never knowing you weren't going to be coming down alive
But you still came back for me
You were strong and you believed

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Be strong, believe
Be strong, believe

Think about the chance I never had to say
Thank you for giving up your life that day
Never fearing, only hearing voices calling out
Let it all go, the life that you know, just to bring it down alive
And you still came back for me
You were strong and you believed

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Be strong, believe
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Be strong, believe
(Again today, we take into our hearts and minds those who perished on this site one year ago
And also those who came to toil in the rubble to bring order out of chaos, to help us make sense of our despair.)
Wanna hold my wife when I get home
Wanna tell the kids they'll never know how much I love to see them smile
Wanna make a change or two right now
Wanna live a life like you somehow
Wanna make your sacrifice worthwhile

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Be strong, believe
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Be strong, believe

Think about the love inside, the strength of heart
Think about the heroes saving life in the dark
Think about the chance I never had to say
Thank you for giving up your life that day

Accidents out on the highway to somewhere
They tell us about when we're young
Rescuers working to clean up the crashes
Before she can see what they've done
Nobody told her she'd lose in the first round
The last fight was fixed from the start
Names on her sidewalks, they move through her body
Like razors, they cut through her heart
Like razors, they cut through her heart

Hey, let go of all you know
And you're flying away now
What have you got to lose?
And say out loud these words I've found
I'll be there when you come down
I'll be waiting for you

Night life, the high life, she just wants a good life
So someone remembers her too
But somewhere she heard there was some place to go
When you die, when you live like we do
Die when you live like we do
Hey, let go of all you know
And you're flying away now
What have you got to lose?
And say out loud these words I've found
I'll be there when you come down
I'll be waiting for you

Hey, let go of all you know
And you're flying away now
What have you got to lose?
And say out loud these words I've found
I'll be there when you come down
I'll be waiting for you

I think I'm breaking out
I'm gonna leave you now
There's nothing for me here, it's all the same
And even though I know
That everything might go
Go downhill from here, I'm not afraid

Way away away from here I'll be
Way away away so you can see
How it feels to be alone and not believe
(Feels to be alone and not believe)
Feels to be alone and not believe anything

You can't stop me now
You can't hold me down
You can't keep me here, I'm on my way
I've made it this far now
And I'm not burning out
No matter what you say, I'm not afraid

Way away away from here I'll be
Way away away so you can see
How it feels to be alone and not believe
(Feels to be alone and not believe)
Feels to be alone and not believe anything
Letting out the noise inside of me
(Letting out the noise inside of me)
Every window pane is shattering
(Every window pane is shattering)
Cutting up my words before I speak
(Cutting up my words)
This is how it feels to not believe
Letting out the noise inside of me

Hello you, how was the rest?
You made it through but nevertheless
I got you out on a wire
You be love and I'll be a liar
Tell it all and fill up the air
But make it loud cause nobody's there
Nobody’s there
Nobody’s there

Stop, turn, take a look around
At all the lights and sounds
Let them bring you in
Slow burn, let it all fade out
Pull the curtain down
And wonder where you’ve been

Make it new but stay in the lines
Just let go but keep it inside
Smile big for everyone
Even when you know what they've done
They gave you the end but not where to start
Not how to build, how to tear it apart
So tell it all and fill up the air
But make it loud cause nobody's there
Nobody’s there
Stop, turn, take a look around
At all the lights and sounds
Let them bring you in
Slow burn, let it all fade out
Pull the curtain down
And wonder where you’ve been

I've got a way to work this out
I've got a way and you know how
I've got a way to work this out
I've got a way and you know how
I've got a way to work this out
I've got a way

Stop, turn, take a look around
At all the lights and sounds
Let them bring you in
Slow burn, let it all fade out
Pull the curtain down
And wonder where you’ve been
You’ve earned everything you’ve found
And painted faces frown
I'll say I knew you when3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Call me out, you stayed inside
The one you love is where you hide
Shot me down, as I flew by
Crash and burn, I think sometimes
You forget where the heart is
Answer "no" to these questions
Let her go, learn a lesson
It's not me, you're not listening
Now, can't you see? Something's missing
You forget where the heart is

Take you away
From that empty apartment you stay
And forget where the heart is, someday
If ever you loved me you'd say "it's okay"

Waking up from this nightmare
How's your life? What's it like there?
Is it all what you want it to be?
Does it hurt when you think about me
And how broken my heart is?

It's okay to be angry and never let go
It only gets harder the more that you know
When you get lonely, if no one's around
You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down
We came together, but you left alone
And I know how it feels to walk out on your own
Maybe some day I will see you again
And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend

Hmmmm...
I found out in the fall, I've been gone
On the road for a year
She said, "Honey, I've got real bad news"
And then there were just tears
And we would never be the same again
Since then I've often wondered
What you might have been like
How it would have felt to hold you
Would you have had my eyes?
Don't you think we would've been best friends?

You would be ten and I'd be
Driving you to school
You would tell all your friends
That you thought I was cool
And you would have
All the love in my heart
Yeah, you would have
All the love in my heart

We were twenty-two years young then
Breaking rules all around
We were moving in that first apartment
It felt like it was never gonna end
Both so lost and crazy
We were young so we ran
Now I live in a dream where I am
Holding your little hands
I never got to meet you, my best friend
You would be ten and I'd be
Driving you to school
You would tell all your friends
That you thought I was cool
You would be out in the sun
Until it was gone
You would be watching Star Wars
With your PJs on
And you would have
All the love in my heart
Yeah, you would have
All the love in my heart

Don't you think we would have been best friends?

You would be ten and I'd be
Driving you to school
You would tell all your friends
That you thought I was cool
You would be out in the sun
Until it was gone
You would be watching Star Wars
With your PJs on
You would be playing tunes on
On your first guitar
You would be harmony to
Every single part of me
And you have
All the love in my heart
Yeah, you would have
All the love in my heart
Hmmmm...1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

It was the best that you could be for me
I think we were lucky just to stay alive
Even when you had only fire to breathe
I know you were only trying to make it right

Change everything I've ever known
Try once again to let you go

If you could go back now, would you say it differently?
If there was no one there, would you open up for me?
If this was the last time that we would ever speak
Could we forgive somehow, could we let it rest in peace?

Stories are lost somewhere behind your eyes
You are a dying breed, you stand alone
I couldn't get through no matter how I tried
You tore me apart but still I love you so

Change everything I've ever known
Try once again to let you go
If you could go back now, would you say it differently?
If there was no one there, would you open up for me?
If this was the last time that we would ever speak

Left the ground
In black and white
And when the plane went down
The colors all around
I know by now
The margin’s slight
And still I can't get out
She's all I think about, can't let her go
It's who you know

We came down to watch the world walk by
And all she found was trouble in my eyes
From the sky she pulled me down tonight
Let her go
Let her go
She moves fast, takes control
And like a heart attack I know I can't turn back
And time just passed
Nights moved slow
And she was all I had
I thought I'd never last, can't let her go
It's who you know
 x2
She calls out the farther that I fly
I love that sound so give me one more line
And from the sky she pulled me down tonight
Let her go
Let her go
Let her go
Let her go3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Watch winter melt away
Look for longer days
The sun comes out
Come up from under ground
Stop covering your eyes
Wasting precious time on yesterdays
It's written on your face
But you've got time
You've got time

Change comes for you
Even if you're hiding out
So wake to this truth
And maybe you'll believe me now

Whatever lies ahead
The things that we have said will slowly fade
Nothing can remain
Feel darkness and the light
Wrestle in your mind
You know it's there
It's always been right there
And you've got time
You've still got time
Change comes for you
Even if you're hiding out
So wake to this truth
And maybe you'll believe me now
No safety in illusions
Of a place where you belong
So take hold of me
And hang on until the hurt is gone
The hurt is gone
Yeah, it's gone

Tell me why I'm here Dad
Whisper in my ear that

Proud that you were my Dad

Took me by the hand and

Sew this up with threads of reason and regret
So i will not forget. I will not forget
How this felt one year six months ago
I know i cannot forget. I cannot forget

I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do
Follow me there
A beautiful somewhere
A place that i can share with you

I can tell that you don't know me anymore
It's easy to forget, sometimes we just forget
And being on this road is anything but sure
Maybe we'll forget, i hope we don't forget


So many nights, legs tangled tight
Wrap me up in a dream with you
Close up these eyes, try not to cry
All that i've got to pull me through is memories of you
Memories of you
Memories of you
Memories of you
I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do
Follow me there
A beautiful somewhere
A place that we can share

I'm just so tired
Won't you sing me to sleep?
And fly through my dreams
So I can hitch a ride with you tonight
And get away from this place
Get a new name and face
I just ain't the same without you in my life

Late night drives
All alone in my car
I can't help but start
Singing lines from all our favorite songs
And melodies in the air
Singing "Life just ain't fair"
Sometimes I still just can't believe you're gone

And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Maybe we'll make it through one more year
Down here

Feel your fire
When it's cold in my heart
And things sorta start
Reminding me of my last night with you
I only need one more day
Just one more chance to say
"I wish that I had gone up with you too"
And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Maybe we'll make it through one more year
Down here
You won't be coming back
And I didn't get to say goodbye (goodbye)
I really wish I'd got to say goodbye

And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Maybe we'll make it through one more year
Down here

I hope that all is well in heaven
Cause it's all shot to hell down here
I hope that I find you in heaven
Cause I'm so lost without you down here
You won't be coming back
And I didn't get to say goodbye (goodbye)
I really wish I'd got to say goodbye1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Looking for something to waken my soul
It seems like its singing stopped cold
I got used to being the star of the show
But I've seen the lights come and go
I heard a song playing brought by the wind
I got myself lost, then I found you again
Tennessee, when I finally lay down to sleep
Then I'll rest in your ground
But these days the world is against us
So keep me safe with your fields and fences around me
I want to start living
I want to be brave
I want to find where I belong
'Cause I still remember the reasons I write
Things that I've dreamed for so long
I heard a song playing brought by the wind
I got myself lost, then I found you again
Tennessee, when I finally lay down to sleep
Then I'll rest in your ground
But these days the world is against us
So keep me safe with your fields and fences around me, around me
I don't have much that I can give to you
But I know I love the way you make me feel like I'm at home
And I am not alone
I don't have much that I can give to you
But I know I love the way you make me feel like I'm at home
And I am not alone
I don't have much that I can give to you
But I know I love the way you make me feel like I'm at home
And I am not alone
I don't have much that I can give to you
But I know I love the way you make me feel like I'm at home

Dear Bobbie
Do you remember when you were young and very pretty? I do
I remember pleated skirts, black and white saddle shoes
Do you remember dancing half the night?
I do, I still think of you when we dance
Although we can't jitterbug as we did then

Do you remember when
How long has it been?
1945, you opened my blue eyes
To see a whole new life
Do you remember when
I told you this that night?
That if you're by my side
When every day begins
I'll fall for you again
I made a promise when
I told you this that night

I'll be fine
Cause when i die, then i die loving you
It's alright, i'll be fine
When i die then i die loving you
Loving you, loving you
Do you remember the times we would give up on each other then get back together
Then we finally was married in 1949
We drove the yellow convertible on our honeymoon
Do you remember? I do

Life has led us here
Together all these years
This house that we have made
Holds 20,000 days
The memories we've saved
Since life has led us here


I'm coming home to you
Slipping off my shoes
Resting in my chair
I see you standing there
The silver in your hair
I'm coming home to you
When i lay tonight
When i close my eyes
I know the sun will rise
Here or the next life
As long as you're still mine, then it's alright

You have grey hair now
But you are a beautiful woman
And the years have been good to both of us
We walk slow now, but we still have each other
The glue of love is still bonding us together
Love is what i remember. Do you remember?6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Look at me and listen close
So I can tell you how I feel before I go
Just a year, it's not much time
For me to show you
I am proud that you are mine

I wish I had known
The future in my heart
Was just about to start

Say tomorrow
I can't follow you there
Just close your eyes
And sing for me
I will hear you
Always near you
And I'll give you the words
Just sing for me

Every lock, on every door
I put them there to try and hide you from the world
And you kicked, yeah, you screamed
You never understood you're everything to me
I just hope you know
The future in your heart
Is just about to start

Say tomorrow
I can't follow you there
Just close your eyes
And sing for me
I will hear you
Always near you
And I'll give you the words
Just sing for me

No looking back when I am gone
(Sing for me)
Follow your heart, it's never wrong
(Sing for me)
No looking back when I am gone
(Sing for me)
Don't second guess the note you're on

Out of time
All out of fight
You are the only thing in life that I got right
Say tomorrow
I can't follow you there
Just close your eyes
And sing for me
I will hear you
Always near you
And I'll give you the words
Just sing for me

Just close your eyes
And sing for me
Just close your eyes
And sing for me2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I cannot hold this anymore
My hands are tired of only waiting to let go
And I am waiting... still
I used to know which way to turn
You were a light inside a tunnel in my head
I try to follow... still
I try to follow... still

It's hard to see you, we are older now
And when I find you, you just turn around
This is a black and white of you I've found
I hang you up and then I pull you down
I hang you up and then I pull you down

No more apologies from me
My arms are tired of picking up what I put down
You're all I think of... still
I'm gonna miss you everyday
I turn my back on anyone who won't believe it
And it gets lonely... still
It gets lonely... still

It's hard to see you, we are older now
And when I find you, you just turn around
This is a black and white of you I've found
I hang you up and then I pull you down
I hang you up and then I pull you down
I get lost sometimes
Another year flies by
But I know if I try
Memories of the light in your eyes
Can take me back in time

It's hard to see you, we are older now
And when I find you, you just turn around
This is a black and white of you I've found
I hang you up and then I pull you down
It's hard to see you we are older now

And when I find you, you just turn around
