I was born in the desert
I been down for years
Jesus, come closer
I think my time is near
And I've traveled over
Dry earth and floods
Hell and high water
To bring you my love

Climbed over mountains
Traveled the sea
Cast out off heaven
Cast down on my knees
I've lain with the devil
Cursed god above
Forsaken heaven
To bring you my love

To bring you my love
To bring you my love
To bring you my love

I know he's gonna be here

Can you hear them?
The helicopters?
I'm in New York
No need for words now
We sit in silence
You look me
In the eye directly
You met me
I think it's Wednesday
The evening
The mess we're in and

The city sunset over me
The city sunset over me

Night and day
I dream of
Making love
To you now baby
Love-making
On-screen
Impossible dream
And I have seen
The sunrise
Over the river
The freeway
Reminding
Of this mess we're in and
The city sunset over me
The city sunset over me
The city sunset over me
The city sunset over me

What were you wanting?
What was it you wanted?
I just wanna say
I just wanna say
Don’t ever change
Don’t ever change now, baby
And thank you
And thank you
I don’t think we will meet again
I don’t think we will meet again
And you must leave now
And you must leave now
Before the sun rises over the skyscrapers
Before the sunrise above skyscrapers
And the city landscape comes into being
Sweat on my skin
The city
Oh, this mess we’re in
The city sunset over me
The city sunset over me
The city sunset over me

I lost my heart
Under the bridge
To that little girl
So much to me
And now I moan
And now I holler
She'll never know
Just what I found

That blue-eyed girl
(That blue-eyed girl)
She said, "No more."
(She said, "No more.")
And that blue-eyed girl
(That blue-eyed girl)
Became blue-eyed whore
('Came blue-eyed whore)
Down by the water
(Down by the water)
I took her hand
(I took her hand)
Just like my daughter
(Just like my daughter)
Won't see her again

Oh help me, Jesus
Come through this storm
I had to lose her
To do her harm
I heard her holler
(I heard her holler)
I heard her moan
(I heard her moan)
My lovely daughter

I took her home

A revolving wheel of metal chairs
Hung on chains, squealing
Four little children flying out
A blind man sings in Arabic

Hey little children don’t disappear
(I heard it was 28,000)
Lost upon a revolving wheel
(I heard it was 28,000)

Now you see them, now you don’t
Children vanish ‘hind vehicle
Now you see them, now you don’t
Faces, limbs, a bouncing skull

Hey little children don’t disappear
(I heard it was 28,000)
All that’s left after a year
(I heard it was 28,000)
A faded face, the trace of an ear
(I heard it was 28,000)
A tableau of the missing
Tied to the government building
8,000 sun-bleached photographs
Faded with the roses

Hey little children don’t disappear
(I heard it was 28,000)
Lost upon a revolving wheel

All that’s left after a year

Threw my bad fortune
Off the top of
A tall building
I'd rather done it with you
Your boy's smile
Five in the morning
Looked into your eyes
And I was really in love
In Chinatown
Hungover
You showed me
Just what I could do
Talking about
Time travel
And the meaning
And just what it was worth

And I feel like some bird of paradise
My bad fortune slipping away
And I feel the innocence of a child
Everybody's got something good to say

Things I once thought
Unbelievable
In my life
Have all taken place
When we walked through
Little Italy
I saw my reflection
Come right off your face
I paint pictures
To remember
You're too beautiful
To put into words
Like a gypsy
You dance in circles
All around me
And all over the world
And I feel like some bird of paradise
My bad fortune slipping away
And I feel the innocence of a child
Everybody's got something good to say
And I feel like some bird of paradise
My bad fortune slipping away
And I feel the innocence of a child
Everybody's got something good to say

So I take my
Good fortune
And I fantasize
Of our leaving
Like some modern day
Gypsy landslide
Like some modern day
Like some modern day
Bonnie and Clyde

Joseph walked on and on
The sunset went down and down
Coldness cooled their desire
And Dawn said, "Let's build a fire"

The sun dressed the trees in green
And Joe said, "Dawn, I feel like a king"
And Dawn's neck and her feet were bare
Sweetness in her golden hair

Said, "I'm not scared"
Turned to her and smiled
Secrets in his eyes
Sweetness of desire

Is this desire, enough, enough
To lift us higher, to lift above?

"Hour long by hour, may we two stand
When we're dead, between these lands"
The sun set behind his eyes
And Joe said, "Is this desire?"
Is this desire, enough, enough
To lift us higher, to lift above?
Is this desire, enough, enough
Enough inside? Is this desire?3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

They took one of the old notorious housing projects, and they leveled it and rebuilt it as "Mixed Income Housing". It's called "Hope Six," and it's supposed to... sort of rejuvenate everything. It certainly looks a lot better

Here's the Hope Six Demolition Project
Stretching down to Benning Road
A well-known "pathway of death"
At least that's what I'm told
And here's the one sit-down restaurant
In Ward Seven, nice
OK, now this is just drug town
Just zombies, but that's just life

In the Community of Hope

The Community of Hope, hope, hope, hope

Here's the highway to death and destruction
South Capitol is its name
And the school just looks like a shit-hole
Does that look like a nice place?

Now the Homeland Security Base
And here's God's Deliverance Centre

The west's asleep, let England shake
Weighted down with silent dead
I fear our blood won't rise again
Won't rise again

England's dancing days are done
Another day, Bobby, for you to come
Home and tell me indifference
Is won, won, won

Smile, smile Bobby, with your lovely mouth
Pack up your troubles and let's head out
To the fountain of death and splash about
Swim back, forth, back, back, laugh out loud

Until the day is ending
And the birds are silent
And the insects are courting
And by the shores, heavy stones are falling

Smile, smile Bobby, with your lovely mouth
Pack up your troubles and let's head out
To the fountain of death and splash about
Swim back, forth, back, back, laugh out loud3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Put on that dress
I'm going out dancing
Starting off red
Clean and sparkling, he'll see me

Music play, make it dreamy for dancing
Must be a way that I can dress to please him
It's hard to walk in the dress, it's not easy
I'm swinging over like a heavy-loaded fruit tree

If you put it on, if you put it on
If you put it on, if you put it on

It's sad to see
Lonely, all this lonely
Close up my eyes
Dreamy, dreamy music, make it be alright

Music play, make it good for romancing
Must be a way I can dress to please him
Swing and sway, everything'll be alright
But it's feeling so damn tight tonight
If you put it on, if you put it on
If you put it on, if you put it on

"You purdy thang," my man says
"But I bought you beautiful dresses"
"You purdy thang," my man says
"But I bought you beautiful dresses"

Filthy tight, the dress is filthy
I'm falling flat, and my arms are empty
Clear the way, better get it out of this room

He came dressed in black with a cross bearing my name
He came bathed in light and splendor and glory
I can't believe what the lord has finally sent me

He said, "Dance for me, fanciulla gentile"
He said, "Laugh awhile, I can make your heart feel"

And then cry with joy at the depth of my love"

'Cause I've prayed days, I've prayed nights
For the lord just to send me home some sign

To bring peace to my black and empty heart

My love will stay 'till the river bed run dry
And my love lasts long as the sunshine blue sky
I love him longer as each damn day goes

Blown and shot out beyond belief
Arms and legs were in the trees
I've seen and done things I want to forget;

Longing to see a woman's face
Instead of the words that gather pace

Flesh quivering in the heat

Goddamn Europeans
Take me back to beautiful England
And the grey, damp filthiness of ages
And battered books
And fog rolling down behind the mountains
On the graveyards and dead sea captains
Let me walk through the stinking alleys
To the music of drunken beatings
Past the Thames river, glistening like gold
Hastily sold for nothing, nothing
Let me watch night fall on the river
The moon rise up and turn to silver
The sky move, the ocean shimmer
The hedge shake, the last living rose quiver3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
