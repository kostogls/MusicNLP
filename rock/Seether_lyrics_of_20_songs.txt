I wanted you to know that I love the way you laugh
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away
I keep your photograph and I know it serves me well
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

Because I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away

You've gone away
You don't feel me here anymore

The worst is over now and we can breathe again
I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away
There's so much left to learn and no one left to fight
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

Who's to know if your soul will fade at all?
The one you sold to fool the world
You lost your self esteem along the way, yeah

It seems like every day's the same
And I'm left to discover on my own
It seems like everything is gray
And there's no color to behold

They say it's over, and I'm fine again, yeah
Try to stay sober, feels like I'm dyin' here

And I am aware now of how everything's gonna be fine
One day, too late, I'm in Hell
I am prepared now, seems everyone's gonna be fine
One day, too late, just as well

I feel the dream in me expire
And there's no one left to blame it on
I hear you label me a liar

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all it's sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
These guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
These guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We hurt each other with the things we wanna say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
Now who's gonna dance with me
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
These guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

All I really want is something beautiful to say
All I really want is something beautiful to say

Keep me locked up in your broken mind
I keep searching, never been able to find
A light behind your dead eyes
Not anything at all

You keep living in your own lie
Ever deceitful and ever unfaithful
Keep me guessing, keep me terrified
Take everything from my world

Say can you help me right before the fall
Take what you can and leave me to the wolves

Keep me dumb, keep me paralyzed
Why try swimming? I'm drowning in fables
You're not that saint that you externalize
You're not anything at all
It's oh, so playful when you demonize
To spit out the hateful, you're willing and able
Your words are weapons of the terrified
You're nothing in my world

Say can you help me right before the fall
Take what you can and leave me to the wolves

All I really want is something beautiful to say
Keep me guessing, keep me terrified

Throw your dollar bills and leave your thrills all here with me
And speak, but don't pretend I won't defend you anymore, you see
It aches in every bone
I'll die alone, but not for you
My eyes don't need to see that ugly thing
I know it's me, you fear
If you want me, hold me back

Frail, the skin is dry and pale
The pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high
Just leave 'em where they lie
And tell yourself you'll be the death of me

I don't need a friend, I need to mend so far away
So come, sit by the fire and play a while
But you can't stay too long
It aches in every bone
I'll die alone, but not for pleasure
I see my heart explode
It's been eroded by the weather here
If you want me, hold me back
Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie
And tell yourself you'll be the death of me
Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie
And tell yourself you'll be the death of me

Hold your eyes closed, take me in
Hold your eyes closed, take me in

Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie
And tell yourself you'll be the death of me

If I could speak, I'd tell you all my fears and deprivations
If I could feel, I'd take away your pain
If I could bleed, I'd show you all my scars and imperfections
If I could breathe, I'd hold you in my veins

You've got me feeling like an animal
Beat down in fear and paralyzed
You've got me feeling like I have no other hand to hold in this assisted suicide

So say something beautiful
Say what you're keeping inside
This anticipation, I will only let you down
Say something meaningful
Say what you're trying to hide
This anticipation, I will only let you down

If I could breed, I'd show you all my infantile obsessions
If I could sleep, I'd hold you in my head
If I was strong, I'd keep you close and render you defenseless
If I was gone, I'd hope you take my place

You've got me feeling like an animal
Beat down in fear and paralyzed

I'm a whisper lost upon wind
I'm the ember that will burn you down
I'm the water that will drown you
I'm a star that's just a black hole now
I'm a terrifying danger
I'm a fruit decaying on the ground
I'm a swallower of anger
I'm the tree that falls that makes no sound
I make no sound

Cause if I stand up, I break my bones
Everybody loves to see a fall unfold
Ain't nobody giving up
Cause nobody gives a fuck
Stand up, break my bones
Everybody wants what they just can't hold
There's nobody praying for me

I am fungus in the forest
I'm a lizard with a poisoned tongue
I'm the child in the manger
I'm the one who sacrificed his son
Rust is showing on my armor
I am wheezing like an old man done
I'm a product of my anger
I'm the bullet in a loaded gun
Stand up, I break my bones
Everybody loves to see a fall unfold
Ain't nobody giving up

So take them off
The blinders that cover your eyes
Don't break new ground
Just follow the beaten path
Well all I can do in the end is bury it in the cellar
And only a fool would pretend to blame it on the weather

It's so dangerous all this blamelessness
And I feel like I lost all the good I've known
It's so dangerous all this shamelessness
And I feel like I'm watching a tumor grow

Now take them down
The roses you smothered they died
I hear the cries of souls you have eaten since
We all must revere and defend the fortune of the teller
We all must subdue and suspend belief that this gets better

It's so dangerous all this blamelessness
And I feel like I lost all the good I've known
It's so dangerous all this shamelessness
And I feel like I'm watching a tumor grow
Please just say you know
You won't be satisfied

God I hope you choke
On hate and stomach bile
Even as you sing the praise of feticide

The sun is gone and the flowers rot
Words are spaces between us
And I should have been drowned
In the rivers I found of token lost
And I should have been down
When you made me insecure

So break me down if it makes you feel right
And hate me now if it keeps you all right
Oh, you can break me down if it takes all your might
Because I'm so much more
Than meets the eye

And I'm the one you can never trust
Because wounds are ways to reveal us
And yeah, I could have tried
And devoted my life to both of us
But what a waste of my time
When the world we have is yours

So break me down if it makes you feel right
And hate me now if it keeps you all right

Those voices yelling
And the pain is overwhelming
It's a faultline
And yeah, I'm guessing
That I should be kinda happy
It's a fault of mine

With all the tension
You still keep me second-guessing
'Cause I'm so benign
(Go on, go on, go)
And yeah, I know
It's kinda hard to let it go
It's all so asinine
(Go on, go on, go)

We have to figure out another way to go
(So I can follow, so I can follow)
We have to figure out another way to go

Betray and degrade me now
I'll savour how this emptiness defines you
And take from this tortured sound
My hands are bound
Your shallowness confines you
I'm never the same, I'm never enough
There's something dead inside me
I fell all alone and couldn't get up
With no one there to guide me

We have to figure out another way to go
(So I can follow, so I can follow)
We have to figure out another way to go

Betray and degrade me now
I'll savor how this emptiness defines you
And take from this tortured sound

I was born to fly away
And run across the sun
It faded out, like a candle in the breeze
Fadin' now, like I'm supposed to

So every day I'm against the wall
With nowhere to turn to
And if I dare to believe at all
It leaves me deflated

My mind begins to stray
And my thoughts begin to run
I've played it out, I can't seem to find the peace
I've heard about, am I not supposed to?

So every day I could lose it all
Don't let this concern you
So will you catch me if I fall
And keep me elated
It's not complicated

And if I knew I could change it all
I'd hope that you waited
(Can't be broken down)

Take the light
And darken everything around me
Call the clouds
And listen closely, I'm lost without you

Call your name every day
When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down
But I'll rise above this, rise above this doubt

Hate the mind
Regrets are better left unspoken
For all we know
This void will grow and everything's
In vain
Distressing you though it leaves me open
Feels so right
But I'll end this all before it gets me

Call your name every day
When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down
But I'll rise above this, rise above this
Call your name every day
When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down
