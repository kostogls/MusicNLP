A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same
But all the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, it's only you and me, yeah

The miles just keep rolling
As the people leave their way to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go
Oh yeah, yeah

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me, yeah
Everything I know, and anywhere I go
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love
And when the last one falls
When it's all said and done
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love
Whoa, oh, oh


I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me...

Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah

I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all I knew, it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

You called me strong, you called me weak
But still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground
If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite


If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might

There's another world inside of me that you may never see
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide
But somewhere in this darkness
There's a light that I can't find
Well maybe it's too far away, yeah
Or maybe I'm just blind
Or maybe I'm just blind

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'd never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone
When your education x-ray
Cannot see under my skin
I won't tell you a damn thing
That I could not tell my friends
Roaming through this darkness
I'm alive, but I'm alone
And part of me is fighting this
But part of me is gone

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared

Breathe in right away
Nothing seems to fill this place
I need this every time
So take your lies, get off my case
Someday I will find
A love that flows through me like this
This will fall away
This will fall away

You're getting closer
To pushing me off of life's little edge
'Cause I'm a loser
And sooner or later, you know I'll be dead
You're getting closer
You're holding the rope and I'm taking the fall
'Cause I'm a loser

This is getting old
I can't break these chains that I hold

Looking back at the beginning of this
And how life was
Just you and me lovin' all of our friends
Living life like an ocean
But now the current's only pulling me down
It’s getting harder to breathe
It won’t be too long and I'll be going under
Can you save me from this?

'Cause it’s not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me, it’s not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Ooh, but I won’t go

I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take them away
Oh, but I'm taking them back
'Cause all of this time I've just been too blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friend, this life we live, it's not what we have
It's what we believe in
It's not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me, but it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
But it's not my time, I'm not going
There's a will in me and now I know that
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Ooh, but I won't go
I won't go

There might be more than you believe
(There might be more than you believe)
There might be more than you can see

But it’s not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me, it’s not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
But it’s not my time, I'm not going
There's a will in me and now it’s gonna show
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh
There might be more than you believe

He spends his nights in California
Watching the stars on the big screen
Then he lies awake and he wonders
"Why can’t that be me?"
'Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions
He’s left a lot of things he’d rather not mention right now
But just before he says goodnight
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says

If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?
Now and dreams we run

She spends her days up in the north park
Watching the people as they pass
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream
Is that too much to ask?
With a safe home, and a warm bed
On a quiet little street
All she wants is just that something to hold onto
That’s all she needs
Yeah
If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes

Can anyone tell what I've done?

Can anyone tell where I am?

'Cause now again I've found myself so far down
Away from the Sun that shines into the darkest place
I'm so far down, away from the Sun again
Away from the sun again

One more kiss could be the best thing
But one more lie could be the worst
And all these thoughts are never resting
And you're not something I deserve

In my head, there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world, there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me

I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me, but you don't know who I am

As the plane was touching down
And all I could think about was Monday
Maybe I'd be back around
If this keeps me away much longer
I don't know what I would do
You've got to understand it's a hard life
That I'm going through

And when the night falls in around me
I don't think I'll make it through
I'll use your light to guide the way
'Cause all I think about is you

Well, L.A. is getting kind of crazy
And New York is getting kind of cold

Whenever the lights go down
That's when she comes alive
Ooh ooh
Maybe it's just something that you can only see in the light
Ooh ooh
A pretty little vixen dancing out on the scene
But the lights are shining, so she's keeping it clean
Don't get too close
Boy, don't touch her skin
Or you'll never feel the same way again

If everything you see is what you're believing
Then she'll be holding your heart
And by the time the sun goes down
You won't know who you are
She likes to do it in the dark
She likes to do it in the dark, oh

Whenever the darkness comes, she'll have you right where she wants
Ooh ooh
Just when you think it's all over
It's where it all starts
It sounds like an angel is calling my name
It might be the devil, but they all sound the same
And all her moves won't let you get away
She's gonna make your mind come with you to stay

I guess I just got lost
Being someone else
I tried to kill the pain
Nothin' ever helped
I left myself behind
Somewhere along the way
Hoping to come back around
To find myself someday

Lately, I'm so tired of waiting for you
To say that it's ok, but tell me

Please, would you one time
Just let me be myself
So I can shine with my own light
Let me be myself

Would you let me be myself

I'll never find my heart
Behind someone else
I'll never see the light of day
Living in this cell
It's time to make my way
Into the world I knew
Take back all of these times
That I gave in to you
Lately I'm so tired of waiting for you
To say that it's ok, but tell me

Please, would you one time

Beyond the boundaries of your city's lights
Stand the heroes waiting for your cries
So many times you did not bring this on yourself
When that moment finally comes
I'll be there to help

On that day when you need
Your brothers and sisters to care
I'll be right here

Citizen soldiers
Holding the light for the ones that we guide
From the dark of despair
Standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered
We'll always be ready
Because we will always be there

When there are people crying in the streets
When they're starving for a meal to eat
When they simply need a place to make their beds
Right here underneath my wing
You can rest your head
On that day when you need
Your brothers and sisters to care
I'll be right here

Citizen soldiers
Holding the light for the ones that we guide
From the dark of despair
Standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered
We'll always be ready
Because we will always be there

There... there... there...

Hope and pray that you'll never need me
But rest assured I will not let you down
I'll walk beside you but you may not see me
The strongest among you may not wear a crown

On that day when you need
Your brothers and sisters to care
I'll be right here
On that day when you don't have the strength
For the burden you bear
I'll be right here

Citizen soldiers
Holding the light for the ones that we guide
From the dark of despair
Standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered
We'll always be ready
Because we will always be there4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I am trying hard to find out who I am
They all say that I don't know what I am doing
I say they don't hardly understand

Why can't they remember
What I'll never forget
How these dreams can come undone

You give what you give 'cause they make you
Trapped inside a place that won't take you
And they want you to be what they make you

Everything seems perfect (everything seems perfect)
Everything's OK (everything's OK)
It will all get better now (get better now)

Trapped inside a place that won't take you
And they want you to be what they make you

They say it's better this way
I hope one day I am stronger than I feel
And I hope that it feels different than today

Always waiting for something
Searching for one thing
And I know it has to be there somewhere
All this room without knowing
The way this is going
As long as it takes me anywhere

There's life and there's one dance
There's fate and there's one chance
To find out who I want to be
And I know it's inside of me

I look to the far side
Searching for daylight
Something that is mine, all my own
And loving in hindsight
That won't work for my life
Let me forget all that went wrong

There's life and there's one dance
There's fate and there's one chance
To find out who I want to be
And I know it's inside of me
There's love in so much more
That waits behind that door
There's so much that I want to see

But I'm exhausted and nobody understands how I feel
I'm trying hard to breathe now
But there's no air in my lungs

The open wound she hides
She just keeps it bundled up
And never lets it show
She can't take much more of this
But she can't let it go
And that's ok, she don't want the world

All the things she says
While he's just lying there
Without someone to hear her cry
She slips off into a dream
About a place to hide
And that's ok, she don't want the world

This love she feels
Everything she's ever known
Or ever thought was real
Seems like it's been thrown away
Now how's she gonna live
It's ok, she don't want the world

Those words he never spoke
Haunt her life, the memories
Of all the times before
She tried to show him love
While he would only ask for more
But it's ok, she don't want the world
Softly in her sleep
Pictures of the life she's longing
For slowly appear
She's seen them all before
But somehow never quite this clear
She just smiles, she don't want the world

This love she feels
Everything she's ever known
Or ever thought was real
Seems like it's been thrown away
Now how's she gonna live
It's ok, she don't want the world

A brand new morning shines
As she wakes up alone again
This time to face the day
She swears there's time to make it
As she simply walks away
And it's ok, she don't want the world1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I hope you’re doing fine out there without me
‘Cause I’m not doing so good without you
The things I thought you’d never know about me
Were the things I guess you always understood

So how could I have been so blind for all these years?
Guess I only see the truth through all this fear
And living without you

And everything I have in this world
And all that I’ll ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you
Right here by me

I can’t take another day without you
‘Cause baby, I could never make it on my own
I’ve been waiting so long, just to hold you
And to be back in your arms where I belong

Sorry I can’t always find the words to say
But everything I’ve ever known gets swept away
Inside of your love
And everything I have in this world
And all that I’ll ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you
Right here by me

As the days grow long I see
Time is standing still for me
When you’re not here

Sorry I can’t always find the words to say
But everything I’ve ever known gets swept away
Inside of your love

And everything I have in this world
And all that I’ll ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you
Right here by me
And everything I have in this world
And all that I’ll ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you
Right here by meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
