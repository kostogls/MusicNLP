Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag waving never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday
Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag waving never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday

Well I've never seen us act like this
Our only hope is the minds of kids
And they'll show us a thing or two
Our only weapons are the guns of youth
It's only time before they tighten the noose
Then the hunt will be on for you

The red flag waving never meant the same
No, the red flag waving never meant the same

Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag waving never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday
Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag waving never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday
Like the smallest bee packs a sting
Like a pawn checkmates a king
We'll attack at the crack of dawn
Build a ladder if there's a wall
Don't be afraid to slip and fall
Speak for yourself or they'll speak for you

The red flag waving never meant the same
No, the red flag waving never meant the same

Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag waving never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday
Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag waving never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday

Like a fire, don't need water
Like a jury, needs a liar
Like a riot, don't need order
Like a madman, needs a martyr
We don’t need them, we don't need them
We don’t need them, we don't need them
We don’t need them, we don't need them
We don’t need them, we don't need them
Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag waving never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday
Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag waving never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday

(We don’t need them, we don't need them)
Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
(We don’t need them, we don't need them)
The red flag waving never meant the same
(We don’t need them, we don't need them)
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
(We don’t need them, we don't need them)
When they live in the sins of yesterday
(We don’t need them)11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

I hitched a ride until the coast
To leave behind all of my ghosts
Searching for something I couldn’t find at home

Can’t get no job, can you spare a dime?
Just one more hit and I’ll be fine
I swear to God, this’ll be my one last time

In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
When it gets dark in Pigeon Park
Voice in my head will soon be fed
By the vultures, that circle round the dead

In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

I never once thought
I’d ever be caught
Staring at sidewalks
Hiding my track marks
I left my best friends
Or did they just leave me?

In a crooked little town
They were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground

Run away before you drown!
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown!
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves
Fallen leaves on the ground10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She reads a book from across the street
Waiting for someone that she'll never meet
Talk over coffee for an hour or two
She wonders why I'm always in a good mood

Killing time before she struts her stuff
She needs support and I've become the crutch
She'll never know how much she means to me
I'd play the game but I'm the referee

(Surrender) Every word, every thought, every sound
(Surrender) Every touch, every smile, every frown
(Surrender) All the pain we've endured until now
(Surrender) All the hope that I lost you have found
Surrender yourself to me

Even though I know what I'm looking for
She's got a brick wall behind her door
I'd travel time and confess to her
But I'm afraid she'd shoot the messenger

(Surrender) Every word, every thought, every sound
(Surrender) Every touch, every smile, every frown
(Surrender) All the pain we've endured until now
(Surrender) All the hope that I lost you have found
Surrender yourself to me
I think I found a flower in a field of weeds!
I think I found a flower in a field of weeds!
Searching until my hands bleed
This flower don't belong to me
I think I found a flower in a field of weeds!
I think I found a flower in a field of weeds!
Searching until my hands bleed
This flower don't belong to me
This flower don't belong to me
Why can't she belong to me?

Every word, every thought, every sound
Every touch, every smile, every frown
All the pain we've endured until now
All the hope that I lost you have found

(Surrender) Every word, every thought, every sound
(Surrender) Every touch, every smile, every frown
(Surrender) All the pain we've endured until now
(Surrender) All the hope that I lost you have found

Down, let's take it down – raise up their heads on a stake
We will show no mercy on evolution's mistake
Change will have to wait, if we can't decide on a fate
Self-appointed prophets and their doomsday charade
You preach about love and teach about faith
But all your beliefs are still rooted in hate

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees, you just don't look so tall
Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees, you just don't look so tall

Stop, punch in the clock – punch it with all of your rage
Put the man in office for a minimum wage
Rats, fighting for scraps, siphon the gas from your tank
Left your pockets empty, as they laugh to the bank
They speak about trust but make no mistake
They're shaking your hand while they spit in your face

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees, you just don't look so tall
Crosses still burn, axes still fall
And down on your knees, you just don't look so tall
Now, the time is now, we can still turn it around
Raise your voice like a weapon, 'til they fall to the ground
Light, let there be light without a shadow of doubt
We will fight tooth and nail until salvation is found
So how can you look the world in the eyes
When all we can see is corruption and lies

Down on your knees, you don't look so tall
Down on your knees, you don't look so tall
Crackin' the whip on the backs of the poor
We asked you to stop but you still wanted more
The blood on your hands left a trail as you crawl
Down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
Down on your knees, you just don't look so tall
Crosses still burn, axes still fall
Down on your knees, you just don't look so tall
Crosses still burn, axes still fall
Down on your knees, you just don't look so tall

Crosses still burn, axes still fall
Down on your knees, you don't look so tall
Open your eyes and the empire falls10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I stumble through the wreckage, rusted from the rain
There’s nothing left to salvage, no one left to blame
Among the broken mirrors I don’t look the same
I’m rusted from the rain, I’m rusted from the rain

Dissect me ’til my blood runs down into the drain
My bitter heart is pumping oil into my veins
I’m nothing but a tin man, don’t feel any pain
I don’t feel any pain, I don’t feel any pain
I’m rusted from the rain

Go on, crush me like a flower
Rusted from the rain
Come on, strip me of my power
Beat me with your chains
And if I’m the King of cowards
You’re the Queen of pain
I’m rusted from the rain
I’m rusted from the rain

You hung me like a picture, now I’m just a frame
I used to be a lap dog, now I’m just a stray
Shackled in a graveyard, left here to decay
Left here to decay, left here to decay
I’m rusted from the rain
Go on, crush me like a flower
Rusted from the rain
Come on, strip me of my power
Beat me with your chains
And if I’m the King of cowards
You’re the Queen of pain
I’m rusted from the rain
I’m rusted from the rain
I’m rusted from the rain

Go on, crush me like a flower
Rusted from the rain
Come on, strip me of my power
Beat me with your chains
And if I’m the King of cowards
You’re the Queen of pain
I’m rusted from the rain
I’m rusted from the rain
Go on, crush me like a flower
Rusted from the rain
Come on, strip me of my power
Beat me with your chains
And if I’m the King of cowards
You’re the Queen of pain
I’m rusted from the rain
I’m rusted from the rain
Oh, the sun will shine again
I’m rusted from the rain
I’m rusted from the rain
Oh, the sun will shine again

Wherever I go, wherever I go
I have to question the hand that I hold close
Wherever I go, wherever I go
I have to silence the words that you fear most
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go
Are we destined to hit the ground below?
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go
We're at the end of a burning tightrope

Now I'm waiting on the corner in the back of your mind
It's a lonely place to live, and I got nowhere to hide
Cause you told me that you'd never be afraid of heights again
Nobody ever thought that we could make it this high
You're the only one I'd follow 'til the end of time
If we fall, we fall together baby, don't think twice again

Together I know, together I know
That we'd burn like a rocket's afterglow
Together I know, together I know
We could conquer the stars beyond this world
We let it all go, we let it all go
I'm just a voice on a broken radio
We let it all go, we let it all go
We got lost in the constellations
Now I'm waiting on the corner in the back of your mind
It's a lonely place to live, and I got nowhere to hide
Cause you told me that you'd never be afraid of heights again
Nobody ever thought that we could make it this high
You're the only one I'd follow 'til the end of time
If we fall, we fall together baby, don't think twice again
(Don't think twice again again )

And after all of these years, and all of this time
Darling, if I'm still a question in your mind
Well just say the words and this will end
Yeah!

You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights
You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights
You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights again
You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights
You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights
If we fall, we fall together baby, don't think twice again

Wherever I go, wherever I go
I hear your voice on a broken radio
Wherever I go, wherever I go
I know we'll burn like a rocket's afterglow
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go
So are we destined to hit the ground below?
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go
Are we just watching the final chapter close?6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Need more friends with wings
All the angels I know put concrete in my veins
I’d always walk home alone
So I became lifeless just like my telephone

There’s nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There’s nothing to gain
But the days don’t seem to change

Never played truth or dare
I’d have to check my mirror to see if I’m still here
My parents had no clue
That I ate all my lunches alone in the bathroom

There’s nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There’s nothing to gain
But the days don’t seem to change
There’s nothing to lose
My notebook will explain
There’s nothing to gain
And I can’t fight the pain
Teachers said it's just a phase
When I grow up my children will probably do the same
Kids just love to tease
Who'd know it put me underground at seventeen

There’s nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There’s nothing to gain
But the days don’t seem to change
There’s nothing to lose
My notebook will explain
There’s nothing to gain
And I can’t fight the pain

There’s nothing to lose
When no one knows your name!
There’s nothing to lose
My notebook will explain
There’s nothing to lose
When no one knows your name!
There’s nothing to gain
And I just died today11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

A devil in a midnight mass
He preyed behind stained glass
A memory of Sunday class
Resurrected from the past

Hold your breath and count to four
Pinky swears don’t work no more
Footsteps down the hallway floor
Getting closer to my door
I was alive, but now I’m singing…

Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent night for the rest of my life
Violent knight at the edge of your knife
“Forgive me, Father” won’t make it right
Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent night at the edge of your knife
You’re guilty!

A devil in a midnight mass
Killed the boy inside the man
The holy water in his hands
Can never wash away his sins
Hold your breath and count to four
Pinky swears don’t work no more
Put my trust in God that day
Not the man that taught his way
I was alive, but now I’m singing…

Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent night for the rest of my life
Violent knight at the edge of your knife
“Forgive me, Father” won’t make it right
Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent night at the edge of your knife
You’re guilty!

Whisper, whisper, don’t make a sound
Your bed is made, it’s in the ground
Whisper, whisper, don’t make a sound
Your bed is made, it’s in the ground

Whisper, whisper, don’t make a sound!
Your bed is made, it’s in the ground
Whisper, whisper, don’t make a sound!
Your bed is made, it’s in the ground!
Whisper, whisper, don’t make a sound!
Your bed is made, it’s in the ground!
Whisper, whisper, don’t make a sound!
Your bed is made and it’s in the ground!3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Like a target drawn across my chest
She's a bullet in Russian Roulette
You said you'd never turn your back on me (Rescue me! Rescue me!)
Would you stand by me or bury me? (Bury me!)

Why don't we end this lie?

Before it falls to pieces

You tried to leave me blind (This suffering!)

You'll never close my eyes and watch me die

As I get closer, my dreams get farther
I climb that ladder, but you kick it over
Thirsty for water, you give me vinegar
When I drink your medicine, it just makes me sicker

I dug a hole so deep
I’m gonna drown in my mistakes
Can’t even sell my soul
‘Cause it ain’t worth shit to take

I got the devil on my shoulder (Over and over)
And I just can’t sink any lower (Lower and lower)
The hounds of hell are getting closer (Closer and closer)
I got the devil on my shoulder (Over and over)

Follow the rainbow, my lucky omen
There ain’t no pot of gold, just copper tokens
I found the key to life, the lock was broken
All my accomplishments are best left unspoken

I dug a hole so deep
I’m gonna drown in my mistakes
Can’t even sell my soul
‘Cause it ain’t worth shit to take
I got the devil on my shoulder (Over and over)
And I just can’t sink any lower (Lower and lower)
The hounds of hell are getting closer (Closer and closer)
I got the devil on my shoulder (Over and over)


My horror story is nearly over
I said I’m sorry, but I was sober
I beg for mercy from my infernal friend
The one that drops the nails into my coffin

I got the devil on my shoulder..
I got the devil on my shoulder..

I got the devil on my shoulder (Over and over)
And I just can’t sink any lower (Lower and lower)
They got to take me take me over (Closer and closer)
I got the devil on my shoulder (Over and over)1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Blue collar working man

Never understood how she could
Mean so little to so many
Why does she mean everything to me?

Is it worth the pain?
With no one to blame
For all of my insecurities?
How did I ever let you go?

Questioning her good intention
Jealousy’s a bad invention
When you push on glass, it’s bound to break
Even when she was defensive
It just gave me more incentive
The more you squeeze, the more it slips away

I never walked so far on a lonely street
With no one there for me
Is it worth the pain?
With no one to blame
For all of my insecurities?
How did I ever let you go?
Accept this confession
(I’m walking on pins and needles!)
You’re not my possession
(I’m walking on pins and needles!)
My conscience is vicious
(I’m walking on pins and needles!)
And I’m begging forgiveness
(I’m walking on pins and needles!)

I never walked so far on a lonely street
With no one there for me
It took too long to see her in misery
And now it’s clear to me
That it’s worth the pain
Always take the blame
For all your own insecurities
How did I ever let you go?9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Everybody is tired
And poor and sick of trying
If you see me on a corner
Will you stop or will you splash me?

Take a look at what we've become
Nothing more than silhouettes of

So I hold my breath till my heart explodes
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
You can steal my body but you can't steal my soul
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes

Shitty weather, bad timing
Lucky penny glued to the ground
Dirty look from total stranger
Hope you get lost and you're not found

Today I walked down our old street
Past the diner where we’d meet
Now I dine alone in our old seats
The cold wind blows right through my bones
And I feel like I’m getting old
But I wish I was getting old with you

I held your hand when we took shelter from the rain
She laughed as we picked out our children’s names

White sparrows
Fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows
Cut the strings of my heart, I kneel and pray

Her clothes hang in the closet still
The phone sits on the windowsill
And every time it rings it gives me chills
My heart just stopped when I was told
Doctor, doctor, on the phone
Said my love was never coming home
I hold your casket gently, walking to the grave
Dark clouds eclipse, the sun won’t shine again

White sparrows
Fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows
Cut the strings of my heart, I kneel and pray

They gave her one more day
To say the words I couldn’t say
I’m crying in pain
Crying in pain

And I’m not looking for answers
No, I’m not looking for answers
But dear God, why did you choose her?

White sparrows
Fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows
Cut the strings of my heart, I kneel and pray
They gave her one more day
To say the words I couldn’t say
I’m crying in pain
Crying in pain
Our love will remain
I’m crying in pain1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We'll never drink your medicine and we'll never think your way
Masters of broken promises are born to manipulate
Your mind is a vault of prejudice but we see through the door
Your dirty little secrets aren't so secret anymore

We'll never drink your medicine and we'll never think your way
You're tied to an ideology from a book that's out of date
No room for your daft intolerance left in this day and age
We're not gonna go down quietly, we're not gonna be afraid
'Cause under the cloak of sanity's a madman in disguise
Are we blind, blind, blind?

(It's a lie) I believe it but I don't understand
(It's a lie) I feel it coming like the back of the hand
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
(It's a lie) If I think you'll be the one in command
(It's a lie) It'll tear us all apart in the end
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
It's a lie!

We're slamming the doors of democracy on those who are not the same
We're casting the stones at liberty but no one takes the blame
Your cup is full of promise but there's nothing left in mine
Tell me why, why, why?
(It's a lie) I believe it but I don't understand
(It's a lie) I feel it coming like the back of the hand
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
(It's a lie) If I think you'll be the one in command
(It's a lie) It'll tear us all apart in the end
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
(Are we blind?) We'll never make it like a thief in the night
(Are we blind?) Will they cover up the evidence of their crimes?
Are we blind (blind), blind (blind), blind (blind)?
(It's a lie) When they tell me to surrender the fight
(It's a lie) I'll surrender the fight, I'll surrender the fight
It's a lie (lie), lie (lie), lie (lie)

All that I need to survive
Is right in front of my eyes
And I don’t need to be tied
To the edge of your knife
All that I need to survive
Is right in front of my eyes

(It's a lie) I believe it but I don't understand
(It's a lie) I feel it coming like the back of the hand
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
(It's a lie) If I think you'll be the one in command
(It's a lie) It'll tear us all apart in the end
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
(Are we blind?) We'll never make it like a thief in the night
(Are we blind?) Will they cover up the evidence of their crimes?
Are we blind (blind), blind (blind), blind (blind)?
(It's a lie) When they tell me to surrender the fight
(It's a lie) I'll surrender the fight, I'll surrender the fight
It's a lie (lie), lie (lie), lie (lie)
A big fucking lie

They found an empty bottle on her windowsill
The day her mother lost her sleeping pills
She was sick and tired of being invisible
Hard to see in color when you're miserable

Veronika, Saint Veronika
You can't leave this world behind
So be strong enough to hold onto us
We're still right here by your side

No one ever thought that she was capable
And the damage done is irreversible
Now she clings to life inside a hospital
Like she's trapped inside a frozen waterfall
Always said her life was never meant to be
Stuck here living someone else's dream
Well beyond your window there is so much more
Even every prison has a open door

Veronika, Saint Veronika
You can't leave this world behind
So be strong enough to hold onto us
It's just not your time to die
And while the angels sleep
All of the devils are awake
Waiting to steal your love
Right outside of Heaven's gate
And all the sacred hearts
Can't numb the feeling from the pain
Cause when the drugs don't work
You're gonna curse his holy name
Damn God, yeah! God, yeah!
Damn God, yeah! God, yeah!

Veronika, Saint Veronika
You can't leave this world behind
Oh Veronika, Saint Veronika
We're still right here by your side
So be strong enough to hold onto us
You can't leave this world behind
Oh Veronika, Saint Veronika
It's just not your time to die2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Brothers in arms that share my fears
Time to protect what you hold dear
There's been a rise in new ideas
Threatening to change the way we live

Who knows what trouble's found a way?
Found a way to your door today?
Who knows what trouble's on it's way?
On it's way to intimidate?

All I want is a big red gun
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm gonna shoot shoot shoot at the setting sun
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And all I want is a big red gun
I'm gonna shoot shoot shoot 'till the thrill is gone

Cause this is my right no matter the cost
Stay out of my sight when
Baby's got a big red gun!
(Oh yeah yeah yeah-yeah)
Baby's got a big red gun!
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pride is a weapon in your hand
Freedom awards the faithful man
I hear the message loud and clear
Straight from his lips into my ears

And Lord I just can't walk away
Walk away from the enemy
The law will never disagree
On the target of my insecurities

All I want is a big red gun
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm gonna shoot shoot shoot at the setting sun
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And all I want is a big red gun
I'm gonna shoot shoot shoot 'till the thrill is gone

And how many lives will have to be lost
To understand why my
Baby's got a big red gun!
(Baby's got a big red gun)
(Baby's got a big red gun)
(Baby's got a big red gun)
(Baby's got a big red gun)
We call them twisted and deranged
(Baby's got a big red gun!)
But we gave them the keys to annihilate
(Baby's got a big red gun!)
How long before the next one's in the ground?
(Baby's got a big red gun!)
So proud of all your history
(Baby's got a big red gun!)
But history made a big mistake
(Baby's got a big red gun!)
The judge and jury stand before you now

'Cus baby's got a big red gun!
Baby's got a big red gun!
Baby's got a big red gun!
Oh, momma what have I become?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
