I got my first real six string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I shoulda known we'd never get far

But when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Ya, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, ya

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh Yeah!
Back in the summer of '69
Oh!
Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever
Forever, no...

Yeah!

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six string
I think about ya 'n wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me it would last forever
Oh, the way you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69
Uh-huh
It was the summer of '69
Oh yeah
Me and my baby in a 69
Oh! Oh!
It was the summer, summer, summer of 6929EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

When you love someone - You'll do anything
You'll do all the crazy things - That you can't explain
You'll shoot the moon - Put out the sun

You'll deny the truth - Believe a lie
There'll be times that you'll believe - You could really fly
But your lonely nights - Have just begun
When you love someone
When you love someone - You'll feel it deep inside
And nothin else - Could ever change your mind
When you want someone - When you need someone
When you love someone
When you love someone - You'll sacrifice

You'd risk it all - No matter what may come

Sound the bugle now
Play it just for me
As the seasons change
Remember how I used to be
Now I can't go on
I can't even start
I've got nothing left
Just an empty heart
I'm a soldier wounded
So I must give up the fight
There's nothing more for me
Lead me away... or leave me lying here
Sound the bugle now
Tell them I don't care
There's not a road I know
That leads to anywhere
Without a light, I fear that I will
Stumble in the dark
Lay right down, decide not to go on
Then from on high
Somewhere in the distance
There's a voice that calls
Remember who you are
If you lose yourself
Your courage soon will follow
So be strong tonight
Remember who you are
You're a soldier now
Fighting in a battle
To be free once more
That's worth fighting for6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(When you're gone!)

I've been wandering around the house all night
Wondering what the hell to do
Yeah, I'm trying to concentrate but
All I can think of is you

Well, the phone don't ring cause my friends ain't home
I'm tired of being all alone
Got the TV on cause the radio's playing
Songs that remind me of you

Baby, when you're gone
I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on
And the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good
Drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong
Baby, when you're gone
Yeah
I've been driving up and down these streets
Trying to find somewhere to go
Yeah, I'm looking for a familiar face
But there's no one I know

Oh, this is torture, this is pain
It feels like I'm gonna go insane
I hope you're coming back real soon
Cause I don't know what to do

Baby, when you're gone (When you're gone)
I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on (On and on)
And the nights just seem so long

I could start dreamin' but it never ends
As long as you're gone we may as well pretend
I've been dreamin'
Straight from the heart

You say it's easy but who's to say
That we'd be able to keep it this way
But it's easier
Comin' straight from the heart

Oh, give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go - as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart

And all my words would just fall out of line
While we're dreamin'
Straight from the heart

When it's love you give
I'll be a man of good faith
Then in love you'll live
I'll make a stand, I won't break
I'll be the rock you can build on
Be there when you're old
To have and to hold

When there's love inside
I swear I'll always be strong
Then there's a reason why
I'll prove to you we belong
I'll be the wall that protects you
From the wind and the rain
From the hurt and pain

Let's make it all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold, be the one you want
The one you need
Cause when it's all for one, it's one for all
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love
When it's love you make
I'll be the fire in your night
And when it's love you take
I will defend, I will fight
I'll be there when you need me
When honor's at stake
This vow I will make

Let the one you hold, be the one you want
The one you need
Cause when it's all for one, it's one for all
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love

Don't lay our love to rest
Cause we could stand up to the test
We got everything, and more
Then we had planned
More than the rivers that run the land
We've got it all, in our hands
Now it's all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold, be the one you want
The one you need

We shared a special moment
I think you felt it too
I know you wanted more but
Right now this is the best that I can do
If I give it too little too late
How was I to know?
I don't wanna give you up
No, I don't wanna let you go

So please stay
I just need a little time
And a little help to find
All the words to say
Please stay
Before you're walking out the door
I know you want more
So give me one more day
Please stay

You were looking after you
I was looking after me
Sometimes it's hard to know the difference
Between what we want and what we need
I might not settle the right things
But I know the way I feel
So give me one more chance
Maybe we can make this real
Please stay
Don't wanna hear you say goodbye
'Cause there's a million reasons why
We shouldn't let it end this way
Please stay
I don't wanna see you go
I need to let you know
Somethings are hard to say
Please stay

Please stay
Don't wanna walk away
Please stay
We shouldn't let it end this way

That knocks me off my feet
I finally found the one
That makes me feel complete
It started over coffee
We stated out as friends
It's funny how from simple things
The best things begin
This time is different
And it's all because of you
It's better than it's ever been
'Cause we can talk it though
My favorite line was
"Can I call you sometime?"
It's all you had to say
To take my breath away
This is it

Someone to share my life
I finally found the one
To be with every night
'Cause whatever I do
It's just got to be you

Did I keep you waiting?
I didn't mind
I apologize, baby that's fine
I would wait forever just to know you were mine
You know I love your hair
Are you sure it looks right?
I love what you wear
Isn't it too tight?
You're exceptional
I can't wait for the rest of my life

What shall we use
To fill the empty Spaces
Where waves of hunger roar
Shall we set out across this sea of faces
In search of more and more applause
Shall we buy a new guitar
Shall we drive a more powerful car
Shall we work straight through the night
Shall we get into fights
Leave the lights on
Drop bombs
Do tours of the East
Contract diseases
Bury bones
Break up homes
Send flowers by phone
Take to drink
Go to shrinks
Give up meat
Rarely sleep
Keep people as pets
Train dogs
Race rats
Fill the attic with cash
Bury treasure
Store up leisure
But never relax at all

You were born in a small town
Always had dreams bigger than your brother, you know it
Hit the road where it forks down
Made good decisions, start from the gutter, you know it
Big city lives, fast lane living but

You know the time will come
Peace on earth for everyone
And we can live forever in a world where we are free
Let it shine for you and me

The way that the old folks smile
Says that Christmas will never go away
We're all as one tonight
Makes no difference if you're black or white
'cause we can sing together in harmony
I know it's not too late
The world would be a better place
If we can keep the spirit more than one day in the year
Send a message loud and clear
It's the time of year when everyone's together
We'll celebrate here on Christmas day
