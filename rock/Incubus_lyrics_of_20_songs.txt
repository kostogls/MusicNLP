Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty, stinging clear
And I, I can't help but ask myself, how much I let the fear
Take the wheel and steer

It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague
Haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm beginning to find that I
Should be the one behind the wheel

Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there, yeah, ohh

So if I decide to waiver my chance to be
One of the hive
Will I choose water over wine, and hold my own and drive?
Ohh-oh-ohh
It's driven me before, and it seems to be the way
That everyone else gets around
But lately I'm beginning to find that when I
Drive myself my light is found
And whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there, yeah, ohh


Would you choose the water over wine?
Hold the wheel and drive

Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there, yeah, ohh

Pardon me while I burst
Pardon me while I burst

A decade ago, I never thought I would be
At twenty-three on the verge of spontaneous combustion
Woe-is-me
But I guess that it comes with the territory
An ominous landscape of never ending calamity
I need you to hear, I need you to see
That I have had all that I can take
And exploding seems like a definite possibility
To me

So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me... I'll never be the same

Not two days ago, I was having a look
In a book and I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knees
I said, "I can relate," because lately I've been
Thinking of combustication as a welcomed vacation from
The burdens of the planet earth
Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D
But thinking so much differently
So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me... I'll never be the same
Never be the same, yeah
Pardon me while I burst into flames
Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me

So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me... I'll never be the same
Pardon me, never be the same, yeah7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We all have a weakness
But some of ours are easy to identify
Look me in the eye
And ask for forgiveness
We'll make a pact to never speak that word again
Yes, you are my friend

We all have something that digs at us
At least we dig each other (Ah ah, ah ah)
So when weakness turns my ego up
I know you'll count on the me from yesterday (Yesterday)

If I turn into another
Dig me up from under what is covering
The better part of me
Sing this song
Remind me that we'll always have each other
When everything else is gone, oh oh

We all have a sickness
That cleverly attaches and multiplies
No matter how we try
We all have someone that digs at us
At least we dig each other
Ah ah, oh oh
So when sickness turns my ego up
I know you'll act as a clever medicine

If I turn into another
Dig me up from under what is covering
The better part of me
Sing this song (Sing this song)
Remind me that we'll always have each other
When everything else is gone
Oh, each other
When everything else is gone

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

If I turn into another
Dig me up from under what is covering
The better part of me
Sing this song (Sing this song)
Remind me that we'll always have each other
When everything else is gone
Oh, each other (Sing this song)
When everything else is gone
Oh, each other

I dig my toes into the sand
The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket
I lean against the wind, pretend that I am weightless
And in this moment I am happy, happy

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

I lay my head onto the sand
The sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it
I'm counting UFOs, I signal them with my lighter
And in this moment I am happy, happy

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
Wish you were here

Oh yeah, the world's a roller coaster and I am not strapped in
Maybe I should hold with care, but my hands are busy in the air saying
I wish you were here
I wish you were
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

A cloud hangs over this city by the sea
I watch the ships pass and wonder if she might be
Out there and sober as well from loneliness
Please do persist, girl it's time we met and made a mess

I picture your face at the back of my eyes
A fire in the attic, proof of the prize
Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly

A cloud hangs over and mutes my happiness
A thousand ships couldn't sail me back from distress
Wish you were here I'm a wounded satellite
I need you now, put me back together, make me right

I picture your face at the back of my eyes
A fire in the attic, proof of the prize
Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly
I'm calling your name up into the air
Not one of the others could ever compare!
Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly!

Wait, there is a light
There is a fire
Illuminated attic
Fate, or something better
I could care less
Just stay with me a while
Wait, there is a light
There is a fire
De-fragmenting the attic
Fate, or something better
I could care less
Just stay with me a while, oh

Tonight we drink to youth
And holding fast to truth
Don't wanna lose what I had as a boy
My heart still has a beat
But love is now a feat
As common as a cold day in LA

Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?

Love hurts
But sometimes it’s a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive
Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
'Cause without love, I won't survive

I'm fettered and abused
Stand naked and accused
Should I surface this one-man submarine?
I only want the truth
So tonight, we drink to youth
I'll never lose what I had as a boy
Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?

Love hurts
But sometimes it's a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive
Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
'Cause without love, I won't survive
Without love, I won't survive

Love hurts
But sometimes it's a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive
Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
'Cause without love, I won't survive

Love hurts, oh oh, love hurts
Without love I won’t survive
Love hurts, oh, love hurts
Without love I won’t survive9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You are stellar

Meet me in outer space
We could spend the night
Watch the earth come up
I've grown tired of that place
Won't you come with me?
We could start again

How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
It's better than I ever knew

Meet me in outer space
I will hold you close
If you're afraid of heights
I need you to see this place

To see you when I wake up
Is a gift I didn't think could be real
To know that you feel the same as I do
Is a three-fold utopian dream

You do something to me that I can't explain
So would I be out of line if I said I miss you?

I see your picture, I smell your skin on
The empty pillow next to mine
You have only been gone ten days
But already I'm wasting away

I know I'll see you again, whether far or soon
But I need you to know that I care and I miss you5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Better than watching Geller bending silver spoons
Better than witnessing new born nebulas in bloom
She who sees from up high smiles and surely sings
Perspective pries your once weighty eyes and it gives you wings

I haven't felt the way I feel today
In so long it's hard for me to specify
I'm beginning to notice
How much this feels like a waking limb
Pins and needles, nice to know you

Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
To know you

Deeper than the deepest Cousteau would ever go
And higher than the heights of what we often think we know
Blessed she who clearly sees the wood for the trees
To obtain a 'bird's eye' is to turn a blizzard into a breeze
I haven't felt the way I feel today
In so long it's hard for me to specify
I'm beginning to notice
How much this feels like a waking limb
Pins and needles, nice to know you

Goodbye, nice to know you

I'd like to close my eyes, go numb
But there's a cold wind coming from
The top of the highest high-rise today
It's not a breeze cause it blows hard
Yes and it wants me to discard the humanity I know
Watch the warmth blow away

So don't let the world bring you down
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold
Remember why you came and while you're alive
Experience the warmth before you grow old

So do you think I should adhere to that pressing new frontier?
And leave in my wake a trail of fear?
Or should I hold my head up high
And throw a wrench in spokes by
Leaving the air behind me clear?

So don't let the world bring you down
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold
Remember why you came and while you're alive
Experience the warmth before you grow... you grow old
So don't let the world bring you down
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold
Remember why you came and while you're alive
Experience the warmth before you grow old

Bat your eyes girl, be otherworldly
Count your blessings, seduce a stranger
What's so wrong with being happy?
Kudos to those who see through sickness-yea

Over and over and over and over and...
Ooo-ooo

When she woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning
Don't ever let life pass you by

I suggest we learn to love ourselves before it's made illegal
When will we learn? When will we change?
Just in time to see it all fall down
Those left standing, will make millions
Writing books on the way it should have been

When she woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning - warning
Don't ever let life pass you by
Floating in this cosmic Jacuzzi
We are like frogs oblivious to the water starting to boil
No one flinches, we all float face down

If I hadn't assembled myself

Powers that be would have swallowed me up

Until the wind comes
Then you crumble and blow away
If you let them fuck you
There will be no foreplay

Until your ass is blue and gray
