And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't wanna go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later, it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand

Baby's black balloon makes her fly
I almost fell into that hole in your life
And you're not thinking about tomorrow
Cause you were the same as me
But on your knees
A thousand other boys could never reach you
How could I have been the one?
I saw the world spin beneath you
And scatter like ice from the spoon that was your womb

Coming down the world turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
Or are you someone's prayer?

You know the lies they always told you
And the love you never knew
What's the things they never showed you
That swallow the light from the sun inside your room, yeah

Coming down the world turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
Or are you someone's prayer?
And there's no time left for losing
When you stand they fall, yeah

Coming down the world turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
All because I'm
Coming down the year's turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I'll go on and I'll lead you home and
All because I'm
All because I'm
And I'll become
What you became to me9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
***
And even though the moment passed me by
I still can't turn away
'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
Tossed along the way
And letters that you never meant to send
Get lost or thrown away

And now we're grown-up orphans
That never knew their names
We don't belong to no one
That's a shame
You could hide beside me
Maybe for a while
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

Scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are?
You grew up way too fast
And now there's nothing to believe
And reruns all become our history
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

I won't tell 'em your name
I won't tell 'em your name

I think about you all the time
But I don't need the same
It's lonely where you are
Come back down
And I won't tell 'em your name17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Stranger than your sympathy

Who the hell did I think I was?

And all these thoughts you stole from me
And I'm not sure where I belong
And no where's home and I'm all wrong

Broadway's dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway's dark tonight
See the young man sitting in the old man's bar
Waiting for his turn to die

The cowboy kills the rock star
And Friday night's gone too far
The dim light hides the years
On all the faded girls
Forgotten but not gone
You drink it off your mind
You talk about the world like it's someplace that you've been

You see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one
Cause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, around here

Broadway's dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway's dark tonight
See the young man sitting in the old man's bar
Waiting for his turn to die
You choke down all your anger
Forget your only son
You pray to statues when you sober up for fun
Your anger don't impress me
The world slapped in your face
It always rains like hell on the loser's day parade

You see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one
Cause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, around here

When you're thinking you're a joke and nobody's going to listen
To the one small point I know they've been missing around here

A little bit weaker than you used to be

I wander through fiction to look for the truth
Buried beneath all the lies
And I stood at a distance
To feel who you are
Hiding myself in your eyes

And hold on before it's too late
We'll run till we leave this behind
Don't fall just be who you are
It's all that we need in our lives

And the risk that might break you
Is the one that would save
A life you don't live is still lost
So stand on the edge with me
Hold back your fear and see
Nothing is real 'til it's gone


So live like you mean it
Love 'til you feel it
It's all that we need in our lives
So stand on the edge with me
Hold back your fear and see
Nothing is real 'til it's gone

It's all that we need in our lives

You wait, wanting this world
To let you in
And you stand there
A frozen light
In dark and empty streets
You smile hiding behind
A God-given face
But I know you're so much more
Everything they ignore
Is all that I need to see

You're the only one I ever believed in
The answer that could never be found
The moment you decided to let love in
Now I'm banging on the door of an angel
The end of fear is where we begin
The moment we decided to let love in

I wish
Wishing for you to find your way
And I'll hold on for all you need
That's all we need to say
I'll take my chances while
You take your time with
This game you play
But I can't control your soul
You need to let me know
You leaving or you going to stay
You're the only one I ever believed in
The answer that could never be found
The moment you decided to let love in
Now I'm banging on the door of an angel
The end of fear is where we begin
The moment we decided to let love in

There's nothing we can do about
The things we have to do without
The only way to feel again
Is let love in
There's nothing we can do about
The things we have to live without

Come to me with secrets bare
I'll love you more so don't be scared
And when we're old and near the end
We'll go home and start again

I caught you burnin' photographs
Like that could save you from your past
History is like gravity
It holds you down away from me
You and me, we've both got sins
I don't care about where you've been
Don't be sad and don't explain

I may put you on a pedestal
But I'm not your fall from grace
Maybe I enjoy the punishment
Maybe I enjoy the chase
You say you love me in the darkness
But in the day I am denied

Baby, it's alright
You can use me anytime
Baby, it's alright

Of someone you've not forgotten
Of someone who's gone away

And you need someone to catch you
And then you finally figure it out
That it was me that held you hostage
That is was me that held the key
That it was me that made you happy
That it was me that set you free

Baby, it's alright
Use me anytime

When there's no one on your doorstep
When there's no one to deny
When there's no one in the darkness

You always make a scene
You're monochrome, delirious

I want to kick at the machine
That made you piss away your dreams
And tear down your defenses
'Til there's nothing there but me
You're angry when you're beautiful
Your love is such a tease
I'm drowning in your dizzy noise

Ecstasy is all you need
Livin' in the big machine now
Oh, you're so vain
Now your world is way too fast
Nothing's real and nothing lasts
And I'm aware
I'm in love but you don't care
Turn your anger into lust
I'm still here, but you don't trust at all
And I'll be waiting
Love and sex and loneliness
Take what's yours and leave the rest
So I'll survive
God, it's good to be alive

And I'm torn in pieces
I'm blind and waiting for you
My heart is reeling
I'm blind and waiting for you

Still in love with all your sins
Where you stop and I begin
And I'll - I'll be waiting
Living like a house on fire
What you fear is your desire
It's hard to deal
I still love the way you feel
Now this angry little girl
Drowning in this petty world
And I'm, who you run to
Swallow all your bitter pills
That's what makes you beautiful
You're all or not
I don't need what you ain't got
And I'm torn in pieces
I'm blind and waiting for you
My heart is reeling
I'm blind and waiting for you

I'm blind and waiting for you
I'm blind and waiting for you

And you ask me what I want this year
And I try to make this kind and clear
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days
'Cause I don't need boxes wrapped in strings
And designer love and empty things
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days

So take these words
And sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

I need someplace simple where we could live
And something only you can give
And that's faith and trust and peace while we're alive
And the one poor child who saved this world
And there's 10 million more who probably could
If we all just stopped and said a prayer for them

So take these words
And sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again
I wish everyone was loved tonight
And somehow stop this endless fight
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days

So take these words
And sing out loud

I need a family to drive me crazy
Call me out when I'm low and lazy
It won't be perfect, but we'll be fine
'Cause I've got your back, and you've got mine
You got mine

We'll have tiny boxes for memories
Open them up and we'll set them free
There'll be bad days and some hard times
But I'll keep your secrets, if you keep mine

You are the memory that won't ever lapse
When twenty-five years have suddenly passed
Wherever you take me, it's clear I will go
Your love's the one love that I need to know
Your love's the one love that I need to know

Take my picture and then you laugh
'Cause I hate the way I look in photographs
Keep your memories, but don't live the past
I'm looking forward to the best days we will have
You are the memory that won't ever lapse
When twenty-five years have suddenly passed
Wherever you take me, it's clear I will go
Your love's the one love that I need to know
You are the sun in the desolate sky
And your life's in these words and it can't be denied
Wherever you take me, it's clear I will go
Your love's the one love that I need to know
Your love's the one love that I need to know

You can cry away all your complicated memories
That keep you up so many nights
But darling save your apologies
'Cause I know that you're scared, but I swear you'll be alright
I swear you're alright
You're alright

When the answers escape us, when we start to fade
Remember who loved you and the ones who have stayed
'Cause my body will fail, but my soul will go on
So don't you get lonely, I'm right where you are

You are the memory that won't ever lapse
When twenty-five years have suddenly passed
Wherever you take me, it's clear I will go
Your love's the one love that I need to know
You are the sun in the desolate sky

They painted up your secrets
With the lies they told to you
And the least they ever gave you
Was the most you ever knew
And I wonder where these dreams go
When the world gets in your way
What's the point in all this screaming?
No one's listening anyway

Your voice is small and fading
And you're hiding here alone
And your mother loves your father
Cause she's got nowhere to go
And she wonders where these dreams go
Cause the world got in her way
What's the point in ever trying?
Nothing's changing anyway

They press their lips against you
And you love the lies they say
And I tried so hard to reach you
But you're falling anyway
And you know I see right through you
Cause the world gets in your way

There's nothing left to say
You're not supposed to be that way
Did they push you out?
Did they throw you away?
Touch me now and I don't care

Almost human, but I'll never be the same

Is it pain that makes you real?
Cut me off before it kills me

Feeling like a hero, but I can't fly
No, you never crash if you don't try
Took it to the edge, now I know why
Never gonna live if you're too scared to die
Gonna disconnect from the hardwire
Time to raise a flag for the ceasefire
Staring down the hole inside me
Looking in the mirror
Making peace with the enemy

Open up my heart like a shotgun
Blinded by the light of a new sun
Get up, get up, get out and get done
For the first time I feel like someone
Breaking down the walls in my own mind
Keeping my faith for the bad times
Get up, get up, stand like a champion
Take it to the world
Gonna sing it like an anthem
Hey hey-ey-ey (hey)
