Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet
Every roommate kept awake
By every sigh and scream we make
All the feelings that I get
But I still don't miss you yet
Only when I stop to think about it

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

Only when I stop to think about you, I know
Only when you stop to think about me, do you know?

This world will never be what I expected
And if I don't belong, who would have guessed it?
I will not leave alone everything that I own
To make you feel like it's not too late
It's never too late

Even if I say it'll be alright
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
Now and again we try to just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around 'cause it's not too late
It's never too late

No one will ever see the side reflected
And if there's something wrong, who would have guessed it?
And I have left alone everything that I own
To make you feel like it's not too late
It's never too late

Even if I say it'll be alright
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
Now and again we try to just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around 'cause it's not too late
It's never too late
The world we knew won't come back
Time we've lost, can't get it back
Life we had won't be ours again
This world will never be what I expected
And if I don't belong

Even if I say it'll be alright
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
Now and again we try to just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around 'cause it's not too late
It's never too late
Maybe we'll turn it all around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late (It's never too late)
It's not too late
It's never too late45EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I can't escape this hell
So many times I've tried
But I’m still caged inside

Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can’t control myself

So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it’s not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal
(This animal)
(This animal)

I can’t escape myself
(I can’t escape myself)
So many times I’ve lied
(So many times I’ve lied)
But there’s still rage inside

Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can’t control myself
So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it’s not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal I have become
Help me believe it’s not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal

Somebody help me through this nightmare
I can’t control myself
Somebody wake me from this nightmare
I can’t escape this hell

Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

Another night I'm barely holdin' on
One step away from being dead and gone
Am I alive to die another day?
Is this life that I've been livin' all that's meant for me?

Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still survivin', keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

The higher I go, the harder I fall
So I don't look down, I don't look back at all
And when I wish it all would turn to black
I try to see the light and push the darkness back
Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still survivin', I keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain

So if I'm not already too far gone
And if I feel a pulse then I can carry on
When I'm lost and wanna fade away
I tell myself to live, to die another day

Every day I'm just survivin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Even when I feel like dyin'
Keep climbin' the mountain
Every time I think I'm over it
I wake up in the bottom of it all again
I'm still alive and keep climbin'
Keep climbin' the mountain, the mountain9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(From the darkness I see the light in you)

Don't stress, don't stress
No one knows what goes on in our heads, our heads
We are invisible to the rest, the rest
They don't know nothing 'bout what we have, we have

'Cause everyone's living in black and white
But we see each other in a different light

Infra-red
I know that you're burning up for me
Fire in your bloodstream
Moving through you at light-speed
I see you, I see you in infra-red
The heat and the light and the way you move
Like nobody else is in the room
I see you, I see you

It's okay, okay
They won't understand us anyway, no
You and I are on a different wave
So, doesn't even matter what they say
'Cause everyone's living in black and white
But we see each other in a different light

Infra-red
I know that you're burning up for me
Fire in your bloodstream
Moving through you at light-speed
I see you, I see you in infra-red
The heat and the light and the way you move
Like nobody else is in the room
I see you, I see you

Everyone's living in black and white
We see each other in a different light
That's why I look at you like I do
Like nobody else is even in the room
We see each other in a different light

Infra-red
I know that you're burning up for me
Fire in your bloodstream
Moving through you at light-speed
I see you, I see you in infra-red
The heat and the light and the way you move
Like nobody else is in the room
If you fall into me, I fall into you
I see you, I see you

Pain, without love

I don't know what you mean
I don't know what you mean
I don't
Ich weiß nicht, was du meinst

Sometimes I just wanna run away
Run away, run away
I only wanna disappear
Far from here
Away from everyone
Before I come undone
The time has come
The time has come

So here I go
Left, right, left
Right, left, wrong
I don't know where I'm going
But I just keep moving on
Moving on, moving on

I've been thinking about it
Too much doubting
All of these feelings
Too many reasons to run

I put my head down, keep running away from it
Anywhere I'm going can't be worse than this
I need to get away before it pulls me in
And I'm never, ever getting close to anyone again
I put my head down keep running away from it
Anywhere I'm going can't be worse than this
I need to get away before it pulls me in
I'm never, ever getting close to anyone again

On the ground I lay, motionless in pain
I can see my life flashing before my eyes
Did I fall asleep?
Is this all a dream?
Wake me up, I'm living a nightmare

I will not die  (I will not die)
I will survive

I will not die, I'll wait here for you
I feel alive when you're beside me
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying

On this bed I lay, losing everything
I can see my life passing me by
Was it all too much?
Or just not enough?
Wake me up, I'm living a nightmare

I will not die (I will not die)

You know you need a fix when you fall down
You know you need to find a way
To get you through another day
Let me be the one to numb you out
Let me be the one to hold you
Never gonna let you get away

The shoulder you cry on, the dose that you die on

I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
You love me till it's all over, over
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on, the dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer

I know what you want so desperately
You know I'll give you one for free
Forever you're coming back to me
Now I'm gonna give you what you need
Cause I know what you feed on
And what you lean on, and what you lean on

The shoulder you cry on, the dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer

I'm on the outside looking through
I know I'm not the same as you
I'd rather be faceless and ignored
Than be in the in-crowd, desperate for
A way to fit in just a little more

Better off on my own now

Late at night I could hear the crying
I hear it all trying to fall asleep
When all the love around you is dying

How do you stay so strong?
How did you hide it all for so long?
How can I take the pain away?
How can I save?

A fallen angel
In the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel
Close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel

You do it all for my own protection
You make me feel like I'll be okay
Still I have so many questions

How do you stay so strong?
How did you hide it all for so long?
How can I take the pain away?
How can I save?
A fallen angel
In the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel
Close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel
Just let go
You don't have to be alone
Fallen angel
Close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight

I was right beside you when you went to hell and back again
I was right beside you when you went to hell and back again
And I, I couldn't save a fallen angel

Fallen angel
In the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far

Close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight

Just let go
You don't have to be alone

Here's to bein' human
All the pain and sufferin'
There's beauty in the bleedin'
At least you feel somethin'
I wish I knew what it was like
To care enough to carry on
I wish I knew what it was like
To find a place where I belong

But I am machine, I never sleep
I keep my eyes wide open
I am machine, a part of me
Wishes I could just feel somethin'
I am machine, I never sleep
Until I fix what's broken
I am machine, a part of me

Here's to bein' human
Takin' it for granted
The highs and lows of livin'
To getting second chances

Find a place where I belong

We were meant to feel the pain

Wish I could just feel something

Don't know what's going on
Don't know what went wrong
Feels like a hundred years
I still can't believe you're gone, so I'll stay up all night
With these bloodshot eyes
While these walls surround me with the story of our life

I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all
I'm not lying, denying that I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever

Now things are coming clear, and I don't need you here
And in this world around me, I'm glad you disappeared
So I'll stay out all night, get drunk and fuck and fight
Until the morning comes
I'll forget about our life

I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all
I'm not lying, denying
That I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever
First time you screamed at me
I should have made you leave
I should have known it could be so much better
I hope you're missing me
I hope I've made you see that I'm gone forever
And now it’s coming clear that I don't need you here
And in this world around me, I'm glad you disappeared

I can feel the energy, the changes in my chemistry
The atmosphere, the way I breathe
My automatic action is to close my eyes and wander in
And wait until the madness ends
Lost communication with the world outside
I fall into my own, into the abyss

Lost inside my head, I open up the door
Step right off the ledge into the abyss
Nothing that I know, I can't hear what you say
Am I already dead, into the abyss

Looking through distorted eyes
A mirror that I can't recognize
No way out, no exit signs
I try to make myself believe I'm only in a lucid dream
It's like another world exists
I wanna go back into the abyss
