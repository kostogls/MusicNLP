We get some rules to follow
That and this, these and those
No one knows
We get these pills to swallow
How they stick in your throat
Tastes like gold
Oh, what you do to me
No one knows

And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I
And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I

I journey through the desert
Of the mind with no hope
I follow
I drift along the ocean
Dead lifeboat in the sun
End come undone
Pleasantly caving in
I come undone
And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I
And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I

Heaven smiles above me
What a gift here below
But no one knows
A gift that you give to me
No one knows

Gitchy, gitchy, ooh la-la
Do run-run, you won't get far
I'm machine, obsolete
The land of the free lobotomy
I wanna suck, I wanna lick
I wanna cry and I wanna spit
Tears of pleasure, tears of pain
They trickle down your face the same
It's how you look, not how you feel
A city of glass with no heart

If I had a tail, I'd own the night
If I had a tail, I'd swat the flies
(Uh-uh-uh-uh) Yeah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
(Uh-uh-uh-uh) Yeah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Gitchy, gitchy, ooh la-la
Do run-run, you won't get far
Animals in the midnight zone
When you own the world, you're always home
Get your hands dirty, roll up them sleeves
Brainwashed or true believers
Buy flash cars, diamond rings
Expensive holes to bury things
I'm machine, I'm obsolete
In the land of the free immortality
If I had a tail, I'd own the flies
If I had a tail, I'd swat the flies

If I had a tail, I will control the night
If I had a tail, I will control the night

If I had a tail, I will control the night

Calling all comas
Prisoner on the loose; description
The spitting image of me
Except for the heart-shaped hole where the hope runs out

Shock me awake and tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Prisoner of sleep, deeper down
The rabbit hole, never to be found
Again

Where are you hiding, my love?
Cast off like a stone; feelings
Raw and exposed
When I'm out of control
Pieces were stolen from me
Or dare I say, given away
Watching the water give in as I go down the drain
I appear missing now

I go missing, no longer exist
One day, I hope I'm someone you'd miss
Shock me awake, tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper asleep, further down
The rabbit hole, never to be found

It's only falling in love
Because you hit the ground

Dancing on wire, both ends are on fire
Cut me loose
Nowhere to run, no more room to pretend
Wandering along the road in the summer night

I go missing, no longer exist
One day, I hope I'm someone you'd miss

Shock me awake, tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper asleep, further down
The rabbit hole never to be found
(Confide) With my toes on the edge, it's such a lovely view
(Don't cry) I never loved anything until I loved you
(Inside) I'm over the edge, what can I do?
(But shine) I haven't a thing unless I have you
(Confide) With my toes on the edge, it's such a lovely view
(Don't cry) I never loved anything until I loved you
(Inside) I'm over the edge, what can I do?

I sat by the ocean
And drank a potion, baby, to erase you
Face down in the boulevard
Yet, I couldn't face you
There ain't no use in crying
It doesn't change anything
So, baby, what good does it do?
Your friends, they all sympathize
Maybe I don’t need them to

Imagined I'd be your one and only
Instead, I'm the lonely one
You, me and a lie
Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night

There's nowhere to run away
Said, "Boy, if you want love
You'll have to go and find it with someone new
Do you know who you really are
Are you sure it's really you?"
Lies are a funny thing
They slip through your fingertips
Because they never happened to you
Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view
Imagined I'd be your one and only
Instead I'm the lonely one
You, me and a lie
Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night
You, me and a lie
Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night
Into the light, left with nowhere to hide

Closer and closer, we’re crashing ships in the night23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She said, "I'll throw myself away
They're just photos after all"
I can't make you hang around
I can't wash you off my skin
Outside the frame is what we're leaving out
You won't remember anyway

I can go with the flow
Don't say it doesn't matter (With the flow)
Matter anymore
I can go with the flow (I can go)
Do you believe it in your head?

It's so safe to play along
Little soldiers in a row
Falling in and out of love
Something sweet to throw away
I want something good to die for
To make it beautiful to live
I want a new mistake
Lose is more than hesitate
Do you believe it in your head?
I can go with the flow
Don't say it doesn't matter (With the flow)
Matter anymore
I can go with the flow (I can go)

When I first met her she was seventeen
Seventeen
Jump like an arsonist to a perfect match
Burned alive

We run 'til no one could find us
Girl, we outrun everyone

But it doesn't matter now
Just come and love me how
Like the way you used to do
Yeah

Is love mental disease or lucky fever dream?
Fine with either
Gave birth to monsters who will terrorize normalcy, yeah
They'll terrorize

If the world exploded behind us
I never noticed if it done
Let nobody dare confine us
I'll bury anyone who does
But it doesn't matter now
Just come and love me how
Like the way you used to do

Now
The way you used to do

My heart, a ding-a-ling
A puppet on a string
C'est la vie
So lay your hands across my beating heart, love

If the world exploded behind us
I never noticed if it done
Let nobody dare confine us
I'll bury anyone who does

Your heart is like a fortress
You keep your feelings locked away
Is it easier?
Does it make you feel safe?
You wander through the darkness
Of wilderness behind your eyes
I know you’re afraid
But you gotta move on

Every fortress falls
It is not the end
It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and come through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe

I believe I know you
Yet, I don't truly know myself
I pray you won't feel as alone as I have felt
I don't want to fail you so
I tell you the awful truth
Everyone faces darkness on their own
As I have done, so will you

Every fortress falls
It is not the end
It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and go through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine

The Earth spins 'round the sun
And behold
Everything happens
Every night falls prey to sunrise

If your fortress is under siege
You can always run to me
If your fortress is under siege
You can always run
Every fortress falls
It is not the end
It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and go through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine

Come on through

I want God to come
And take me home
'Cause I'm all alone in this crowd
Who are you to me?
Who am I supposed to be?
Not exactly sure anymore
Where's this going to?
Can I follow through?
Or just follow you for a while?

Does anyone ever get this right?
I feel no love

Ain't no confusion here
It is as I've feared
The illusion that you feel is real
To be vulnerable
Is needed most of all
If you intend to truly fall apart

You think the worst of all
Is far behind
The vampire of time and memories
Has died, I've survived
I speak, I breathe
I'm incomplete
I'm alive, hooray
You're wrong again 'cause I feel no love
Does anyone ever get this right?

You wanna know if I know why?
I can't say that I do
Don't understand the evil eye
Or how one becomes two
And I just can't recall what started it all
Or how to begin in the end

Just see how far it will bend
Again and again, again and again

But mostly it's the same

I never lie
To myself tonight
Rose-tinted eyes
Color my sorrow
A shade of wine

Bye-bye, black balloon
See you real soon
Wave bye-bye (Bye-bye)

Oh, why you so sad?
What have they done?
Forget those mindless baboons
They're off playing God
Copycats in cheap suits
Are playing it safe
While cannibals of bad news
Consume a parade

Is it wonderful?
Kalopsia, kalopsia
Kalopsia
Kalopsia, kalopsia
Far, far from shore
The land of nightmares
Gone forever more
And I love you more
Than I can control

I don't even try
Why would I?

Oh, why the long face?
You've got it all wrong
Forget the rat in the race
We'll choke chain them all
Fates favor the ones
Who help themselves
The rest feel the sting of the lash
As they row (As they row)
The boat (The boat)

Chasing, chasing
Dancing, on and on
Chasing, chasing
Dancing, on and on
Chasing, chasing
Dancing, on and on
Chasing, chasing
Dancing, on and on

I was born in the desert, May 17 in '73
When the needle hit the groove
I commence to moving
I was chasing what's calling me

Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
One foot in the gutter
One in the clouds
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on

Life is hard that's why no one survives
I'm much older than I thought I'd be
Feel like a fool, yeah, like a dancing fool, yeah
Footloose and fancy free
Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
Stand in the gutter with my head in the clouds
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on

Push myself, the breaking point
It's all I know to do except for lie
I chase brake lights and dust ad nauseam
Driven by feelings I cannot hide
To be so civilized, one must tell civil lies
On and on and on and on and...

Me and my gang come to bust you loose
We move with an urgency
Between pleasure and agony, on a one-way line
That's the sound that's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's
Time to go, regret it later
We're gon' take it as it comes
Future tense meets middle finger
We take the long way home

Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
Do whatcha gotta do
Oh do it now
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Is there anyone out there?
Or am I walking alone?
When I turned around and found that you'd gone
Before the first rain could fall

It seems every single time I was bleeding
Broken promises that never came true
Well, it ain't so long before the dawn
When the sun is gone, well, so are
Well, so are you

So what's it gonna take
To get you back in bed?
Gossips, frauds, or snakes
They're just our best fairweather friends (Fairweather friends)
Fairweather friends (Fairweather friends)

One day, when we're far away
From everything that hurts
Drink wine and screw is all we'll do
Every day (Yeah)

So what's it gonna take
To get you back in bed?
Gossips, frauds, or snakes
They're just our best fairweather friends (Fairweather friends)
You know the hour's late (You're under blue sky)
Don't let 'em in your head (Fairweather friends) (You're under)

Everyone, it seems
Has somewhere to go
And the faster the world spins
The shorter the lights will glow
And I'm swimming in the night
Chasing down the moon
The deeper in the water
The more I long for you

Most of what you see, my dear
Is purely for show
Because not everything that goes around
Comes back around, you know
Holding on too long is just
A fear of letting go
Because not everything that goes around
Comes back around, you know
One thing that is clear
It's all downhill from here

The love line in your hand
Cleverly disguised
All the promises of stone
Crumble in the light
Most of what you see, my dear
Is worth letting go
Because not everything that goes around
Comes back around, you know
Holding on too long is just
A fear of what to show
Because not everything that goes around
Comes back around, you know
Not everything that goes around
Comes back around, you know
One thing that is clear
It's all downhill from here18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I miss you now, what's come over me?
We're hostages of geography
The wait is long and heavy too
Despite what you're accustomed to
I know that life moves on, that's what scares me so
Have no intentions of letting go
Only us, no one in the world
Only us, no one in the world

I better do something, move earth and sky
And patiently, sweetly, with all of my might
I sing only for you
To the beat of my footsteps in the night

Close your eyes and dream me home
Forever mine, I'll be forever yours
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore

There's no magic bullet, no cure for pain
What's done is done until you do it again
Life in pursuit of a nameless prey
I've been so close, I'm so far away
It's so hard to explain, so easy to feel
I need you now, nothing is real
Save me from the villains of circumstance
Before I lose my place
Close your eyes and dream me home
Forever mine, I'll be forever yours
I'll be forever yours
I'll be forever yours

Ah!
Oh, yeah

It's all in motion, no stoppin' it now
I got nothing to lose and only one way up
I'm burnin' bridges, I destroy the mirage
All visions of collisions, fuckin' bon voyage

It's all smooth sailing
From here on out

I got bruises and hickeys, stitches and scars
Got my own theme music, plays whenever I yawn
Fear is the hand that pulls your strings
A useless toy, pitiful plaything
I'm in flagrante
In every way
Every day

It's all smooth sailing
From here on out
I'm gon' do the damage

Well, God only knows one long vacation
If reason is priceless, there's no reason to pay for it

Make a mountain of a molehill, if, if the molehill is mine

I hypnotize you, ignore, then defy you
I blow my load over the status quo, here we go
I'm a little bit nonchalant when I dance
I'm risking it all-ways, no second chance

It's gonna be smooth sailing
From here on out
I'm gon' do the damage
'Til the damage is done

Well, God only knows, so mind your behavior
Follow prescriptions of your loaded savior

Closed mind
