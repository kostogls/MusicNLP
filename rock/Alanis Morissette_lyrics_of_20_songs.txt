Hey, yeah, yeah
Yeah, ah-ah-ah, yeah

An old man turned ninety-eight
He won the lottery, and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late

And isn't it ironic?
Don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought? It figures

Mr. Play-It-Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down
He thought, "Well, isn't this nice?"
And isn't it ironic?
Don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought? It figures

Well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out
When you think everything's gone wrong
And everything blows up in your face

It's a traffic jam when you're already late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife

And isn't it ironic?
Don't you think?
A little too ironic
And yeah, I really do think
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought? It figures

And yeah, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
And life has a funny, funny way of helping you out
Helping you out39EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I want you to know, that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me?
Would she go down on you in a theatre?
Does she speak eloquently?
And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me
You'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died, but you're still alive

And I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me, Mr. Duplicity?
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
And are you thinkin' of me when you fuck her?
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me
You'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died, but you're still alive

And I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me
And I'm not gonna fade, as soon as you close your eyes
And you know it
And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back
I hope you feel it
Well, can you feel it?

Well, I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
Why I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me

How 'bout getting off of these antibiotics
How 'bout stopping eating when I'm full up
How 'bout them transparent dangling carrots
How 'bout that ever elusive kudo

Thank you India
Thank you terror

Thank you frailty
Thank you consequence
Thank you, thank you silence

How 'bout me enjoying the moment for once
How 'bout how good it feels to finally forgive you
How 'bout grieving it all one at a time

How 'bout not equating death with stopping

First thing that you'll notice is some separation from each other
Yes, it's a lie, we've been believing since time immemorial
There was an apple, there was a snake, there was division
There was a split, there was a conflict in the fabric of life

One became two, and then everyone was out for themselves
Everyone was pitted against each other, conflict ruled the realm
All our devotions and temperaments are pulled from different wells
We seem to easily forget we are made of the same cells

To my boy, all that energy, so vital
Love your hues and your blues in equal measure
Your comings and your goings-away
My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze

Second thing you'll notice is that often we think that there's not enough
It might feel dark, it might feel lonely and you'll wonder why you're here
You'll be overcome with darkness and a sense of hopelessness
But it won't matter if you keep the core connected to the oneness

To my girl, all your innocence and fire
When you reach out, I am here hell or high water
This nest is never going away
My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze
And this cord is unbreakable
This pilot light is there in your pocket
And this bond, beyond unshakable
Even if we all forgot, all at the same time
If we forget at the same time

To my boy, my precious, gentle warrior
To your sweetness and your strength in exploring
May this bond stay with you through all your days
My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze

To my girl, all your innocence and fire
When you reach out, I am here hell or high water
This nest is never going away
My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze

To my boy
(First thing that you'll notice is that everything is temporary)
To my girl
(Next that you might know is that we will always be a family)
To my boy
(My mission is to keep the light in your eyes ablaze)3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

These are the reasons I drink
The reasons I tell everybody I'm fine even though I am not
These are the reasons I overdo it
I have been working since I can remember, since I was single digits
Now, even though I've been busted
I don't know where to draw the line 'cause that groove has gotten so deep

And nothing can give reprieve like they do
Nothing can give a break for this soldier like they do

Here we are
I feel such rapture and my comfort is so strong, oh
One more hit
It feels so helpful in my need for respite, oh

And here are the reasons I eat
Reasons I feel everything so deeply when I'm not medicated
And so that's it, I am buying a Lamborghini
To make up for these habits, to survive this sick industry

Nothing can give reprieve like they do
Nothing can give me a break from this torture like they do
Here we are
I feel such rapture and my comfort is so strong, oh
One more sip
It feels so helpful in my need for some long overdue respite, oh

And these are the reasons I don't even think I would quit
And these are the reasons I can't even see straight
And these are the ones whom I know it so deeply affects
And I am left wondering how I would function without it

Here we are
I feel such rapture and my comfort is so strong, oh
One more rip
I go from one lilypad to another to stay lit, oh32EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I had no choice but to hear you
You stated your case, time and again
I thought about it
You treat me like I'm a princess
I'm not used to liking that
You ask how my day was

You've already won me over
In spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall
Head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you
For all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault

Your love is thick
And it swallowed me whole
You're so much braver
Than I gave you credit for
That's not lip service

You've already won me over
In spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall
Head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you
For all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault
You are the bearer
Of unconditional things
You held your breath
And the door for me
Thanks for your patience


You're the best listener
That I've ever met
You're my best friend
Best friend with benefits
What took me so long
I've never felt this healthy before
I've never wanted something rational
I am aware now, oh
I am aware now

You've already won me over
In spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall
Head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you
For all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault
You've already won me over
In spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall
Head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you

I recommend getting your heart trampled on to anyone
Yeah, oh
I recommend walkin' around naked in your living room
Yeah

Swallow it down (What a jagged little pill)
It feels so good (Swimming in your stomach)
Wait until the dust settles

You live, you learn
You love, you learn
You cry, you learn
You lose, you learn
You bleed, you learn
You scream you learn

I recommend biting off more than you can chew to anyone
I certainly do
I recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at any time
Feel free

Throw it down (The caution blocks you from the wind)
Hold it up (To the rays)
You wait and see when the smoke clears
You live, you learn
You love, you learn
You cry, you learn
You lose, you learn
You bleed, you learn
You scream, you learn

Wear it out (The way a three-year-old would do)
Melt it down (You're gonna have to eventually anyway)
The fire trucks are comin' up around the bend

You live, you learn

Do I stress you out?
My sweater is on backwards and inside out
And you say, "How appropriate!"
I don't wanna dissect everything today
I don't mean to pick you apart, you see
But I can't help it

And there I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off
Slap me with the splintered ruler
And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already
If only I could hunt the hunter

And all I really want is some patience
A way to calm the angry voice
And all I really want is deliverance
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah

Do I wear you out?
You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung out
I'm consumed by the chill of solitary
I'm like Estella
I like to reel it in and then spit it out
I'm frustrated by your apathy
And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land
If only I could meet the maker
And I am fascinated by the spiritual man
I'm humbled by his humble nature, yeah

And what I wouldn't give to find a soulmate
Someone else to catch this drift
And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah

Enough about me, let's talk about you for a minute
Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while
The conflicts, the craziness and the sound of pretenses falling
All around, all around

Why are you so petrified of silence?
Here, can you handle this?
Did you think about your bills, your ex, your deadlines
Or when you think you're gonna die?
Or did you long for the next distraction?

And all I need now is intellectual intercourse
A soul to dig the hole much deeper
And I have no concept of time other than it is flying
If only I could kill the killer
And all I really want is some peace, man
A place to find a common ground
And all I really want is a wavelength
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah
And all I really want is some comfort
A way to get my hands untied
And all I really want is some justice
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah

It's all I really want, some patience
A way to calm me down
And all I really want is deliverance
A place to find a common ground

Like anyone would be
I am flattered by your fascination with me
Like any hot blooded woman
I have simply wanted an object to crave

But you, you're not allowed
You're uninvited
An unfortunate slight

Must be strangely exciting
To watch the stoic squirm
Must be somewhat heartening
To watch shepherd meet shepherd

But you, you're not allowed
You're uninvited
An unfortunate slight

Like any uncharted territory

If it weren't for your maturity, none of this would have happened
If you weren't so wise beyond your years, I would've been able to control myself
If it weren't for my attention, you wouldn't have been successful and if
If it weren't for me, you would never have amounted to very much

Ooh, this could be messy
But you don't seem to mind, and
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

You're essentially an employee and I like you having to depend on me
You're a kind of protégé, and one day, you'll say you learned all you know from me and
And I know you depend on me like a young thing would to a guardian
I know you sexualize me like a young thing would, and I think I like ya

Ooh, this could get messy
But, ooh, you don't seem to mind
Dude, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime
We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I've more than honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

What part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept?
What part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?
What with this distance it seems so obvious?

Just make sure you don't tell on me, especially to members of your family
We best keep this to ourselves and not tell any members of our inner posse
I wish I could tell the world cause you're such a pretty thing when you're done up properly
I might wanna marry you one day, if you watch that weight and keep your firm body

Ooh, this could be messy, and
Ooh, I don't seem to mind
Ooh, don't go telling everybody

This is a life of extremes
Both sides are slippery and enticing
These are my places off the rails
And this, my loose recollection of a falling
I barely remember who I failed
I was just trying to keep it together

This is my first wave of my white flag
This is the sound of me hitting bottom
This, my surrender, if that's what you call it
In the anatomy of my crash

And I keep on smiling
Keep on moving
Can't stand still

Me, the notorious bottom dweller
Me, the ceiling-less brave explorer
Lured to the ends of overwhelm

This is my first wave of the white flag
This is the sound of me hitting bottom
This, my surrender, if that's what I call it
In the anatomy of my crash
And I keep on smiling
Keep on moving
Can't stand still

Such pretty forks in the road
On this continuum I've been bouncing
Life flashing promise before my eyes

This is my first wave of my white flag
This is the sound of me hitting bottom
This, my surrender, if I can bare it
In the anatomy of my crash

And I keep on smiling
Keep on moving
Can't stand still9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You know how us Catholic girls can be
We make up for so much time, a little too late
I never forgot it, confusing as it was
No fun with no guilt feelings
The sinners, the saviors, the loverless priests
I'll see you next Sunday

We all had our reasons to be there
We all had a thing or two to learn
We all needed something to cling to
So we did

I sang Alleluia in the choir (Alleluia)
I confessed my darkest deeds to an envious man
My brothers, they never went blind for what they did
But I may as well have
In the name of the Father, the Skeptic and the Son
I had one more stupid question

We all had our reasons to be there
We all had a thing or two to learn
We all needed something to cling to
So we did
What I learned, I rejected, but I believe again
I will suffer the consequence of this inquisition
If I jump in this fountain, will I be forgiven?

We all had our reasons to be there
We all had a thing or two to learn
We all needed something to cling to
So we did
We all had delusions in our heads
We all had our minds made up for us
We had to believe in something

You took me for a child
You took a long hard look at my ass

Sometimes is never quite enough
If you're flawless, then you'll win my love
Don't forget to win first place
Don't forget to keep that smile on your face

Be a good boy

You've got to measure up

How long before you screw it up?
And how many times do I have to tell you
To hurry up?
With everything I do for you
The least you can do is keep quiet

Be a good girl

As you place the don't disturb sign on the door
You lost your place in line again, what a pity
You never seem to wanna dance anymore

I hear you're counting sheep again, Mary Jane
What's the point of trying to dream anymore
I hear you're losing weight again, Mary Jane
Do you ever wonder who you're losin' it for?

Well, it's full speed, baby

And you're on your way
You're the last great innocent

Worry not about the cars that go by

'Cause it's easy not to
So much easier not to
And what goes around never comes around to you
To you

You like pain, but only if it doesn't hurt too much
And you sit, and you wait, to receive

There's an obvious attraction
To the path of least resistance, in your life
There's an obvious aversion
No amount of my insistence could make you try tonight
'Cause it's easy not to
So much easier not to
And what goes around never comes around to you
To you, to you
To you, to you
To you

There's no love
No money
No thrill anymore

Well, there's an apprehensive naked little trembling boy
With his head in his hands
And there's an underestimated and impatient little girl
Raising her hand

But it's easy not to
So much easier not to
And what goes around never comes around to you
To you, to you

Get up, get up, get up off of it
Get up, get up, get up off of it
Get out, get out of here, enough already
Get up, get up, get up off of it
And wake up4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
