Yeah...... yeah
The good times
When you was a little kid
Playing in the yard, you know

It seems like yesterday I used to play around the way
Those were the good times
Growing up as a child, carefree
Momma said I was wild by three
Even pops showed me love he was there
I remember hanging out playing truth or dare
Cowboys and indians, ring your bell and run
When the only thing we sprayed was water guns
We didn't have much so we made the best of
What we could afford but we had love
Tryna be grown might snick and curse
One TV set gotta cut it on first
Back in the good times and the Jefferson's
When ya next door neighbor was ya best friend
Those are the days I miss and reminisce...
So I steady wish, for the good times

Nothing but the good times on my mind, can I rewind
(I'm thinkin' bout the good times)
The time back to my early days, as children play (On my mind)
On the road to tomorrow (The good times, the good times)
Some passed away
So my future feels hollow (The good times)
I'm thinking back on my history, in my elementary
I wonder do they still remember me?
That little bad ass kid
The boy that wanted someone to help him, but they never did
So off to the office I go, you know
A problem case from the get go
Will I ever change before it's too late?
I need to study harder and get my life straight
Moms and pops praying for the best for me
I was blind and I couldn't see
But they told me friends come and go as you grow
Focus in, play to win, or you will live low
So I tried to do my best, failed every test
My life was becoming a mess
Even though the past years are far behind
They in my mind... considered as a good time

Nothing but the good times on my mind (Good times)
Can I rewind the time (The good times)
Back to my early days (They on my mind)
As children play (On my mind)
On the road to tomorrow (The good times)
Some passed away (Nothin' but the good times)
So my future feels hollow (Yeah)
I remember playing in the street with my little bro
Kickin' it with Mental and Big Kato where you go?
Dizzy D, Big Chip, rest in peace
Nece T and all my other people deceased
Can't let memories slip away
No I ain't okay, cause I haven't seen you today
Nothing but good times, on my mind, can I rewind?
The time back when I used to have a seventy-nine 'Lac
With a black phantom and I bought 'em selling crack
I want 'em back, my teachers Miss Satedon, Miss Nor-ville
Encouraged me, and wished me well
To excel in life, it's a high price
Good advice, summer nights fist fights
Saying, things wouldn't be so bad
If we got the things that we never had

I ain't mad, huh-ha-ha
I'm thinking 'bout the good times
I'm thinking 'bout the good times

Nothing but the good times on my mind
(Hey, that's all on my mind)
Can I rewind The time (The good times)
Back to my early days, as children play
(I'm thinkin' bout the good times)
On the road to tomorrow (You know)
Some passed away (Like when you was a kid)
So my future feels hollow (Runnin' around in the yard)
Nothing but the good times on my mind (Ya momma pickin' you up... School)
Can I rewind The time (Teacher callin' the house)
Back to my early days (You know)
As children play (Chillin' with your next door neighbor)
On the road to tomorrow (Goin' up to the park shootin' balls)
Some passed away (before they was doin' all that bustin and actin nuts)
So my future feels hollow (It was cool though)
Nothing but the good times on my mind (Good times)
Can I rewind the time (Good times)
Back to my early days, as children play
On the road to tomorrow
Some passed away so my future feels hollow1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

*Yawning*
Man... Another day, another day...
Let me get up and do something

Rolled out the bed about eleven past nine
It's about that time for me to incline
Hit the shower took about a half an hour
For me to throw on my clothes I suppose
Slappin' on my khakis and t-shirt not the linen
Low profile cause my Dayton wasn't spinnin' even grinnin'
Callin' Dollaz on my mobile phone
Cause last night he stumbled home, but not alone
Got baked and toasted overdosed on Re-my
Vision me, in the land of no pity
Doin' a hundred through the city swervin'
Baby grabbin' on my thang in the suburban
Turnin', agony and stress into careless therapy
It's true overdue for the century
Could it be no more strugglin', smugglin', sellin' crack
Day dreaming kicking back
Doubt that's really gonna last
Put some in the stash, let time pass, enjoyin' life

Ooohhhoohhhooh
You know? Enjoyin' life
Ooohhhoohhhooh
Nothing else I can do, but enjoy life
Ooohhhoohhhooh
Livin' the life of a boss player
Ooohhhoohhhooh
Scooped the little homies, snowmobiling, jet skiing
Off road vehicles dependin' on the season
Needin' something exotic and sexy
Two piece bikini come undress me
Nasty as you wanna be, sucka free
Let it hang loose when you hangin' with me
Unsolved mysteries on ya body let me find 'em
Fantasy desires don't hide 'em, just come
Let it throb did I get the job done
Doin' it standin' up
Are you having fun?, don't run
Stop, get on top, it's wet, drippin' sweat
And I ain't even hit it yet
No regrets on your mind quali-time
With a floss, from a playa boss
The cost is a question-ing not asked
Just lettin' time pass enjoyin' life....
Ha ha enjoyin' life

Ooohhhoohhhooh
Hey ya, enjoyin' life
Ooohhhoohhhooh
Ooohhhoohhhooh
Ooohhhoohhhooh

Can't fall off I gotta ball till the end playa
Fat crib in the loft at the thug lair
Can't let go, I know they want me livin' low
Ambition competition got me federal been poled
Open doors to a money journey
Conception transgression won't turn me
Mentally composed so I rose to the occasion
A celebration, everyday vacation
Optimism I put in 'em
Give 'em to the kids, love being with 'em
Livin' what I did in the past is in the past, if you ask
Listen my intuition say I'm moving fast
On the gas, of a big, bike sled
All my people say I'm living, past fed
Enemies want me dead
Females calling
Gotta keep ballin'..
Enjoyin' life

Ooohhhoohhhooh
What else can I do, but enjoy life
Ooohhhoohhhooh
Forever ballin', ha hah
Ooohhhoohhhooh
Enjoyin' life
Ooohhhoohhhooh
Livin' the life of a boss playa
Enjoyin' life
Ooohhhoohhhooh
You know, enjoyin' life
Ooohhhoohhhooh
Sucka, and busta free
Ooohhhoohhhooh
Ooohhhoohhhooh
Ooohhhoohhhooh

Intro: Syke
If I die right now there somethings I want to say
Don't plan for the future cause the future is today
Live ya life like ya dying, cause in reality you are
Sometimes sacrificed, but keep praying to the stars
Verse 1:
Stay focused, they say the loc'est will die first
But the calm quiet type seems to be the worst, since birth
Off from the casket to the basket was obituary
To fulfill yo life is necessary, it's scary
That you gotta live to die, why ask why?
I need fortification in this situation passing by
Cryin' inside as I get high, as I ride
Through the Southside wonderin' when I'm gon' die
Fuck a try clock tickin' when ya born
When a baby enter this world we need to mourn
My heart's torn apart from the start
Things are never feelin' right
Runnin' in the night tryna beam up satelite
Shot a kite to that homie feelin' lonely out here
It seems done into things dreams, and nightmares
Trapped in darkness regardless my mind's touched
Ambushed in poverty so life don't matter much
Such envy and misery surroundin' me my destiny
Is to ball outta control
Want a leader follow me on a illest journey searchin' for Yahweh
I'm campaigning for him nigga
I wanna lay in a far deep away seclusion
But I can't get away it's an illusion
I'm falling further into darkness
That's why we heartless
(2x)
Chorus:
Nobody knows what the future holds for you
Don't hesitate do all the things you plan to do
Life's too short, time flies as you grow
I know you don't wanna die
But one day you have to go
(1x)
Verse 2:
Once told time prosperity's not clear, no fear
My prospective can't find it but it's so near, reappear
Cause I'm almost dead steady dodgin' lead
Wanted by the feds, take me dead, feel what I said
Step in this world die forever tryna make it
Make a plan get what you can cause niggas fake it
I had to take it cause I see you can't see me wid it
Searching for greater days, are the ways to get it, shit it's
Gettin' crazy in the land where nobody cares
A ?placebo? in the mist of the night air
Prepare to get yours, open doors to a money journey
Niggas is counterfeit so bullshit don't concern me
Follow me and I'll take you where the Gs hang
Where authentic hogs made it off the street fame
Check game I been and evil mind since '79
Now niggas want me to rewind
On my way out nigga!
Chorus (along wid Syke)
Verse 3:
I know thugs that'll bury ya
I live in a drug area
Outta sight some nights'll get scarier
Drivin' on a murder course, no remorse, can't feel
Even through the pain and sufferin' we keep it real
Let's make a deal I get killed, by a black
If I do, gimme my life back
On the attack mode, ice cold as I dip ghetto block
Blunt in my mouth, hand on my Glock
Poppin' rocks is a past time hobby I take serious
Some disappear it's mysteriously funny
It's about money where I live and stay
But still ain't got here to this day
I wanna lay in a far deep away seclusion
But I can't get away it's an illusion
Nigga prostitution are the drug trade in the States
Like devil case, they all perpetrate
I'm on my way out
Chorus (1x) (w/o Syke)

I wanna lay in a far deep away seclusion
But I can't get away it's an illusion
I'm falling further into darkness
That's why we heartless
(1x)
Chorus ('til fade)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
***
God let Satan rule the earth for a thousand years
That's why so many tears have lost so many peers
And the fear of God should always stay inside of man
But the happiness the devil give you ruled the land
Don't understand who made money, and tell me why I need it
And if it ever take control, you know your soul delete it
I pleaded to God with my heart and mind many times
If you out there God take me from this life of crime
And He took me away just like the Bible say
But the devils playground, is where is I stay and lay
I pray for the unconsecrated tribe that never made it
I know time froze but I hope your soul vindicated
Invaded by demons, and a cesspool of broken wings
It's gonna be heaven on earth bad as it seems
I dream for that day I fiend for that day when God
Come take the devil and his angels all away...

They told me all my life, I better use my mind
But homie all my life, I had to use my nine
Hey, start to get knowledge my nigga
Till' I read the Qur'an, they told me truth was hidden
But I had it in my palm
Hell On Earth, shit Hell gonna be worse
But I can handle all the stress, cause I was raised in the dirt
We got planes hitting buildings, niggas with their millions
They feeding the pulse, so why they flossing it for
Don't tell me God is Jesus (I don't believe that)
There ain't no god, but God, and brother Jesus, is a prophet of God
While you sitting back waiting for Christ to return
I'm on my block, with my Glock, and it's ready to burn
The sad part is most niggas don't believe in God
Until the angel of death come, and it's time to ride
Ain't no repentance after that, and it won't be accepted
Everything you did in your life, will show in your record
Cause after this it's either Hell or Heaven
Ain't no runnin', ain't no felon
Lil' nigga, you going face your Lord
They say if you lived by the gat, you going die by the sword
But down here on earth Lord, we don't have no choice
Little niggas got their gats, and their palms say more
If they want their money, they're going get it
If they have to use force
Now of course I have my loaded semi, waved on my enemy
I'm a bring them Hell On Earth, nigga What You kiddin' me
Islam teach me to ride or die
While I pray to Allah, I keep my loaded forty five(.45)
But I'd rather have peace, but I can't find it on earth
I was stranded and cursed from birth
Amerikkka, why you pointing your finger at me, you need to stop it
Cause Bush rapin' anybody profit, AmerikkkaEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

*laughing*
Shit
Yeah
Yeah
Syke daddy, Syke daddy, above the law
Beam me up, Beam me up
Yeah
The only thing on earth
That can find a satellite nigga
Is a black superman
Above The Law

See I dwell in the land where nobody else could understand
How I feel the need to increase my speed
I keep my shit on potent while I'm floatin' ignoring
Punk motherfuckas, KMG, westcoastin'
Do what I'ma have tos
So you can catch the essence of this black brother
Caught up in the rapture
I bend a corner in the mist, (Straight up)
On the low rider town
Chop a chicken deal wid it
Satellite niggas, all up in ya home town
Cultivatin' and waitin' to put this California grind down
Yeah and it just don't stop
Got that S on my chest
And my five hundred out the shop
Laced wit twenties livin', lovely (Straight up)
Indo to drug me
Beverley rats to rub me
And I think that I'll never go legit
Long as, California keep pushin' that bomb shit
Satellite niggas gotta ball
While the willies lay and pray for our downfall
We slide worldwide, rollin' memorizing
Cookie hungry hoes keep despising

Remember me I got KI's comin' from overseas
Ain't no fleas around these clockin' Gs
From LA to North Carolina you will find a
Satellite nigga big wheeler with all kinda
Rem-edies to kill poverty inflation level
Street degrees O.G.'s, congratulations to several
Thug scholars we honor cause you made it out baller
Street clout, fuck what they talkin' about, shot callers
We need, to kill the greed of the starvin' youth
Substitute game from loot and what you plan to shoot
The stupid niggas get disciplined, but listen when
Incarcerated hated enemies in the state pen
Evil grin on faces all day cases evolve
So they'll never solve, high speed chases
Better paces is near, have no fear in your eyes
Keep praying to the skies for the prize
Satellite niggas

Satellite niggas gotta ball
While the willies lay and pray for our downfall
We slide worldwide, rollin' memorizing
Cookie hungry hoes keep despising
Satellite niggas gotta ball
While the willies lay and pray for our downfall
We slide worldwide, rollin' memorizing
Cookie hungry hoes keep despising
Now I'ma take y'all back like some ole school Parliament shit
Like rollin' Zenith and doin' small time licks
Picture this, I was on the highway
With fifteen chickens in the trunk
Ready to get my ends ready to dump
Do y'all remember when that jeep was thirteen five
When we had just setup shop out Lil Rock
We did the double back flip that shit easy
Then we took some homies up to Detroit
And some down to Tennessee
Cause that's the way it's gotta be
Yo smooth like Goldie
Mack like Billy D
Because satellite niggas come in all shapes and sizes
Big like Willy tall like high risers
Rollin' stretch 5 double Os, pimpin' L-dogs
Blowin' smoke on them 20-inch mo mos
I asked the homies what'll be next
They already pimpin' and fuckin' on the internet
Yo, so keep your game sugar free
Like the black superman satellite nigga O.G. uh
And ya don't stop
Yo, I say, and ya don't quit
Yeah, in this life this
It don't take nuthin' for me to play a bitch
And I'm out.... Syke daddy, Above the Law y'all
Satellite niggas gotta ball
While the willies lay and pray for our downfall
We slide worldwide, rollin' memorizing
Cookie hungry hoes keep despising
Satellite niggas gotta ball
While the willies lay and pray for our downfall
We slide worldwide, rollin' memorizing
Cookie hungry hoes keep despisingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah
Ain't been no love around here for a long time (Talkin' bout thug love)
When the love gon' come back? (Thug Love)
Huh, I don't know, I don't know (Talkin' bout thug)
But till then, keep doing it like I do it (Talkin' bout thug love)
It ain't no love, it ain't no love

From the first day of birth it was like we was cursed
For our destiny to ride away in a hearse
Unseen tomorrows so many hearts are hollow
Can't help 'em they'll put me down if I let 'em
I'm givin' fifty feet to the average friend or foe
And I'll kill you fo' you kill me if you don't know
Cause sometimes God put you in the path to kill
But not if your intentions are to hurt or steal
Constantly surrounded by despisers that's intoxicated
Cause all of us are gang related
Later years fully gettin' there
What do we have here?
One day every family shall shed a tear
I'm lost I can't find myself, I listen but don't learn
What's the call for help will God let me burn?
So I'm takin' everyday like I'm livin' my last
What's the aftermath all I know, is ain't no love
Love don't love nobody (Ain't no love around here)
And love don't love no one (It ain't no love, it ain't no love)
I said love don't love nobody
And love don't love no one
It ain't no love, it ain't no love

Ain't no love fuck the love
See I'ma thug with mad slugs
And trippin' off these hoes up under my rug
Blind and I can't see sometimes
This Remy Martin got me high
Givin' my shit a try
My people doubt me why
Hey, I'm way too fly
Thinkin' everybody down with me until I die
Just like in a nightmare
Straight to fuck from nowhere
Nine's in yo back like you ain't seen jack
Now sticky situations make a motherfucka feel
Like going straight to hell cause at least hell is real
I'm holdin' shit down like a motherfuckin' vet
I'm a real nigga doin' real things, and that you can bet.....

Love don't love nobody
And love don't love no one
I said love don't love nobody
And love don't love no one
It ain't no love, it ain't no love
They say reach in your heart and you will find yo' mind
Everyday in the streets got my foresight blind
My after time is narrow peepin' down the barrel of a four
Just a nigga or a killa I don't know so
Who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest?
Slug in the chest one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
In desperation constantly drinkin' and I can't sleep
Neck deep strugglin' tryin' to survive
Some wanna die I wanna stay alive
Eyes on the prize let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucka duckin' season, gimme the reason
Why I should change into a softy
After livin' so lofty
It cost me my soul outta control in a devil's world
Me my niggas and my girl
It ain't no love

Love don't love nobody (Nobody round here)
And love don't love no one (If it's some love, find me)
I said love don't love nobody (It don't love nobody no)
And love don't love no one
Love don't love nobody (Robbin' and killin' in those streets)
And love don't love no one (What we need is unity, it ain't no love)
I said love don't love nobody (What we need is thug love)
And love don't love no oneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah, this goes out
To all my little shorties, my nephews
My lil homeboy's kids
My big homeboy's kids
And uh, my neutral son Chris man
Little Corey Mack I had to put you in this one man
Cause you know I love you
Verse 1:
Now take little Corey Mack just livin' on the edge
Not a care in the world just a walkin' dead, people said
He wouldn't live past the age ah sixteen
Juvenile delinquent constantly sykin' up to dope fiends
Mean mugging over thuggin' on everybody he knew
Had a down crew tripped out on them to
But the booze started kickin' in he couldn't win
Now eighteen on his way to the state pen
Don't turn ya back on ya friends was in the letters he wrote
His mom going broke on packages and Newports
Time's short and now his terror's on the streets
Big Corey Mack's back trippin' only been a week
At his peak wid his devilish game
His family's tryna keep him tamed
He's tryna build his street fame
He said he can't change or rearrange for the right
Then he didn't come home one night
You tell me what happened...
Now this one, goes out, to my little homegirls
Nelly's daughters and all my lil homegirls daughters
Verse 2:
Now take lil pretty fine Priscilla
Got turned out, chasin' cash and drug dealers
Big willies only leave ya lonely and dissed
Back in the day Priscilla wasn't even like this
She had to insist on being conceited, and flauntin' her looks
Instead ah reachin' her mind in the text book
Many got shook for havin' low budgets and regular cars
No action wid a buck she wants a movie star by far
She's gorgeous and the center of attraction
She wants a football player wid a mansion, the latest fashion
She needs is that the greed is wrong
Her parents gave her morals that were strong, hear me on
How she canived on one girlfriend
Slept wid one's man cause he had a Benz
When will it end and will she ever give up
Now she got five kids livin' life stuck
You tell me what happened...
Verse 3:
Now in life you gotta use what you got
Don't try to plot cause you only get one shot
To get what you can sequence the plan of a realist
Some don't never ever take nuthin' serious
Keep this in mind ya runnin' outta time make a decision
Set goals, have dreams, no matter what position that you in
Play to win, the game is cold
Some givin' up game that ain't need to be told
Suckas fold like money it's funny how bad loves company
Stay true to something
And you will see sunny days
Betta ways are the routes to get out
Can't find a way pray if you ever in doubt
Let you out of the ghetto, hello fool this is real life
Adversity and distress is on the way to paradise
Enticed by expensive things you can't have patience
It'll be there waitin'
Take nothing for granted

Yeah, and that's for sure
Take nothing for granted in life
Everything that you get, betta cherish it
Like it ain't never coming back
Cause it might not come back
So, all the little ones
Just think before ya do something
Cause life's to short, wid no supportEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Part time slanga, one in the chamber for the anger
That you build inside but you never ride
Homicidal tendencies, niggas please
Shakin' fleas, three hundred an' eighty degrees
Trained and schooled by Gs, you can check
Pickin' up my minum, hit 'em, leaving 'em wrecked
Fuck yo set, now I'm older wid bouldgers and birds
Overseas bringin' kis to the su-burbs

No affiliation with nothing on ya resume
Became a rapper now G overnight
Soaking up game like a parasite alright

And killin' everythang on these fuckin' raps, per-haps
We need to throw a meeting in yo hood

Somebody bidded I guess it fitted
I got more style than a lifer on a wave pal
Upside down smiles stayin' thuggin' in the meanwhile
Bustas beware, don't stare I got a evil passion
Thug fashion out of control, ballin' assassin
Let me floss, playa boss, picture me satellite
Kickin' up dust fiends rush, block sold up tight
Syke Capone, roll alone from set to set
Hangin' wid Ninos and gangbangin' vets
Respect the fact pack a Mac if your pocket's flat
I'm puttin' down moves from Jersey to Sac
Felony acts involve murders never solved my brother
Followed around by the federal undercover
They wanna smother a killer
I'm the nigga yo hood hate
Fuck with me and I'll smash yo hood to another state
Call me Syke psychoactive the troublemost
Let's make a toast to the Inglewatts overdose

Outfits shows the center of your character
Split personalities like an actor
Had to backtrack it cause they counter off
Tryna make a thug nigga go soft
Double cross, a hoe if you don't know
Stayin' focused on my cash as I lay low
There he go, the clepto-maniac
And I ain't gon' never change nigga fuck that

Yeah, ain't gon' never change on these niggas

I'm all you will need
I'll feed, ya starvin' passion
At the right speed maxin' without crashin'
Ain't no love like the love I'll show ya
(Yeah I like it), See I told ya?
Believe good things come to those who wait
But now that you got it don't hesitate, my soulmate
I'm searchin' for her through the universe
You will cum first a lot ah pleasure but it's worth it
Every minute, the prize you winnin'
Windows tinted, the corners we bendin', HEY!

Just try it, and you will like it
Treat me right, and I'll keep it tight
Day and night, I think of you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Big Syke daddy, take me away
Somewhere that we can parlay

Baby you don't ever have to ask what I've got or what I'm givin'
It's first class even though I'm thug livin'
Big Syke devoted to the life
Whether Benz or bike doing things you like
Call me satellite baller your girlfriend watcher
In her eyes I see en-vy...
She can wink her eye but ya can best believe
She won't be with me...
I'll be sick, you the flyest and Bonnie of your clique
So when it came to choosin' you the one I had to pick
So stick with me or be history like the rest
Gimme the test so we can chill and release stress
You can tell me your deepest secrets and wildest dreams
And I'll tell you war stories and crazy things
Although it seems I'm too rough
I got enough sense to put it down in the bed I commence
To rinse your troubles in bath bubbles is all we need
Satisfaction guaranteed, you will like

*woman moaning til the end of the song*
Big Syke daddy, take me away (I ain't playin' with you baby, you gon' like this)
Somewhere that we can parlay
Big Syke daddy, take me away (In the Jacuzzi on the road up and down the hall)
Somewhere that we can parlay (Anywhere you want it baby, that's how you gon' get it, I ain't lyin')
Just try it, and you will like it
Treat me right, and I'll keep it tight
Day and night, I think of you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you

Big Syke daddy, take me away
Somewhere that we can parlay

*phone rings*
What's up baby?, what you doing?
I'm just in the kitchen cooking you dinner
Hey?, you know what? I ain't even gon' be able to make it
I got to take care ah some business
What, what the fuck is your problem?
I got to take care ah some business
I'm tired of this shit, I can't believe this shit...

I was so in love with you
Did everything you want me too
Try my best to turn away
The temptation got ya here today
I really wanna let you go
But my mind and body's telling me no
It's at your convenience
So I spend all my time waiting on you
It's at your convenience
So I don't know what to do

Baby I'm bout my money and my family and a woman that stands by me
So don't get upset when you can't find me
Don't tie me down
I'll come around when my business is through
I know you had plans and things for us to do but maybe you
Think I'd rather be some other place maxin'
I'd rather be at your place relaxin'
Can't be no everyday quality time playa
I got bills and things to do so I'll see ya later
With you it's cool I'd be a fool not to get paid
Lay up under you and not pursue what needs to be made
Parlayin' ain't possible responsible for carryin' the weight
Who you lookin' at when the bills late, oh wait
What about the trip you wanna take to the Bahamas?
Ain't gon' be no trip wid all this drama
Ask your momma, about a man always around not wantin' nothing
Got to separate to get something
It's at whose convenience?
It's at your convenience
I spend all my time waiting on you
It's at your convenience
And I don't know what to do
It's at your convenience
I spend all my time waiting on you
It's at your convenience
And I don't know what to do

My girlfriends say I'm crazy
For wantin' to have your baby
I tell 'em money's not the issue
It's all the time that I miss you
I wanna know why ya friends come before me
All the free time you get you ignore me
Breaking dates, you're always late
You're making my love turn into hate
Why does it have to be this way
What happened to forever and a day
I want it all now

So much trouble in the world baby
Can't nobody feel my pain
The strain and pressure in life you had to sacrifice sometime
To stay on point on a thin line
Find the closest denominator to stay together
Whatever choice may be, I'm ready for whatever
Cause I slept alone and been alone many a nights
With no woman, why we argue over petty fights?
Alright I'm feelin' what ya sayin' okay
Remember we did it in the Caddy on the highway
My way, I been used to for a long time
Souls are hard to combine, it takes time
Me and my homies have a bond and a plan
I'm your man, it's just some things you don't understand
Can we work it out and try to find a way?
Or never let it out and go our separate ways?
I don't know, huh-huh, but I can handle it baby....
It's at your convenience
I spend all my time waiting on you
It's at your convenience
And I don't know what to do
It's at your convenience
I spend all my time waiting on you
It's at your convenience
And I don't know what to doEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Damn, the world's so crazy out here
Never know what's going on
Never know why things happen
But they do
Well just take it
Verse 1:
As my inner thoughts of reality set in, another day begins
Cause you never know you were alseep until ya wake up
Will me and my ex-girl make up?
I don't know but life's a question
After death is there a resurrection?
Cause the chaos and the mayhem got me crazy
When will I have my first baby?
But is there love there?, do I really care?
I swear, life ain't fair
So much pain and sorrow
Will I see tomorrow
Make a path for my kids to follow
So it's me against the world
Can't nobody talke to me
I need psychotherapy
Forever I cry inside
I can't hide
Just tell me why
Chorus:
Why do we do the things that we do? (Just tell me why)
Why do we do the things that we do? (Tell me why)
Why do we do the things that we do? (Tell me why)
Why do we do the things that we do?
Verse 2:
A little kid's refelection is a shadow of death
Just behind him are his first steps
But nobody cares it's just everybody for theyself
So pray to Yahweh if you need help
Cause love don't love nobody alone
Can I stay strong? can I move on?
But I gotta get used to my past being my future road
Seldom travelled but never told
The world is crazy my mind is paralyzed
And hypnotized by these walk-bys
Families cry from dead souls lost
I guess our future pays the cost, I wanna floss
But we drownin' in poverty
My homie said he was gonna get wid me but ain't got wid me
It's so hard on a G tryna elevate in the game
And there's no way to escape the pain
Tell me why
Chorus
Verse 3:
So many trials and tribulations
We livin' in desperation
Everyone's givin' up there's no motivation
Organization or self determination
The youth is fallin' and callin' the OGs
Hand up some kis or get degrees, Lord please
I can't take it the world is comin' to an end
So God forgive me for my sin
Cause I ain't never had a thang, will it change?
So I can rearrange
The game ah life is the hardest game yet
Cause nobody knows what's coming up next
No respect, for our elders cause they fightin' us scared
Whta happened to the love we once shared, noone cares
So I soak my pains in Remy Martin and gettin' high
I know that's not the answer
So I ask why?
Chorus
: Syke why everybody die?
: Why the world so crazy?
: Why everybody go to jail?
: Why little kids get kidnapped?
Chorus ('til fade)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah though, it's the M-A-C y'all
Young M-A-C Mall yaknow what I'm sayin'?
From the Five-Tre-Five crew
Str8 Crestsider, (fa sure)
But I'm in the house wid my niggaaa
Big Syke from Thug Life bitch
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
And it's going down like this...

Wasted talent, wasted time, wasted minds
Suckas givin' up without trying
Satisfied with ya grind
Farakhan lacin' soldiers everyday but you blind
Ya best to beware, of this shit called minimum maximum
Cause all the hustlas is catching 'em
From Crestside to L.A
Cutty niggas can't dodge no case
Should dodge the bullet, when it's yo' fade
And I really don't know who bit the mell on the glow
But I fits to get it all before the two triple 0
Like Feddie and Big Row
Hennessy so let's toast for my peo-ples
And all the playas and pard-ners that ain't here
For my factors and my folks wid a million years
Wid no chance to appeal
I know ya thinkin' that it's to real
But playboy this the shit when ya lust for scrill
But if ya get it... huh ya won't look back
Be a certified star with ya own dope track
No tapes and CDs, just zips and Os
And a faulty fan club known as the po-pos
You won't last long
So for ya, grand finale
They ship ya ass off to the, fedaralies
Ya know....
You've got to use what you've got
And do ya best, no time to waste
Don't waste your talent life is full of stress

A one track mind on the street still sellin' yay
Advance and dance to romance the game everyday
Some niggas do sixteen trife bringin' wifes back
My homie caught four kis, body bags, fat sacks
How many 'vances can you get from the fools that you work with?
How many chances you gon' get, from niggas in yo click?
By any means for the greens is necessary
A stack off obituaries, and listen to cemeteries
With a name in the street fame, mo' game
Without the dope game, cocaine, insane
How many lives can I live in this shit
Money spent for ya blueprint laid by the government
Ghetto superstars yard rims made hard
Pullin' ho cards from the block to the boulevard
Checkin' my traps gettin' right wid my paper work
Been in the corner on Daytonas do a little dirt
I lost locs through the City of Angels
At the burial no star spangled
I got a new angle....
You've got to use what you've got
And do ya best, no time to waste
Don't waste your talent life is full of stress
You've got to use what you've got
And do ya best, no time to waste
Don't waste your talent life is full of stress

Every corner I turn, brothers holdin' on
What you waitin' on?, don't postpone, you gotta roll along
Sometimes if ya crew ain't true
Who's catchin' up on things already passed due
Look at Jack big ten quarterback
Now he's on crack he said he can't turn back
How you gonna act when the future slaps you in yo face?
Wish you was in another place, steady pace
Is how I'm going you ain't knowin' how it really is
Givin' drugs to the thugs and the little kids
Smokin' sticks spendin' time barely gettin' by
Didn't even try, to busy gettin' high
World don't owe you, me or nobody else
It's cold for sure, so do for self
Let somebody else wonder and disbelieve
What you could achieve
Don't waste your talent, like Joe
A basketball pro
He'll only be a pro in the ghetto
Cause he prolong, still wrong procrastinated
So many waited, they wasted they talent
You've got to use what you've got
And do ya best, no time to waste
Don't waste your talent life is full of stress
You've got to use what you've got
And do ya best, no time to waste
Don't waste your talent life is full of stressEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

See, time is money, and money is time
I'm goin’ to get mine anywhere I can find
I'm from the sunshine state where the hate don't wait
Ocean breeze, palm trees, and thug disease
Baby, please, I hang around thieves and G’s
So go 'head, squeeze, ain't no need to tease
In the race, I'ma win - let the games begin
Smellin' like skunk, now she drunk off gin
Pretend I'm your boyfriend (My boyfriend?)
Yeah, I'm your boyfriend
I got things I need to do, can't be playin’ with you
If the chips overdue, you’ll be comin' anew
Got two things I don’t waste: money and my time
Playin' with my mind, girl, you're way outta line
My paper on pause just to get them drawers
You know you with a crook, we ain't breakin’ no laws

Time is money, and uh, money is time
You gotta yours, and I, I gotta get mine
You've been, sayin' for days that you're gonna stop by
Like you don't know there's more to this life than tryin' to get high

I do my, I do my thug thizzlemajig
My favorite pistola, my Sig
Sauer, disabler, stapler, wiggle your wig
I fell off in her crib on a good one, mayne
Her crevice so wet, some wanna get with me
I got a bag full of lettuce, bumpin' my favorite slow ballad
Why you procrastinatin' and renegin'? Twist up on salad (Salad)
My eyes just the reddest, I'm twisted, hampered, and high (High)
Diggin' and divin' and lyin' all in them thighs (Thighs)
I said, "What's my name?," she said, "Your majesty"
"How it feel?" "It's all gravity"
Stickin' and movin' and groovin', gettin' her off (Uh-huh)
Doin' it in all of the rooms and all on the couch (Couch)
I come from the soil (Soil), where coffee pots boil (Boil)
Hustlas be handlin' they business, pharmists and chemists (Chemists)
Players be flossin' and coonin', wellin' and timin' (Timin')
Haters be plottin' and schemin', scammin' and tryin' (Tryin')
My time is money (Money), my money is time (Time)
Me and my potnas like it, DJ Quik on the grind (Grind)
Spliffin' and sippin' and perkin', belchin' and burpin' (Burpin')
Spittin' and rhymin' and rappin', sellin' and workin' (Workin')
Time is money, and uh, money is time
You gotta yours, and I, I gotta get mine
You've been, sayin' for days that you're gonna stop by
Like you don't know there's more to this life than tryin' to get high

I saw you walkin' down the street and I had to stop
Turn up that break bad and drop the top
But what's happenin' with your girl and that drank - she gulp it down hard
What you doin' hangin' with that broken-down broad? (I don't know)
Girl, you need to get it while the gettin' is good
And stop lettin' her keep you in the hood, little mama (You right)
'Cause time is money, and we all on the clock
And we ain't no new faces, we've been known on the block
Look at E-40, look at Big Syke (Right)
Look at your boy Quik wheelie on that bike
Yo, we got it sittin' on our tailfeathers? (Nah)
No, we them ghetto postmen tryna mail letters
'Cause ain't nothin' like the sound of them bills
When we fan 'em in your face and it's all our scrill for real
And your homegirl standin' there drinkin'
Makin' you look bad, now tell me what you thinkin'?
Number one, I don't like lint (Good)
Hangin' around nine broke muthafuckas, I'll be the tenth
Number two (What?), stay up on my paper chase, in your face
I'm Witch Hazel, and I ain't got time to waste (Yes)
Time is money, and uh, money is time
You gotta yours, and I, I gotta get mine
You've been, sayin' for days that you're gonna stop by
Like you don't know there's more to this life than tryin' to get high

Big Syke Daddy!
*laughter*  Putos
Y'all better get ready ese for my homeboy Big Syke

I'm high till I die, drunk till I'm gone
Everybody wanna talk but leave me alone
Homie snatched up by the feds, little brothers dead
And all I see is murder and troubled waters ahead
So I'm trapped in pain, cause momma won't stop cryin'
Got nothin' to gain in the game forever tryin'
Will I lose so I choose to be a killa
So when you mention Syke they say, fuck that nigga
But I don't give a fuck I'm drivin' buckets
Stackin' duckets, tryna get my mail
Constantly worried about death in jail
So I'm stayin' high why even try, Glocks to the sky
It's either me or the enemy somebody gonna die
But nobody cares the world is so ungrateful
It ain't fair my woman dropped me after being faithful
I can't take it I smoke a pack a day
It's like I'm goin' cracked away
What you say? It's about them high dollaz

Time's revolvin' can you see the change? (That's what somebody told me)
Never solvin' things will always stay the same (So get yo' money)
Time's revolvin' can you feel the pain? (Ain't nothin' changed)
Never solvin' things will always stay the same
Dear mister president I represent the ghetto
Tell ya wife hello, I'll be brief with this kinda grief
Niggas is locked up set blocked up penitentiary lies
Mo' niggas in jail than baptized
For centuries minority families pockets stay lackin'
Homeless shelters overcrowdin' and you still taxin'
Homies dyin' now who got the clout, not me
You get more time for 5 grams and a half a ki
Blacks poppin' rocks, whites on the powder grind
Yo I don't test mine, rather die than let you see me cry
So I'm lost what's the cost for a crime boss
It depends on the color of the sauce
Democrats Republicans stumblin' to the concrete
Cause they covered by white sheets
Can't compete with you scandalous politicians
So every fuckin' night, I'm on a mission
Highdolla gangbangin'

Time's revolvin' can you (Fool!) See the change? (What else can a nigga do?)
Never solvin' things will always stay the same (I ain't got no 40 million dollar contract, pay an old balla' nothin')
Time's revolvin' can you feel the pain? (Wanna get my chips nigga)
Never solvin' things will always stay the same (Somebody give me a record deal)

Still caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
I'm surrounded by blood and crips, will I trip?
I need money disjunction, show 'em why I can't function
Ain't that something for nothing?
Who in the fuck do I look like?
To go from Little Syke to Big Syke overnight
Bangin' tight since '79 rollin' perimeters
From January to December, can you remember?
Big homies puttin' in work, 6-4s in the dirt
Going body wid your Gs till ya knuckles hurt
In the land of the lost where it cost to bang
So I made it off the street fame fuck the rap game
It's a shame so much pressure and pain
Niggas can't maintain cause on the streets they got busta status
Now you a killin' apparatus nigga come now
Vow to stay a hog till the day I die
While busta niggas wanna try
This highdolla gangbangin'
Time's revolvin' can you see the change?
Never solvin' things will always stay the same
Time's revolvin' can you feel the pain?
Never solvin' things will always stay the sameEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Verse 1:
As I, reminisce about the old days
The OJs, Devon 'n Kase
Bumpin' grindin' in the hallways
Back in school, I broke the rules
I ran wid fools I paid my dues
I do anything to be cool
It's funny how time flies
In the blink of an eye
Ya see years of ya life go passin' by
As I try to maintain
I break the chains
Weed smoke in my brain
Just to ease the pain
I recall it was a black thang, a mack game
Now it's either gangbang or livin' in the crack game
Mercy mercy meeee, not to curse me
Just cause it hurts me
To see my people out ah work doin' dirt
Money comes disperse drain an accountant for what it's worth
Poverty stricken environments
Lead to early retirements
Drugs moved into the ghetto by the government
I'm back by popular demand
A easy hundred grand
Made Marvin Gaye feel like a troubled man
Schemes calculating dreams made on triple beams
So it seems all things is for the green
Verse 2:
It's just the way it's gon' be till I die
This gangsta life, who ride throw up sets
It's for the evil mind
Living our lives sayin' he's a friend of mine
Had these niggas wanna smoke me in the blink of the eye tell me why?
Retaliatin' waitin' in the bushes wid the Calico
Reload and ready to go hit the floor
Ride on young hogs get ya bang on
And make sure you got ya zones
Get ya slang on, ya caine on
It's a meetin' a short greetin'
Nobody's leavin', till we see some body leakin'
Some deady bodies bleedin'
And every place we roll we get a G-stroll
Punks jump up to get beat down and T rowed
(Big Syke)
We commence to smash, get the cash, that's all we wanted
Wid desire expired cause every hood is haunted
By killas and jackers, tryna make it as a street hog
Bustin' out a coupe in the smog....
Verse 3:
As I begin to put 'em in bags
I'm taking drags from the shrimp
Stake that sweat, like a bitch's clit
But I gotta keep it lit
Don't split just take another hit
Man slug to ya fuckin' dome
And now ya spirit and soul
Has got nowhere to fuckin' roam
I be the one that is ready to battle invitin' the one to come try me
Who in the fuck ever said that A-Roc was bad as evil a crimey
And goin' through bottle it harm wid dice bitch to your fuckin' throat
He's dead and he's gone goody bye, so you know that is all he wrote
So bon voyage to those that stand around it's time to break
If not you'll be another fucking victim's life I take
When I was born I came along wid a pair of big ass nuts
I smoking 'em all so fuck the rest of all you rappin' mutts
(Big Syke)
Our future's been dark since little locs in the park
Weak appetites searchin' for a light but none in sight
I know God see a nigga in this turmoil and suspense
Trapped in this gutter residence..
(?????)
Fuck friends and gets my endz is all I know
I can't trust no nigga, so you know I damn so can't trust no hoe
Cash been hard to find since '89, been a steady grind
Always involved, in major crime
(????)
I got a crew that'll rush a chosen few to stay true
Till the end gettin' our revenues and payin' dues
Still tow this money, payback for murdered buddies
Now things is bloody, time to play 'em like putty
Gots to give me my props cause we comes deep
Hard rock lettin the evil mind be known on your street
Verse 4: Big Syke
Cause me and my row dogs everything we did as kids was for the turf
Tryna make it work, and my woman's gettin' her feelings hurt
See that's my row dog and you my row puppy
Not likin' him and sweatin' me's making shit crazy
Hazy days wid penetentiary ways don't make me choose
Cemetary dates, escalate, so you know you lose
I'm cruisin' through chaos, drivin' through hell county
Disappear off the earth, only my row dog can find me
Always on the side of me in danger parlayin' on betta days
To the Oak we'll stay down forever to our dyin' days
I pray to Yahweh every night to lead us right across
Whoever go first, don't let the other get lost
Playaboss is what we call ourself
Soon as we got a taste ah wealth
Now we satelite niggas wid a bigger aresenal on our shelf
Trained and schooled by Gs, death before dishonor
Shakin' fleas, fuck wid these you a goner, my East partner
On my side when we ride in synchronized formation
Making hits, pullin' licks, building our reputation
In the hood from a tiny to a G-hog
Nothing comes closer nigga
Than me and my road dogs1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(Chorus-Samaria)
The angels cried for you, when you fell that day
How can I replay, all the joy you gave
Memories of us, will never fade away
The angels cried for you, when you fell that day
(Verse 1-Moe)
A part of me died, you'd be lyin if you told me that I'd be your right
My soul cried but my eyes had to stay dry
Bein strong for your moms when she ask me why, why
I wondered too but I can't question God's actions
They say it happens for a reason and I should be happy
This wishful thinkin got me feelin like a soul at ease
I hope you got your soul right before you had to leave
If not God forgive him for his sins please
He know not what he did walkin as a deed
But if my prayer's in vain, I sacrifice me
He had a rough life, he need a smooth eternity
You chased for currency it worried me I never said it
The wrong direction was your fate you knew where you was headed
Your presence was a message to me and I can't forget it
We only have one life so you better live it
(Chorus-Samaria)
The angels cried for you, when you fell that day
How can I replay, all the joy you gave
Memories of us, will never fade away
The angels cried for you, when you fell that day
(Verse 2)
(Jelani)
What's supposed to do now
You live for me I live for you because we true pals
Oh what to do now, tried to make it through, how
They took you away and everyday I say who now, or who now
'Cause I know, I'm the last one left
When they took you homie, it's like they took my breath
And I can't stand, villains of my left hand man
Together we had plans now it's never again
Man, I hate that, what is this payback
For everybody that I hurt please don't say that
I pray that, I know where ya at 'cause I can't bring ya back, I can't bring
Ya back
It's a fact and we all done, and we all grunt
And when that day come, we all gon' save up
But why, did they have to take you and not my enemy, I'm holdin on 'till
Ya..
(Java)
Roll with me, full of grief homie disbelief
Can't sleep 'cause my nigga keep on callin me
Memories of ya been straight suited up
Hush puppies, shirt tucked, with ya diamond studs
Was it my love for the music, or was it just me
That kept my nigga from kickin it, spittin at fiends
Males, bad as hell causin drama at school
Broke the rules 'cause we niggas had nothin to lose
Shocked as hell 'cause I was just gon' call
Before my nigga Ken told me you was chillin with God
I feel like I did ya wrong, pullin up ya phone number in my cell phone
How long, will it be before I see you again
You took the highway to heaven like Michael and did
Starin at ya nigga from heaven above
Reunited with your mother so I know it's all good
(Chorus-Samaria)
The angels cried for you, when you fell that day
How can I replay, all the joy you gave
Memories of us, will never fade away
The angels cried for you, when you fell that day
(Verse 3-JU)
I wish I could reach down in the ground and put my arms around you
My tears would started showers and form storms and drown you
I could never forget the day, that I lost ya
Good thing I let you know I love ya, the last time that I talked to ya
I wish that I could wake you up, but I'm glad you restin eternally
Just the fire in my heart from losin you is still burnin me
Turnin me to a man for our journey into a land
Where I be lost if I didn't have you holdin my hand
By my side when I needed you
Wish you would of just picked a time to say, JU I'm leavin you
So I could better be along, you always told me friends surprise ya, just
Take it head on
I guess that's why I could lie so much
And I guess that's why at ya funeral, I broke down and cried so much
My grandma always said you too much like yo granddaddy
I'm tryin hard to be strong, but I miss ya badly
(Chorus-Samaria)
The angels cried for you, when you fell that day
How can I replay, all the joy you gave
Memories of us, will never fade away
The angels cried for you, when you fell that dayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

No suprise, the preacher got you paying tithes?
Do you believe who you believe what he saying enlightens?
Did Jesus rise? Days after his demise?
You’re the paralyzed, the term closed, the open eyes
They’ll may lie
So I ain't paying tithes no more
Eternal life is the prize, don’t cost dough
So the plate being passed around helping who?
The bills paid and the money made helping you?
Mr reverend, Mr preacher, Mr bible-teacher
Is heaven a job the only way for god to reach you?
Say preacher, say pastor, what you really after?
Is it your goal to safe souls for the master?
Dizaster strikes like a thief in the night
The devil got us doing wrong what we think is right
But the light is in the scriptures that the prophets wrote
The false prophets will appear selling false hope

Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you even know? Yo' religion
Jehovah witness, Polytheism and Buddhism
The Islamic, the Catholic and the Judhism
Hinduism, but wheres the wisdom in the scroll?
They translated so many times no one knows
Souls lost, cuz Satan wanna challenge God
That’s crazy Satan got a name why don’t God?
Is it Jahweh, Jehovah or Allah?
Did they take it out the bible like Voila
Scholar’s writ that religion is all (?)
But it’s a mystery like the history of mankind
And they giving out religion everywhere you look..
Joseph Smith and his vision wrote the Mormon book
Is your religion carrying to your lifestyle?
You asked for it or was it passed down as a child?
How in the world could you believe with no research
So the only place I’m going is a free church

Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you even know? Yo' religion
You think it wasn’t Adam? You think it wasn’t Eve?
Did you read that yourself or do you just believe?
The devil deceived, many say he don’t exist
But same inside of you if you prejedice
Can you resist temptation, here’s the nation of the God
The devil trapped on the earth with a murder squad
A fallen angel that choose to oppose the Lord
Say you wasn’t believing nothing that they never saw
So some worship idols, for their soul’s survival
Some of the priests only use pieces of the bible
Some from the old text, some from the new text
And there is even some that marry the same sex
We in the last days looking the evil men do
They say if the messiah was coming, he would’ve came through
But he giving the devil time to finish the crime
So I ain’t worried about your religon or were the Lord mind

Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you really even know? Yo' religion
Tell me do you even know? Yo' religionEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Chorus:
Big Syke daddy, take me away
Somewhere that we can parlay
Big Syke daddy, take me away
Somewhere that we can parlay
Verse 1:
You can be my girl, I'll take you ’round the world, you'll like it
Just call me Syke
Might get a little heated
Warm what's needed
Problems let me treat it
Tell them suckas they can beat it
I’m all you will need
I'll feed ya starvin' passion
At the right speed maxin' without crashin'
Ain't no love like the love I'll show (Yeah I like it)
See I told ya
Believe good things come to those who wait
But now that you got it, don't hesitate, my soulmate
I’m searchin’ for her through the universe
You will cum first a lot, a pleasure but it's worth it
Every minute, the prize you winnin’, windows tinted
The corners we bendin', HEY!
Bridge:
Just try it, and you will like it
Treat me right and I'll keep it tight
Day and night, I think of you
There's nothing that I wouldn’t do for you
Chorus:

Somewhere that we can parlay
Verse 2:
Baby, you ain't gotta ask what I got or what I'm givin'
It's first class even though I'm thug livin'

Call me satellite baller, ya girlfriend watcher
In her eyes I see en-vy....
She can wink her eye but ya best believe
She don't be with me...
I'll be sick, you the flyest and Bonnie, ah, your clique
So when it came to choosin'

So stick with me or be history like the rest
Gimme the test so we can chill and release stress
You can tell me your deepest secrets and wildest dreams
And I'll tell you war stories and crazy things
Although it seems I'm too rough
I got enough sense to put it down in the bed I commence
To rinse your troubles in bath bubbles is all we need
Satisfaction guaranteed, you will like

It's the road dog to 2Pac, back on the block
And the only reason they got it locked, 'cause we stopped
Now some say they changed the game
But it's the same in L.A. where we ball and bang
Ain't no thang, I had a ball when Pac was on the row
You should know a lot of cowards glad to see ya go
But I don't know 'em from the West and I'm born and raised
On purple haze where we bangin' cradle to the grave
A hood slave in the middle of the killing fields, it's all real
Now everybody wanna know, how I feel
About everybody over thuggin' and mean muggin'
But that was Makaveli playin' thought it wasn't?
So don't you try to look at me as a 
I'm a thug life O.G. and straight rider
When you head west, leave your vest and you're stressed
You got nice ice doin' your best, yes
Hey, hey, hey. hey. hey, hey, hey. hey
Hey, hey, hey. hey. hey
Hey, hey, hey. hey. hey, hey, hey. hey

I was born to ball on your hooks 'cause I'm a crook
Here's a real deal so take a look, and get shook
Like a earthquake when I shake, I stay baked
What you really hate is not your fate, you cupcake
You wanna see me livin' on the edge or in the feds
Or you probably wanna see me dead, I'm dumpin' lead
On you cowards and you dream killers 'til you feel us
And you'll never find out who the real is 'til you kill us
Like my women fine with a mind of her own
That don't call me all the time on the phone
I love to play everyday but no way
'Cause the day I go broke is the day she go away
And brothers gettin' rollin' eyes with snow bunnies
Sister would you realize it ain't the money
Just let him be and you will see, he free
Be satisfied that you got a thug like me goin'
Hey, hey, hey. hey. hey, hey, hey. hey
Hey, hey, hey. hey. hey
Hey, hey, hey. hey. hey, hey, hey. hey
Hey, hey, hey. hey. hey

I love ladies from L.A out the hood
I would let everybody play if I could
I remember back in high school, I was a fool
The hood taught me how to bang and act a fool
But I was swingin' through Crenshaw and Fairfax
Westchester Hamilton, where you at?
Morningside  you see me
In the parkin' line humpin' bump ya hotty
Hawthorne and Washington, on your campus
Losing at Jefferson who's the baddest?
Jordan to  on imperial
Bangin' my stereo, you don't feel me though
Saint Mary's to the Michaels' add the tight ho's
You know how life goes, made me psycho
And I'm still tryna find the way out of me
I'm at U-C-L-A and U-S-C goin'
Hey, hey, hey. hey. hey, hey, hey. hey
Hey, hey, hey. hey. hey
Hey, hey, hey. hey. hey, hey, hey. hey
Hey, hey, hey. hey. hey

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey now
Big Femi up in the house
Thug Life Outlawz, still breathin'
West Coast style, born and raised
From the cradle to the grave
Hey, hey, hey. hey. hey, hey, hey. hey
Hey, hey, hey. hey. hey
