Little black submarines
Operator, please put me back on the line
Told my girl I'd be back
Operator, please
This is wreckin' my mind

Oh, can it be?
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows that a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind

Pick you up, let you down
When I wanna go to a place I can hide
You know me, I had plans
But they just disappeared to the back of my mind

Oh, can it be?
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows that a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind
Treasure maps, fallen trees
Operator, please call me back when it's time
Stolen friends and disease
Operator, please patch me back to my mind

Oh, can it be?
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows that a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind

I wanted love, I needed love
Most of all, most of all
Someone said true love was dead
And I'm bound to fall, bound to fall for you
Oh, what can I do? Yeah

Take my badge but my heart remains
Lovin' you, baby child
Tighten up on your reins
You are runnin' wild, runnin' wild, it's true

Sick for days in so many ways
I'm achin' now, I'm achin' now
It's times like these I need relief
Please show me how, oh show me how to get right
Yeah, it's out of sight

When I was young and movin' fast
Nothin' slowed me down, oh, slowed me down
Now I let the others pass, I've come around
Oh come around, 'cause I've found
Livin' just to keep goin'
Goin' just to be sane
All the while not knowin'

Acting right is so routine
Fever let me live a dream
Fever I'm a slave to
No one misbehave too
Fever that misunderstood
Wouldn't leave you if I could

Fever cause I'm breaking
Fever got me aching
Fever, why don't you explain?
Break it down again
Fever got me guilty
Just go ahead and kill me
Fever, why don't you explain?
Break it down again

Fever, can you hear me?

You shook me like I never been
Now show me how to live again
It used to be a blessing
But fever's got me stressing
Realize I am to blame
But fever let me play the game

Woo!

Out on a limb in the wind of a hurricane
Down at the bar like a star in the howlin' rain

Nobody to love you
Nobody to care
If you die, nobody will hug you
No one to answer your prayer

You get low (Low) like a valley
Then high (High) like a bird in the sky
You get low (Low) 'cause you're angry
Low, high, high, low

One at a time, get in line for the masquerade
Drink 'til you cry and you're lyin' in the mess you made

Nobody to love you
Nobody to care
Nobody to drug you
No one to hold back your hair
You get low (Low) like a valley
Then high (High) like a bird in the sky
You get low (Low) 'cause you're angry
Low, high, high, low


Ah
Woo! Woo!

I got paid, then I was on the road
In a heartbeat, Mama said Mama said
You got a one track mind, but you ain't gonna get it all the time
She wasn't lyin'

I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone

My last dime, got used up
On gasoline, know what I mean, what I mean
Atlanta, GA by the end of the day
No other way, that's what I say

I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone

And everything I had to say
Wish we'd gone so far away
Well now I
Can't stay
Blacktop, I can't stop
For no one, it's no fun, no fun
With a one track mind if you don't get lucky some time
But still I'm tryin'

I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo

Can't explain, nor can I contain
Control, you have on my soul
'Cause all I do is, baby, dream of you
I'm fallin' down, when you're around

You're the only one, you're the only one
I'm so wrapped up in a daze
Hopin' this is just a phase
But when all is said and done
I know you are still the one
You're the only one, you're the only one
Cupid's bow, it stung
Now you're the only one

Mystery is what this is to me
I'm givin' up, I'm having no luck
Like a ghost, the one that I love most
She disappears when I get near

You're the only one, you're the only one
I'm so wrapped up in a daze
Hopin' this is just a phase
But when all is said and done

When I hear them use your name
I get all choked up inside
It's not only from the shame
It's like 10 different lovers died
Except you're still just a mile away
But there's nothing left to say

Don't leave us down and out again
Cause we might break instead of bend
I felt a little stain in the pouring rain
It washed away almost everything

If I found another love
They must be forever true
Cause if someone breaks this heart
Your old man right here is through
Heaven just seems so far away
When there's nothing left to say

Don't leave us down and out again
Cause we might break instead of bend
I felt a little stain in the pouring rain
It washed away almost everything
Don't leave us down and out again
The little girl can't comprehend
She had another dream that her mama's gone
She's alright, but you're all wrong

Don't leave us down and out again

Well the look on the cake it ain't
It ain't always the taste
My ex-girl she had such a
Such a beautiful face
I wanted love
But not for myself
But for the girl so she could
So she could love herself

Oh my next girl
Will be nothing like my ex-girl
I made mistakes back then
I will never do it again
Oh my next girl
She will be nothing like my ex-girl
It was a painful dance
Now I got a second chance

Oh her beautiful face and her
And her wicked ways
And I am paying for her beautiful face every day
All that work over
Over so much time if I
If I think too hard I might lose my mind
Oh my next girl
Will be nothing like my ex-girl
I made mistakes back then
I will never do it again

She will be nothing like my ex-girl

My gears they grind
More each day
And I feel like
They are going to grind away
And the city blocks
They drive me wild
They're never ending
Mile after mile

I just don't know what to do
I am too afraid to love you

It's heaven on earth
It's in her embrace
Her gentle touch
And her smilin' face
I am just one wishin'
That I was a pair
With someone
Oh somewhere
I just don't know what to do
I am too afraid to love you

All those sleepless nights
And all those wasted days
I wish loneliness would leave me
But I think it's here to stay
What more can I do
'Cause I'm wringin' myself dry
And I cannot afford to lose
One more teardrop from my eye
Whoa

I'm too afraid

In the dead of the night I start to lose control
But I still carry the weight like I've always done before
It gets so heavy at times but what more can I do?
I got to stay on track just like Pops told me to

I really don't think you know
There could be Hell below...below
I really do hope you know
There could be Hell below...below

When the music is done and all the lights are low
I will remember the times when love would really glow
Like a dream I had before my world turned blue
When the light inside would only shine for you

I really don't think you know
There could be Hell below...below

There could be Hell below...below

Do you feel like you're the only one living on a prayer?
Have you ever tried to love someone who wasn't even there?

No one really knows
Where it goes from here
But we all decompose
And slowly disappear

If evil lays its hands on me
Shine a little light on my soul
Show me things I cannot see
Shine a little light on my soul

Go to places that you used to go
But they don't feel the same
See the faces that you used to know
But they forget your name

No one really knows
Where it goes from here
But we all decompose
And slowly disappear
If evil lays its hands on me
Shine a little light on my soul
Show me things I cannot see
Shine a little light on my soul

If evil lays its hands on me
Shine a little light on my soul
I'm waiting, praying, patiently
Shine a little light on my soul1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Tell me where you're going
What is goin' wrong
I felt you leaving
Before you'd even gone
Hold me now or never, ever
Hold me again
No more talk could take me from this
Pain I'm in
Pain I'm in

See the moonlight shining
On your window pane
See it leave you
As faithful as it came
Please yourself
So you don't have to be afraid
Make amends
Or carry on another way
Another way

Tell me what you were thinking
To treat somebody so
The care he took
The lengths to which he'd go
The coals are hot
To walk across without your shoes
But in the end
Know that you've got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Runs to meet his maker
A drop dead sprint from the day he's born
Straight into his maker's arms

And my blade is sharp
A bad combination
In the dark
If I kill a man
In the first degree
Baby would you
Flee with me?

Pour me down the drain, I disappear
Like every honest thing I used to hear

Like every lover hovers in my mind
We made our mark when we were in our prime
The house it burned, but nothing there was mine
We had it all when we were in our prime

Every now and then I see your face from way back when and I explode
Friends no longer egg me on, they bullshit serenade me like it's gold, how then we're told
I'm praying for some laughter, maybe joy forever after till I die
I'm hungry for a change, I got my fill of other's pain, I realized
Opened my eyes

Like every lover hovers in my mind
We made our mark when we were in our prime
The house it burned, but nothing there was mine
We had it all when we were in our prime

Well, he ran around late at night
Holding hands and making light
Of everything that came before
But there she was behind the door

She hit them with her ten cent pistol
Because they ruined her name
Well, she hit them with her ten cent pistol
And they've never been the same

There is nothing worse in this world
Than payback from a jealous girl
The laws of man they don't apply
When blood gets in a woman's eye

She hit them with her ten cent pistol
Because they ruined her name
Well, she hit them with her ten cent pistol
And they've never been the same

Stars did fall, thunder rolled
Bugs crawled back, in their holes
The couple screamed, but it was far too late
A jealous heart, did retaliate
She hit them with her ten cent pistol
Because they ruined her name
Well, she hit them with her ten cent pistol
And they've never been the same3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
