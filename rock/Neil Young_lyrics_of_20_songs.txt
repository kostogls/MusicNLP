Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were

Old man, look at my life
Twenty-four, and there's so much more
Live alone in a paradise
That makes me think of two
Love lost, such a cost
Give me things that don't get lost
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Rolling home to you

Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true

Lullabies, look in your eyes
Run around the same old town
Doesn't mean that much to me
To mean that much to you
I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past
But I'm all alone at last
Rolling home to you
Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true

Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Come a little bit closer
Hear what I have to say
Just like children sleeping
We could dream this night away
But there's a full moon rising
Let's go dancing in the light
We know where the music's playing
Let's go out and feel the night

Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon

When we were strangers
I watched you from afar
When we were lovers
I loved you with all my heart
But now it's getting late
And the moon is climbing high
I want to celebrate
See it shining in your eye
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon


Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I want to live, I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give

That keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old


I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line

That keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
You keep me searchin' and I'm growing old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
I've been a miner for a heart of gold21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Tin soldiers and Nixon coming
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drumming
Four dead in Ohio

Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her
And found her dead on the ground
How can you run when you know?

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

My my, hey hey
Rock and roll is here to stay
It's better to burn out than to fade away
My my, hey hey

Out of the blue and into the black
They give you this, but you pay for that
An' once you're gone you can never come back
When you're out of the blue and into the black

The king is gone, but he's not forgotten
This is the story of a Johnny Rotten
It's better to burn out than it is to rust
The king is gone, but he's not forgotten

Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture than meets the eye
Hey hey, my my

Hey hey, my my15EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Southern man better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man

I saw cotton and I saw black
Tall white mansions and little shacks
Southern man, when will you pay them back?
I heard screaming and bullwhips cracking
How long? How long?

Southern man better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man

Lily Belle, your hair is golden brown
I've seen your black man coming 'round
Swear by God, I'm gonna cut him down!
I heard screaming and bullwhips cracking
How long? How long?4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

There’s colors on the street
Red, white, and blue
People shuffling their feet
People sleeping in their shoes
There’s a warning sign on the road ahead
There’s a lot of people saying we’d be better off dead
Don’t feel like Satan, but I am to them
So I try to forget it any way I can

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
There's an old street light
Near a garbage can
Now she put the kid away and she’s gone to get a hit
She hates her life and what she’s done to it
There’s one more kid that’ll never go to school
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world


We got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler machine gun hand
We've got department stores and toilet paper
Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world


Keep on rockin' in the free world6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Oh, Alabama
The devil fools
With the best laid plan
Swing low, Alabama
You got the spare change
You got to feel strange
And now, the moment
Is all that it meant

Alabama
You got the weight on your shoulders
That's breaking your back
Your Cadillac
Has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track

Oh, Alabama
Banjos playing through the broken glass
Windows, down in Alabama
See the old folks
Tied in white robes
Hear the banjo
Don't it take you down home?

Alabama
You got the weight on your shoulders
That's breaking your back
Your Cadillac
Has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track

Oh, Alabama
Can I see you and shake your hand?
Make friends down in Alabama
I'm from a new land
I come to you and see all this ruin
What are you doing, Alabama?
You got the rest of the Union
To help you along
What's going wrong?3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I caught you knockin' at my cellar door
I love you, baby, can I have some more?
Ooh, ooh, the damage done

I hit the city and I lost my band
I watched the needle take another man
Gone, gone, the damage done

I sing the song, because I love the man
I know that some of you don't understand
Milk-blood to keep from running out

I've seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
But every junkie's like a settin' sun5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor comin'
Sayin' something about a queen
There were peasants singin' and drummers drummin'
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the 1970s
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the 1970s

I was lyin' in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eyes
I was hopin' for replacement
When the sun burst though the sky
There was a band playin' in my head
And I felt like getting high
I was thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie
Thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie

Well, I dreamed I saw the silver space ships flyin'
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children cryin' and colors flyin'
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loadin' had begun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
To a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
To a new home6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Did I see you down in a young girl's town
With your mother in so much pain?
I was almost there at the top of the stairs
With her screamin' in the rain

Did she wake you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man

Did I see you walking with the boys?
Though it was not hand in hand
And was some black face in a lonely place
When you could understand?

Did she wake you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man

Will I see you give more than I can take?
Will I only harvest some?
As the days fly past, will we lose our grasp?
Or fuse it in the sun?
Did she wake you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup

When you were young and on your own
How did it feel to be alone?
I was always thinking of games that I was playing
Trying to make the best of my time

But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart?

I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
Someone should call him and see if he can come out
Try to lose the down that he's found

But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart?

I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart

Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

It's so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad

Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

There's a girl just down the aisle
Oh to turn and see her smile
You can hear the words she wrote
As you read the hidden note
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

Now you're underneath the stairs
And you're giving back some glares
To the people who you met
And it's your first cigarette

Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

Now you say you're leaving home
Because you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin' out it's real?
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain

Think I'll pack it in
And buy a pick-up
Take it down to "L.A."
Find a place to call my own
And try to fix up
Start a brand new day

The woman I'm thinking of
She loved me all up
But I'm so down today
She's so fine, she's in my mind
I hear her calling

See the lonely boy
Out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Can't relate to joy
He tries to speak and
Can't begin to say


She got pictures on the wall
They make me look up
From her big brass bed
Now I'm running down the road
Trying to stay up
Somewhere in her head
The woman I'm thinking of
She loved me all up
But I'm so down today
She's so fine, she's in my mind
I hear her calling

See the lonely boy
Out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Can't relate to joy
He tries to speak and
Can't begin to say

Old man lying by the side of the road
With the lorries rolling by
Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load
And the buildings scrape the sky
Cold wind ripping down the alley at dawn
And the morning paper flies
Dead man lying by the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

Blind man running through the light of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down to the river of sight
And you can really understand
Red lights flashing through the window in the rain
Can you hear the sirens moan?
White cane lying in a gutter in the lane
If you're walking home alone
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Sailin' hardships through broken harbors
Out on the waves in the night
Still the searcher must ride the dark horse
Racing alone in his fright

Tell me why
Tell me why

Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay but young enough to sell?

Tell me lies later, come and see me
I'll be around for a while
I am lonely but you can free me
All in the way that you smile

Tell me why
Tell me why

Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay, but young enough to sell?

Hello, cowgirl in the sand (Hello, cowgirl in the sand)
Is this place at your command?
Can I stay here for a while?
Can I see your sweet, sweet smile?

Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you
That makes you want to play this game

Hello, ruby in the dust
Has your band begun to rust?
After all the sin we've had
I was hoping that we'd turn bad

Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?

That makes you want to play this game

Hello, woman of my dreams
This is not the way it seems
Purple words on a grey background

The world is turnin'
I hope it don't turn away
The world is turnin'
I hope it don't turn away
All my pictures are fallin'
From the wall where I placed them yesterday
The world is turnin'
I hope it don't turn away

I need a crowd of people
But I can't face them day-to-day
I need a crowd of people
But I can't face 'em day-to-day
Though my problems are meaningless
That don't make them go away

She used to work in a diner
Never saw a woman look finer
I used to order just to watch her float across the floor
She grew up in a small town
Never put her roots down
Daddy always kept moving so she did too

Somewhere on a desert highway
She rides a Harley-Davidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
She's been running half her life
The chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathes

You know it ain't easy
You got to hold on
She was an unknown legend in her time
Now she's dressing two kids
Looking for a magic kiss
She gets the faraway look in her eyes

Somewhere on a desert highway
She rides a Harley-Davidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
She's been running half her life
The chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathes

Somewhere on a desert highway

I got to bet
That your old man
Became fascinated
With his own plan
Turned you loose
Your mama too
There wasn't a thing
That you could do
But I got faith in you
It's a razor love
That cuts clean through
I got faith in you
It's a razor love
That cuts clean through

You really made my day
With the little things you say

Looking through
The window at a silhouette
Trying to find something
I can't find yet
Imagination is my best friend
Got to look out for
The greedy hand, greedy hand
Make a living like a rolling stone
On the road
There's no place like home
Silhouettes on the window
Who was it made
Your eyes flicker like that
Tell me baby
How'd you get the knack
You came to me with open arms
And I really
Took you down the track
Now all I've got for you
Is the kind of love
That cuts clean through
All I got for you is razor love
It cuts clean through
