By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is, no

(Woohoo!) When I feel heavy metal
(Woohoo!) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woohoo!) Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet you

When I was young
It's not my problem

Streets like a jungle
So call the police
Following the herd
Down to Greece
On holiday
Love in the '90s
Is paranoid
On sunny beaches
Take your chances
Looking for

Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love

Avoiding all work
'Cause there's none available
Like battery thinkers
Count your thoughts
On one, two, three, four, five fingers
Nothing is wasted
Only reproduced
You get nasty blisters

Confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur of what is known as (Parklife!)
And morning soup can be avoided if you take a route straight through what is known as (Parklife!)
John's got brewer's droop, he gets intimidated by the dirty pigeons, they love a bit of it (Parklife!)
Who's that gut lord marching? You should cut down on your pork life mate, get some exercise

All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their parklife
Know what I mean?

I get up when I want, except on Wednesdays when I get rudely awakened by the dustmen (Parklife!)
I put my trousers on, have a cup of tea and I think about leaving me house (Parklife!)
I feed the pigeons, I sometimes feed the sparrows too, it gives me a sense of enormous wellbeing (Parklife!)
And then I'm happy for the rest of the day, safe in the knowledge there will always be a bit of my heart devoted to it

All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their parklife

Parklife (Parklife!)

It's got nothing to do with your Vorsprung durch Technik, you know

Do you feel like a chainstore?
Practically floored
One of many zeros
Kicked around, bored
Your ears are full but you're empty
Holding out your heart
To people who never really
Care how you are

So give me coffee and TV
Easily
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead, virtually
Sociability
It's hard enough for me
Take me away from this big, bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again

Do you go to the country?
It isn't very far
There's people there who will hurt you
Because of who you are
Your ears are full of the language
There's wisdom there, you're sure
Until the words start slurring
And you can't find the door
So give me coffee and TV
Easily
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead, virtually

So the story begins

City dweller, successful fella
Thought to himself, "Oops, I've got a lot of money" (Lot of money)
Caught in a rat race, terminally
I'm a professional cynic but my heart's not in it
I'm paying the price of living life at the limit (To the limit)
Caught up in the century's anxiety
Yes, it preys on him (Preys on him)
He's getting thin (Getting thin)
Try the simple life

He lives in a house
A very big house in the country
Watching afternoon repeats
And the food he eats in the country
He takes all manner of pills
And piles up analyst bills in the country
Oh, it's like an animal farm
That's the rural charm in the country

He's got morning glory and life's a different story
Everything's going Jackanory (Jackanory)
Touched with his own mortality
He's reading Balzac and knocking back Prozac
It's a helping hand that makes you feel wonderfully bland
(Close your eyes, try it)
Oh, it's a century's remedy
For the faint at heart (Faint at heart)
A new start (New start)
Try the simple life
He lives in a house
A very big house in the country
(Blow, blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why)
He's got a fog in his chest
So he needs a lot of rest in the country
He doesn't drink, smoke, laugh
Takes herbal baths in the country
(Blow, blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why)
But you'll come to no harm
On the animal farm in the country
In the country, in the country, in the country

Blow, blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why
Blow, blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why

Oh, he lives in a house
A very big house in the country
(Blow, blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why)
Watching afternoon repeats
And the food he eats in the country
He takes all manner of pills
And piles up analyst bills in the country
(Blow, blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why)
Oh, it's like an animal farm
That's the rural charm in the country
Oh, he lives in a house
A very big house in the country
(Blow, blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why)

This is the next century where the universal's free
You can find it anywhere, yes, the future has been sold
Every night we're gone and to karaoke songs
How we like to sing along though the words are wrong

It really, really, really could happen
Yes, it really, really, really could happen
When the days, they seem to fall through you
Well, just let them go

No one here is alone, satellites in every home
Yes, the universal's here, here for everyone
Every paper that you read says tomorrow's your lucky day
Well, here's your lucky day

I remember flashbacks lighting up Magic Whip
Eight o'clock, Kowloon emptiness, handle it
The white horse image I had of you eleven seconds ago
I didn't send you, so you will never know
I got away for a little while
But then it came back much harder

Swinging on a cable up to Po Lin
Climbing panda, ghostly wine, and a battery
That light in your eyes I search for religiously
When it's not there, oh Lord, it's hurting me
I got away for a little while
But then it came back much harder

'Til I ever hold you out there again, will you be mine?
'Cause I'm on a ghost ship drowning my heart in Hong Kong
It's the last ride boarding here tonight
Out in the bay (Out in the bay)
I'll need a lantern in you to shine out bright rays

Feeling out of body here, what can I do?
It's up to the top every day to join with you
I had to get away for a little while
But then it came back much harder
'Til I ever hold you out there again, will you be mine?
'Cause I'm on a ghost ship drowning my heart in Hong Kong
It's the last ride boarding here tonight
Out in the bay (Out in the bay)
I'll need a lantern in you to shine out bright rays

I met him in a crowded room
Where people go to drink away their gloom
He sat me down and so began
The story of a charmless man
Educated the expensive way
He knows his claret from his Beaujolais
I think he'd like to have been Ronnie Kray
But then nature didn't make him that way

He went na-na-na-na-na, na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na

He thinks his educated airs, those family shares
Will protect him, that we'll respect him
He moves in circles of friends who just pretend
That they like him, he does the same to them
And when you put it all together
There's the model of a charmless man

Na-na-na-na-na, na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na
He knows the swingers and their cavalry
Says he can get in anywhere for free
I began to go a little cross-eyed
And from this charmless man I just had to hide

He went na-na-na-na-na, na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na

He talks at speed, he gets nose bleeds
He doesn't see his days are tumbling down upon him
And yet he tries so hard to please
He's just so keen for you to listen, but no one's listening
And when you put it all together
There's the model of a charmless man


He thinks his educated airs, those family shares
Will protect him, that you'll respect him
And yet he tries so hard to please
He's just so keen for you to listen, but no one's listening

Where's the love song to set us free?
Too many people down
Everything turning the wrong way 'round
And I don't know what love would be
But if we stop dreaming now
Lord knows we'd never clear the clouds

And you've been so busy lately
That you haven't found the time
To open up your mind
And watch the world spinning
Gently out of time

Feel the sunshine on your face
It's in a computer now
Gone to the future way out in space

And you've been so busy lately
That you haven't found the time
To open up your mind
And watch the world spinning
Gently out of time

And you've been so busy lately
That you haven't found the time
To open up your mind
And watch the world spinning
Gently out of time
Tell me I'm not dreaming
But are we out of time?

Soon it will be gone forever (En plein soleil)
Infatuated only with ourselves (Jusqu' la fin)

And the bright rays we got in summertime
Seemed like a breath of fresh air back in the summertime
When we were more like brothers, but that was years ago
So if it doesn‚Äôt seem like a protocol

I'm running out of heart today
I'm running out of open road to you
And I know you are emoting and you're dazed
Is something broke inside you?
'Cause at the moment I'm lost
And feeling that I don't know if I'm losing you again

And when we fly tomorrow over the Java seas
And my younger maps will be there with me
'Cause they remind me of swimming out too far one day
Then the coral was gone, but I didn't care anyway

I was running out of heart that day
I was running out of open road to you
And I know I was emoting, I was dazed
Is something broke inside me?
'Cause at the moment I'm lost
And feeling that I don't know if I'm losing you again
I'm running out of heart here
Just sitting out the constant doubt in my head
But I don't know what it is
I'm sweating out the toxins
Is my terracotta heart breaking?
I don't know if I'm losing you, if I'm losing you again20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Please, turn your back and walk away
I don't want to see you 'cause I know the dreams that you keep

What am I to do
Someone here is really unhappy
Put myself on the line
It seems I never got through to you
So I wean myself off slowly

I'm a darkened soul
My street's all pop music and gold
Our lives are on TV
You switch off and try to sleep
People get so lonely

I believe, I believe, I believe
Everything's out to sea
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe that is the way it should be
I hope you feel the same

Everyone is dying
Stop crying now here comes the sun
I didn't mean to hurt you no no no
It takes time to see what you have done
So I wean myself off slowly
I believe, I believe, I believe
Love is the only one
I deceive, I deceive, I deceive
I deceive cos' I'm not that strong
Hope you feel the same

And now it seems that we're falling apart
But I hope I see the good in you come back again
I just believed in you13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She says there's ants in the carpet, dirty little monsters
Eating all the morsels, picking up the rubbish
Give her effervescence, she needs a little sparkle
Good morning TV, you're looking so healthy

We wear the same clothes 'cause we feel the same
We kiss with dry lips when we say goodnight
End of a century, oh, it's nothing special

Sex on the TV, everybody's at it

Sad drunk and poorly, not feeling so great
Wandering lost in a town full of frowns
Sad drunk and poorly, dogs digging up the ground

Here comes the ice cream man, parked at the end of the road
With a swish of his magic whip, all the people in the party froze
Screwball, chocolate chip, umbrella in his white glove hand
Shade from the sun was his intention

Here comes the ice cream man, bouncing up the hill
With a wick, the pumpkin lit, Happy Valley cones he fills for
All the lantern men, marching down till dawn
Morning come, we fall over

Something new
Something you
Something new


Here comes the ice cream man, parked at the end of the road
With a swish of his magic whip, all the people in the party froze

I was racing in my heart back then

What do you got?
Mass produced in somewhere hot
You'll have to go on the Underground
To get things done here
(And then you have to see)
If you need a yellow duck, service done
This is a place to come to, or, well, it was
Another hot spot, oh, oh
Crossing on the guillotine

And if you have nobody left to rely on
I'll hold you in my arms and let you drift
It's got to be that time again
And June, June will be over soon again

So get yourself up, get a pass glitch on your way
It's nothing to be ashamed of
Taking off again
The 5:14 to East Grinstead
(You've sent me off to see)
And we go up, up, up, up, up
Coursing on our greatest night
And talking types will let us down again
Talk, talk on your arse all night
You wanna be there
Step inside the tarmac ride
To the land that crime forgot
Oh, just don‚Äôt go there
Cracks inside the tarmac ride
To the land that crime forgot, oh no

And if you have nobody left to rely on
