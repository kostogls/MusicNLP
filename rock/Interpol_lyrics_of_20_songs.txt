I wish I could eat the salt off of your lost faded lips
We can cap the old times, make playing only logical harm
We can cap the old lines, make playing that nothing else will change

But she can read, she can read, she can read, she can read
She's bad
She can read, she can read, she can read, she's bad
Oh, she's bad

But it's different now that I'm poor and aging
I'll never see this face again
You go stabbing yourself in the neck

And we can find new ways of living
Make playing only logical harm
And we can top the old times
Claim-making that nothing else will change

But she can read, she can read, she can read, she can read

You go stabbing yourself in the neck
But it's different now that I'm poor and aging
I'll never see this place again
And you go stabbing yourself in the neck

It's in the way that she posed
It's in the things that she puts in my head
Her stories are boring and stuff
She's always calling my bluff
She puts the, she puts the weights into my little heart
And she gets in my room and she takes it apart
She puts the weights into my little heart
I said she puts the weights into my little heart
She packs it away
She packs it away
She packs it away

It's in the way that she walks
Her heaven is never enough

Heaven restores you in life
You're coming with me
Through the aging, the fearing, the strife
It's the smiling on the package
It's the faces in the sand
It's the thought that moves you upwards
Embracing me with two hands
Right will take you places
Yeah, maybe to the beach
When your friends, they do come crying
Tell them now your pleasure's set upon slow release

Hey, wait
Great smile
Sensitive to fate, not
Denial
But hey, who's on trial?

It took a life span with no cell mate
The long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
He speaks about travel
Yeah, we think about the land
We smart like all peoples
Feeling real tan
I could take you places
Do you need a new man?
Wipe the pollen from the faces
Make revision to a dream while you wait in the van

Hey, wait
Great smile
Sensitive to fate, not
Denial
But hey, who's on trial?

It took a life span with no cell mate
By the long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
You're weightless, you are exotic
You need something for which to care
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?

Leave some shards under the belly
Lay some grease inside my hand
It's a sentimental jury
And the makings of a good plan
You've come to love me lightly
Yeah, you come to hold me tight
Is this motion everlasting
Or do shudders pass in the night?
Rosemary
Oh, heaven restores you in life
I spent a life span with no cell mate
The long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
You're weightless, semi-erotic
You need someone to take you there
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
Why can't we just play the other game?
Why can't we just look the other way?23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

"This one's called 'Stella Was a Diver and She's Always Down'"

When she walks down the street
She knows there's people watching
The building fronts are just fronts
To hide the people watching her

Down a manhole in that bad way
The underground drip
Was just like her scuba days

Daze

But I'm sick of spending these lonely nights
Training myself not to care

I know there's such a place
I had my back turned, you didn't realize
I'm lonely
You lack the things to which I relate
But I see no harm
Come wait, come wait, come wait

Yeah, one, two, three, do me

When I'm feeling lazy, it's probably because
I'm saving all my energy to pick up when you move into
My airspace
Move into my airspace
And something's coming over me, I see you in the doorway
I can't control the part of me that swells up when you move into

She says it helps with the lights out
Her rabid glow is like braille to the night
She swears I’m a slave to the details
But if your life is such a big joke, why should I care?

The clock is set for nine but you know you’re gonna make it eight
So that you two can take some time, teach each other to reciprocate

She feels that my sentimental side should be held with kids' gloves
But she doesn’t know that I left my urge in the icebox
She swears I’m just prey for the female
Well then hook me up and throw me, baby cakes, 'cause I like to get hooked

The clock is set for nine but you know you’re gonna make it eight
All the people that you’ve loved, they’re all bound to leave some keepsakes
I’ve been swinging all the time, think it’s time I learned your way
I picture you and me together in the jungle, it would be ok

I’ll bring you when my lifeboat sails through the night
That is supposing that you don’t sleep tonight
It’s like learning a new language
Helps me catch up on my mime
If you don’t bring up those lonely parts
This could be a good time
It’s like learning a new language
You come here to me
We’ll collect those lonely parts and set them down
You come here to me

My head abounds
Oh, the feeling
And she wept "hold me again", I made no sound
Oh, the beating
And she swore love is never done
So easily
And we went over again, my head abounds
Oh, the feeling

She said you don't need time
Be tame, you won't meet your mate inside
My faith won't lie
He said you don't need mine
Behave, you wanna leave my lady lovers
Of my eighteen summers alone
She said, you don't read minds
Be patient, you won't leave me shaking
Leave me shaking

I've bathed in nothing but sweat
And I've made hallways scenes for things to regret
My friends they come
And the lines they go by

Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

I live my life filled with no pain
Just some rage and three kinds of yes
And I've made stairways such scenes for things that I regret
Oh, those days in the sun
They bring a tear to my eye

Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

But you're so young

You look in my eyes
You're so young, so sweet, so surprised
I saw a sign it says "OK"
Gotta take a ride, just recline in the faraway
Gotta take some time to realize
That my friends they come
And the lines they go by

Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

Well, you should trust in this, girl, cause loving is coming our way

If you can fix me up, girl, you'll go a long way

On what future do we build illusions?
If you really love nothing
Do we wait in silent glory?

What part of betrayal do you wish to deny?

Splendid, I bled my whole life
So it’s probably a kiss
Goodbye then

Better than seven other men
Wayward from women who break dimension

The next artery
Splendid, I bled my whole life
