I miss you, I miss you
Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)


Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you181EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again? What's my age again?

Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again? What's my age again?

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
(What's my age again? What's my age again?)
That's about the time that she broke up with me (Please stay with me)
No one should take themselves so seriously (Please stay with me)
With many years ahead to fall in line (Please stay with me)
Why would you wish that on me?
(Please stay) I never wanna act my age
(With) What's my age again? (Me) What's my age again?

What's my age again?49EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone


I never conquered, rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I've survived
And I can't wait 'til I get home
To pass the time in my room alone96EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always, I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting
Commiserating

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home

Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na

Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares
Just say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home

Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na


Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill

(Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na)
Say it ain't so, I will not go
(Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na)
Turn the lights off, carry me home
(Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na)
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill

Get ready for action!

I got no regret right now (I'm feelin' this!)
The air is so cold and null (I'm feelin' this!)
Let me go in her room (I'm feelin' this!)
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way you move (I'm feelin' this!)
Fuck it, it's such a blur (I'm feelin' this!)
I love all the things you do (I'm feelin' this!)

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

Where do we go from here?
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feelin' this!)
Our breathing's got too loud (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feelin' this!)
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feelin' this!)
Take me away from here (I'm feelin' this!)
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

This place was never the same again after you
Came and went, how could you say you meant anything
Different to anyone standing alone on the
Street with a cigarette on the first night we met
Look to the past and remember and smile
And maybe tonight I can breathe for a while
I'm not in this scene, I think I'm falling asleep
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)
Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)
Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)

It's alright to tell me what you think about me
I won't try to argue or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons
The season is calling, your pictures are falling down

The steps that I retrace, the sad look on your face
The timing and structure, did you hear he fucked her?
A day late, a buck short, I'm writing the report
On losing and failing, when I move, I'm flailing now

And it's happened once again, I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands, and sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone, and I've been here for too long
To face this on my own, well, I guess this is growing up

Well, I guess this is growing up

And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last, when he's gone, I won't come back
And it'll happen once again, you'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands and sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone, and you've been there for too long
To face this on your own, well, I guess this is growing up

Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up

In the car, I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm too scared of what you think
You make me nervous, so I really can't eat

Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss
Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

There's an echo pulling out the meaning
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I...
I'm not coming home

Save your breath, I'm nearly bored to death, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken, lost and cold, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long

There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me

And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I...
I'm not coming home
Save your breath, I'm nearly bored to death, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken, lost and cold, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down
I said, "I'm sorry I'm a bit of a let down"
But all my friends are daring me to come over
So I come over and over and over
So let me buy you a drink, and we'll pretend that you think
That I'm the man of your dreams come to life in a dive bar
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over
And we'll go over and over and over

Save your breath, I'm nearly bored to death, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken, lost and cold, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh (life is too short to last long)

It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted, it's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home?
I'd read it every day

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?

It's not right...

Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems
They never solve them, it makes no sense at all
I see them everyday
We get along, so why can't they?
If this is what he wants
And it's what she wants, then why is there so much pain?
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?

It's not right...

I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying
And your hands, they shake with goodbyes
And I'll take you back if you'd have me

So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?

Come on, let me hold you, touch you, feel you, always
Kiss you, taste you all night, always

And I'll miss your laugh, your smile
I'll admit I'm wrong if you tell me
I'm so sick of fights, I hate them
Let's start this again, for real

So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?

It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm too scared to stay
I said I'd leave, I could never leave her
If I did, you know I'd never cheat her
But this, I ask, it's what I want to know
How would you feel if I should choose to go?
Another guy, you think he'd be unlike me
Another guy, you think he'd wanna fight me

She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

I heard it once, I'm sure I've heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say, "You've got to turn your back and run, now"
"Come on, son, you haven't got a chance now"

She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here

I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
’Cause I don't really like myself without you
I really wish I hated you

A little drunk, waiting on your phone call
A little numb, maybe I can't feel at all
You stitch me up but you can’t stop me bleeding out
I'm better when I'm broken

I love you, but I hate you when you're with someone else
And I want you wrapped around me, but I don't trust myself
I drove by your house, but you don't live there anymore

'Cause I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
’Cause I don’t really like myself without you
I really wish I hated you right now
Won't you say something?
Won’t you say something?
I really wish I hated you
Won't you say something?
Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you
The sun is out, I'm dying in the daytime
I think about the future that we left behind
I drank it all, but I can’t shake you from my mind
Now every window's broken

I love you, but I hate you when you're with someone else
And I want you wrapped around me, but I don't trust myself
I drove by your house, but you don't live there anymore

'Cause I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to

I really wish I hated you right now
Won't you say something?
Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you

I can see that you've had enough
I can see that you're giving up on me
I can see that your hands are up
I can see that you're giving up on me
I hate the way that you're better off, better off
I numb the pain but it never stops, never stops
Wish I could say that I'm better off, better off now
But I don't really like myself without you

I'm a wreck, I'm out of time, I barely made it out alive
I'm not bent, I'm not cracked, I'm just broken
I watched the fire burn the sea, I wrapped my car around a tree
Hold me up underneath this heavy burden

There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach

Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company, I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company, I don't need anyone

Tied up to a heart of stone, I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home
Lay with me, I can't sleep, misery loves company
When I'm bent, when I'm cracked, when I'm broken

There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach
Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company, I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company, I don't need anyone

I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone

Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down
In the dark awake, and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
And I won't be there and you're all alone
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion)

Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company, I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company, I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone

Got a lotta heartache, he's a fuckin' weasel
His issues make my mind ache, wanna make a deal
'Cause I love your little motions you do with your pigtails
What a nice creation, worth another night in jail

He's a player, diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out, friends were listening to Slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with Mom and trying on his father's tights

Life just sucks, I lost the one
I'm giving up, she found someone
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag

So all you little ladies, be sure to choose the right guys
You'll come back to me maybe, I'll shower you with lies

Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there

She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it, I swear

Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window

Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fuckin' explanation
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window

Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance, I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting

I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "What?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window

Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
With the girl at the rock show

With all of this I know now, everything inside of my head
It all just goes to show how nothing I know changes me at all

Again, I wait for this to change instead to tear the world in two
Another night with her, but I'm always wanting you

Use me, Holly, come on and use me (We know where we go)
Use me, Holly, come on and use me (We go where we know)

With all of this I feel now, everything inside of my heart
It all just seems to be how nothing I feel pulls at me at all

Again, I wait for this to pull apart, to break my time in two
Another night with her, but I'm always wanting you

Use me, Holly, come on and use me (We know where we go)
Use me, Holly, come on and use me (We go where we know)

She's all I need, she's all I dream, she's all I'm always wanting
She's all I need, she's all I dream, she's all I'm always wanting you
I'm always wanting you
I'm always wanting you

Use me, Holly, come on and use me (We know where we go)
Use me, Holly, come on and use me (We go where we know)

She's all I need, she's all I dream, she's all I'm always wanting
She's all I need, she's all I dream, she's all I'm always wanting you

Oh, again I wait for this to fill the hole, to shake the sky in two
Another night with her
I'm always wanting you
Another night with her, but I'm always wanting you5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah, my girlfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero just because

Yeah, just because

And my girlfriend likes UL and DHC
And she's so smart and independent, I don't think she needs me
Quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer

And when I feel like giving up
Like my world is falling down
I show up at 3 A.M., she's still up watching Vacation
And I see her pretty face, it takes me away to a better place, and

I know that everything, know that everything
Know that everything, everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything, know that everything
Know that everything, everything's gonna be fine
Yeah, my girlfriend takes collect calls from the road
And it doesn't seem to matter that I'm lacking in the bulge
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me Mexican food from Sombrero just because

And when I feel like giving up
Like my world is falling down
I show up at 3 A.M., she's still up watching Vacation
And I see her pretty face, it takes me away to a better place, and

I know that everything, know that everything
Know that everything, everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything, know that everything
Know that everything, everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything, know that everything
Know that everything, everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything, know that everything
Know that everything, everything's gonna be fine


I know that everything, know that everything
Know that everything, everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything, know that everything
Know that everything, everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything, know that everything
Know that everything, everything's gonna be fine
I know that everything, know that everything
Know that everything, everything's gonna be fine8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
