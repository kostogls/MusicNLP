Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

'Cause after all this time, I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you

Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever
And after all this time, I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you

Well, some things just, some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I (Hey)
Some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time (Hey)
I'm into you
Baby, not a day goes by
That I'm not into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you

All that I want

Tell me that I'm all right

All that I want
Is a hole in the ground
You can tell me when it's alright

Hit that, hit that snare

I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!
Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him right now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

I watched his wildest dreams come true
And not one of them involving you
Just watch my wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving


Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good

When I was younger I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

But darling
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul
That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone
Or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content
With loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream
Whoa-oh-oh

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

And I'm on my way to believing

Man, you really know how to get someone down
Everything was fine, until you came around
And I've been chasing after dreamers in the clouds
After all wasn't I the one who said
To keep your feet on the ground?
Man, you really brought me back down

Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

You got me tied up, but I stay close to the window
And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go
I'm hoping someday maybe I'll just float away
And I'll forget every cynical thing you said
When you gonna hear me out?
Man, you really bring me down

Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me
Reality will break your heart
Survival will not be the hardest part
It's keeping all your hopes alive
When all the rest of you has died
So let it break your heart

Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

About the world you want to see

The optimist in me

I love making you believe
What you get is what you see
But I'm so fake happy
I feel so fake happy
And I bet everybody here
Is just as insincere
We're all so fake happy
And I know fake happy

So I been doin' a good job
Of makin' 'em think
I'm quite alright
Better hope I don't blink
You see, it's easy when I'm stompin' on a beat
But no one sees me when I crawl back underneath

Hey, if I smile with my teeth
Bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me

Oh please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh what's the use?
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too
And if I go out tonight
And dress up my fears
You think I look alright with these mascara tears?
See, I'm gonna draw up my lipstick wider than my mouth
And if the lights are low, they'll never see me frown

Hey, if I smile with my teeth
Bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me

Oh please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh oh, what's the use?
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

I know I said that I was doing good and that I'm happy now

No, sir
Well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
It's your turn
So take a seat, we're settling the final score
And why do we like to hurt so much?
I can't decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why?

That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

And that's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
'Cause I burned
Every bridge I ever built when you were here
I still try
Holding onto silly things, I never learn
Oh, why?
All the possibilities, I'm sure you've heard

Pain, make your way to me, to me
And I'll always be just so (So) inviting
If I ever start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me
Let's start, start, hey!

Why do we like to hurt so much?

But it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around

Tomorrow makes it better

And when it's dark out, no one's around

And the salt in my wounds
Isn't burning any more than it used to
It's not that I don't feel the pain
It's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore
And the blood in these veins
Isn't pumping any less than it ever has
And that's the hope I have
The only thing I know that's keeping me alive
Alive

Gotta let it happen

I dove in again 'cause I'm not into giving up
Coulda got the same rush from any lover's touch
But why get used to something new?
'Cause no one breaks my heart like you

When you kiss me, I wish we could see what happens next
For a moment, I could forget what happens in my head
If I doubt you, would you come through?
Happy second chance or happy ending
But this time you don't leave me sinking

(I'm underwater) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm giving up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in

As if the first blood didn't thrill enough
I went further out to see what else was left of us
Never found the deep end of our little ocean
Drain the fantasy of you
Headfirst into shallow pools
And I wonder, is it better to get it over with?
The illusion, can shatter before we begin
If you're really sorry
Happy second chance, think I could forgive
This time you won't leave me sinking

I'd best be on my way out
You treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
I guess I'll go

Ignorance is your new best friend
Ignorance is your new best friend

I am going away for a while
But I'll be back, don't try and follow me
'Cause I'll return as soon as possible
See, I'm trying to find my place
But it might not be here where I feel safe
We all learn to make mistakes

And run from them, from them
With no direction
We'll run from them, from them
With no conviction

'Cause I'm just one of those ghosts
Traveling endlessly
Don't need no roads
In fact, they follow me
And we just go in circles

Now I'm told that this is life
And pain is just a simple compromise
So we can get what we want out of it
Would someone care to classify
Our broken hearts and twisted minds
So I can find someone to rely on
And run to them, to them
Full speed ahead
Oh, you are not useless
We are just

Misguided ghosts
Traveling endlessly
The ones we trusted the most
Pushed us far away
And there's no one road
And we should not be the same
But I'm just a ghost
And still they echo me
They echo me in circles21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Standing here like I'm supposed to say something
Don't hold your breath, I never said I'd save you, honey
And I don't want your money
If I was you, I'd run from me or rip me open
You'll see you're not the only one who's hopeless
Be sure to put your faith in something more
I'm just a girl and you're not as alone as you feel
We all got problems, don't we? We all need heroes, don't we?
But rest assured, there's not a single person here who's worthy

La, la la la la la la
Don't let me let you down

(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Hey baby, I'm not your superhuman (eh, eh, eh, eh)
And if that's what you want
I hate to let you down (eh, eh, eh, eh)
I got your hopes up
Now I got you hoping (eh, eh, eh, eh)
That I'm gonna be the one to let you down

Oh, it's such a long and awful lonely fall
Down from this pedestal that you keep putting me on
What if I fall on my face? What if I make a mistake?
If it's okay a little grace would be appreciated
Remember how we used to like ourselves?
What little light that's left, we need to keep it sacred
I know that you're afraid to let all the dark escape you
But we can let the light illuminate these hopeless places
La, la la la la la la
Just let me let you down

(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Hey baby, I'm not your superhuman (eh, eh, eh, eh)
And if that's what you want
I hate to let you down (eh, eh, eh, eh)
I got your hopes up
Now I got you hoping (eh, eh, eh, eh)
That I'm gonna be the one to let you down
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Oh, no, I ain't your hero (eh, eh, eh)
You're wasting all your faith on me
Oh, no, I know where this goes (eh, eh, eh)
Think it's safe to say your savior doesn't look a thing like me

La, la la la la la la
Don't let me let you down
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Hey baby, I'm not your superhuman (eh, eh, eh, eh)
And if that's what you want
I hate to let you down (eh, eh, eh, eh)
I got your hopes up
Now I got you hoping (eh, eh, eh, eh)
That I'm gonna be the one to let you down
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Hey, baby I'm not your superhuman (eh, eh, eh, eh)
And if that's what you want
I hate to let you down (eh, eh, eh, eh)
I got your hopes up
Now I got you hoping (eh, eh, eh, eh)
That I'm gonna be the one to let you down14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Found these old letters from years ago
Felt it was fitting to continue that correspondence
Can't help I'm sentimental
Thanks for talking with me today, I hope this is helpful for you
I also hope that Birdie is happy and healthy and staying out of trouble to a reasonable extent
What I wrote was sort of my way of finally being able to address how it feels to have 
Another brick-red room, another black-top town
Another misspelled band burning their own houses down
Another pine-box tune to fill the cemetery day
Another star, a touch of orange over purgatory gray
Another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed
Another song that runs too long, God knows no one needs
More misguided ghosts, more transparent hands
To drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our riot! dance
Beneath another burning sky, behind our painted lips
In scores of catatonic smile-covered ankle-bitten ships
So throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea
As protection from the paper-thin perfection you project on me
When this repetition ends behind the window shades
A semi-conscious sorrow sleeping in the bed I've made
That most unrestful bed, that most original of sins
And you'll say that's what I get when I let ambitions win again
I'd hate to let you down so I'll let the waters rise
And drown my dull reflection in the naive expectation in your eyes
Back in a cast bit-part, back when I felt most free
I had a butcher's heart and no one thought they knew me
So before the regiment resumes, before the dreaded sun appears
My driver's waiting, so let's make one point crystal clear:
You see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
You see a flood-lit form
I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine

I see myself in the reflection of people's eyes
Realising that what they see may not even be close to the image I see in myself
And I think I might actually be more afraid to let my own self down than anything else
I feel like the man in the story
Who saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat
Twelve years ago I stood on the shore
And jumped in and grabbed the coat
The river was rushing toward a waterfall
And, and my friend stood at the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land
I let go of the coat but the coat won't let go of me
In any case please let me know if there's more I can give you
If nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

She lives in a fairy tale
Somewhere too far for us to find
Forgotten the taste and smell
Of a world that she's left behind
It's all about the exposure
The lens I told her
The angles were all wrong now
She's ripping wings off of butterflies

Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds
Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle

Ba-da-ba, ba-da-ba-ba-da

So one day he found her crying
Coiled up on the dirty ground
Her prince finally came to save her
And the rest you can figure out
But it was a trick
And the clock struck twelve
Well, make sure to build your home brick by boring brick
Or the wolf's gonna blow it down
Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
We'll bury the castle, bury the castle

Whoa-whoa-oh
Whoa-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

Well, you built up a world of magic
Because your real life is tragic
Yeah, you built up a world of magic
If it's not real
You can't hold it in your hand
You can't feel it with your heart
And I won't believe it
But if it's true
You can see it with your eyes
Oh, even in the dark
And that's where I want to be, yeah
(You'll be better off without me)
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle (Ooh), bury the castle
(You'll be better off without me)
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle (Ooh), bury the castle

Ba-da-ba, ba-da-ba-ba-da
Ba-da-ba-ba, ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba, ba-da-ba-ba-da
Ba-da-ba-ba, ba-da-ba-ba (Ba)
Ba-da-ba, ba-da-ba-ba-da
Ba-da-ba-ba, ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba, ba-da-ba-ba-da

I can't think of getting old
It only makes me want to die
And I can't think of who I was
'Cause it just makes me want to cry, cry, cry (Cry)

Can't look back
Can't look too far ahead
I got the point
I got the message

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
I gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah, I'm caught in the middle

I was dreamin' life away
All the while just going blind
Can't see the forest for the trees
Behind the lids of my own eyes

Nostalgia's cool
But it won't help you now
A dream is good (Don't wear it out)
If you don't wear it out
And I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
I gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah, I'm caught in the middle

No, I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself
Don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself
Don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no help
(All the glory days are gone)
I can sabotage me by myself
(It's over now)
Don't need no one else
(I'm on my own)
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no help
(All the glory days are gone)
I can sabotage me by myself
(It's over now)
Don't need no one else
(I'm on my own)
I can sabotage me by myself
And I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
I gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah, I'm caught in the middle
I'm caught in the middle11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
